       "\"okay okay that was a little louder okay welcome everybody to office hours it's december 21st and i'm joanna katzman i think i'm i think carla thornton is not here today um and uh i just wanted to let everybody know it's really good to see you i we had a great session last week talking about the new pfizer vaccine and really appreciate dr sosa dr hayes and dr sivers being on and giving such great updates just wanted to let everybody know that if you have a camera and it's on fantastic if you don't and you can put it on please do so it really is in line with the echo model and we can see you and it aligns with better uh better teaching also our fantastic digital librarian kent knowsworthy is on and he's always ready uh and always uh putting evidence guided and evidence-based information from our speakers and our subject matter experts into the chat which you can copy and paste and put into your browser and and take with you right away and finally um please don't hesitate to put any questions i see some already coming in to put any questions that you have into the chat because we have eliminated the pre-registration pre-registration questions and i really want to get your questions covered as soon as possible so with that i'd like to turn it over to dr sosa dr nester sosa nester is our chief of infectious disease at university of new mexico school of medicine and we're so happy to have us having him lead us so thank you nestor thank you joanna thank you very much let me get my slides on the screen one second okay i have prepared actually two sets of slides one with the latest article and if if there are a lot of questions on the modern vaccine i also have a few slides with information from the modern vaccine but i'll leave it for the for the end after the discussion um out of respect for the other for the other um experts here on in the panel i i already saw a question on the new uh strain or new variant uh from the uk so i decided to start with with that uh and there are a few um communications already scientific communications about this on top of everything that has been um discussed in the in the late press so this is this is one of those uh you know high uh headlines that the really scary headlines that i that i saw over the weekend the secretary of health of of england saying that that kobe 19 is out of control and there's this new this new strain so what do we know about about it before i go into that i'm just going to give a brief overlook or overview on how these mutations are identified because you're going to see people throwing letters at you with you know the n501 mutation which is very important blah blah blah so i want to just a quick review this is sort of a biochemistry thing so you know the proteins are made of of amino acids so there are a lot of amino acids that can make a protein and they are identified either by the three letter code like alanine is allah but they also have a letter um so in order to sort of uh uh to get an abbreviated um uh change in the in the proteins the the the way the the the scientists refer to these changes in protein is they mentioned the new amino acid i'm sorry the original amino acid in the protein in which position the change has occurred and the name of the new amino acid so in this case um there was uh asparagine here and was substituting in position 501 by y which is basically theoretic tyrosine or tyrosine so that's that's essentially what these numbers and you're going to see these numbers and they're others like when there's deletions or insertions they are slightly different but that's that give you a general idea so what is this new this new stream first of all it was detected in september so it's not completely new started uh you know the scientists in the uk and many other countries they actually doing uh genome sequencing of of the virus circulating to see what type of mutations that we know the rna virus do mutate so they have changes here and there uh but then all of a sudden like it happened a few months ago with the d6614 mutation this new uh this new strain seems to be uh seems to be becoming more frequent in the uk and it's already reported in other in other places in in europe so they they actually no notice that this new variant which are calling either bui 202012 0 1 or b117 it's so complicated also people refer to it as n501y because this is like a dominant mutation in the in the receptor binding domain um actually this new variant has between 17 and 23 mutations so it's really a pretty a pretty uh mutated uh spike protein from the virus and some of the mutations are important the 501 the one that sometimes gives the name it's in the receptor binding domain so this is the area where where actually the the protein attaches to the ace two receptors so any changes there obviously need to be uh studied carefully there's also uh another important site in the other side of the protein the sort of the furing cleavage side and there's a mutation there so that that may have some some translation into changes in the behavior of the virus it may have occur and this is a speculation um because the virus is circulating human population we're using convalescent plasma so it may be a disaccumulation a mutation may be actually a mechanism of the of the virus escaping the immune attack of of you know from from from serum plasma or antibody use um they have already been more than 3000 isolation of these uh of these wires with these mutations and it's actually according to a source very frequent 62 of the recent strains from london have this mutation um and there's also this is also speculation they feel because it's becoming so prevalent that it's also um transmits more rapidly or or more readily but to be honest i think we still we know that the mutation is there we know that it's it's becoming abundant or frequent but i think all of the other concerns are still theoretical we need to confirm uh that in fact is transmitted with experiments in ferrets or or other animals to see if their emission is or in cells to see that it transmit more readily uh we have to see the clinical course to see if it's more severe or less severe there's no reports of that it's too early yet yet we need to also see and there's another concern do the vaccines also cover this this strain where we have to take serum from people who have been vaccinated and see if that serum neutralizes the virus this this strain we haven't seen that they're probably running to do these experiments in the uk as we speak but we we haven't seen any any publication or pre-publication though the monoclonal antibodies like bangla limit works against this we don't know we have to do the experiments and the experience have to be reviewed on public so i think there's many many questions i wouldn't really um you know be too too concerned although the warhead organization and some governments are already restricting travel from the uk the uk went into a lockdown because you know it's the careful and the right thing to do uh until you get all these questions answered because if all the questions the answer is a wrong answer if the vaccine doesn't work the monoclonals do not work then you need to find alternatives so in the meantime the good thing is to try to to prevent the transmission so that's all i'm i'm going to say but it's so and if you see in the illustration i i skipped that but the it has a deletion so it had lost par these two amino acids position 69 and 70 which is actually in an important area of the virus and this is the receptor binding domain has several highlighted in red several mutations in this area which is the area where the virus attaches to the to the a2 so you can you can you know you can speculate that yeah those changes maybe maybe alter the behavior of the virus as a whole and make makes it could make it more efficient to infect cells we just don't know we have to to wait for that okay let's move on uh and these are all the changes it has many many mutations this is a list of the mutation i already mentioned the n501 the one um that that it's in the in the active site and there but there are many others so that's that's important and people are looking for these mutations in their in the virus that they're isolating um there's another interesting paper out of korea i'm always impressed by these studies done in japan korea and in china about contact tracing because they do have like a very sophisticated way to do contact racing um and the story goes the the the the investigators in korea found three uh young adults um uh with with uh with sarcoby2 with infection and they couldn't you know find who infected them so they actually use uh an app that actually um uh evaluates where you you have been in the days before your infection so they can actually track you know uh geographical where where have you been and they actually during this this um investigation they found that these three persons not related not family they didn't know each other had been in a restaurant at the same time the same day so then they went ahead and look at the at the close circuit tv of that restaurant and they actually were able to to establish where these persons were in the restaurant and they found that one person that we call the infector is case b case b infected these two other persons that were detected through this contact racing um one person interestingly enough was 6.5 meters away from the infector b um and only five minutes in the restaurant without a mass so they coincided only for five minutes in the restaurant the other were coincided in the restaurant or where together in the restaurant or at the same time for 21 minutes but he was also 4.8 so you know it was kind of unusual these long distances i mean they were unmasked so they when they look at the distribution they found this is case b this is the the blueprint of the of the restaurant yellow are the tables um the see the shares around the table you can see there are four shares around each table the infector that we're calling in factor mr b mr b was here and mr c and a the two person that became infected from this person were uh 4.8 and 6.5 meters away and what they discovered is that the air movement and they studied the air movement in the restaurant um the the stream from the ceiling air conditioning move like this as you see the arrow it bounce against the wall here and then it goes straight into these two persons so only those two persons became infected all of these other person that were in the restaurant did not become infected so this highlights one the possibility of transmission in a longer distance number two the importance of air circulation in a room obviously this person who was in front of me also got infected this was his um you know the person that went to to to eat uh with this person b he also got infected but then that b infected these two that were relatively far away so i think it's a it's an elegant experiment that combined you know the close circuit tv uh airflow uh airflow dynamics in the in the in the restaurant and obviously the contact tracing app that was able to put this person in the same place at the same time um using this uh technology okay the regarding therapeutics is a new um a new drug that has been studied for kobe uh this was part of the nih act study in fact it was the act ii and it's called varicity which is uh it's a janus kinase inhibitor and i just want to show you quickly the results of the story varicity um the janus kinase it's it's it's really an intracellular enzyme that that helps the inflammation so it's sort of pro-inflammatory so in many rheumatic disease rheumatologic diseases um you can use this inhibitor of the janus canis and decreases the inflammatory cytokine production it may also have some antiviral effect and also increase increases the lymphocytes so the investigator at the nih decided to to treat the patient with rendezvous which is sort of the standard of care for hospitalized patients with with hypoxemia and they added by sitting into one of the arms uh and actually the varicity was given every day four milligrams for 14 days with the render severe for less than 10 days or up to 10 days they actually um did this top of line randomized uh in which one arm receiver and their cv varsity but we did this study at unm we were one of the sites uh dr harkins was the uh the principal investigator so one arm had rendezvous very seating the other one rendezvous alone they unroll a thousand over a thousand patients um and what they found the main result was actually a shortening in one day of the recovery the the endpoint was time to recovery and they found seven days with the rendezvous varicity versus eight days so um one day short no no big not a big finding but at least one day recovery although when they look at patients in what they call the the level six which are patients basically on high flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation so these are patients who are sicker than the regular patients that come and are receiving oxygen by by just a nasal cannula they are in high flow or non-invasive but they're not intubated or ecmo so that that's that group in that group particularly they found a larger difference 10-days recovery versus 18 days rendezvous so it shortened it shortened the recovery by eight days the combination of rendezvous by sydney and there was also a 10 um a trend towards lower mortality the 28 day mortality was 5.1 for the combination 7.9 from the during this year but it crosses one so it was not uh statistically significant so i think a lot of places hospitals um infectious disease society of america are analyzing these results and and and thinking and considering the addition of barista i would say if anything for patients who have this more severe disease with high nasal high flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation this is the the graft that we have seen this similar graph you can see how varsity uh recovery tended to be better than placebo almost throughout the whole uh period of follow-up okay and then another this is more an epidemiological study which i found very interesting um and and answers the question in part the question what happens if we let the virus run unmitigated uh and this has happened in some places in latin america for instance peru people are are studying the the prevalence in peru and it's over 50 percent um in in some areas also in some areas of mexico is over 50 percent of the population have already been infected so this this scientist actually did a study in brazil in two cities in brazil they did in manaus which is in the amazon it's a two million uh um two million uh inhabitant city in in the in the center of the amazon and sao paulo which is one of the largest cities in the world and you can see they used uh you know some modeling and they they actually tested uh donors in blood banks and and donors you know in in in these two different cities and you can see that according to them close to 75 um of the of the people that lives in manaus brazil have already been infected by um october uh of this year so and you can see this is the curve in gray you can see the curve how high when a number of cases per day and then it went down but it probably went down because of her immunity actually because a lot of people had already been infected according to her calculation obviously much less in in sao pablo which is a different they did a different intervention here the the epidemic was basically left on mitigated there was no significant contact tracing because of lack of resources so the the epidemic really uh became very widespread here it was much more controlled and nevertheless they have close to 25 29 uh positivity so interesting uh epidemiological paper and finally i think dr herzmann i don't know if he's here but he he asked me to review this this paper which i have already seen uh and and you remember that early in the epidemic people were um speculating that maybe if you if you get something like if you if you get mmr vaccine or if you get bcg the tuberculosis vaccination it may help indirectly protect you against kobe 19. well these these authors actually did a study i'm going to show you the study they did a study in which they they took 80 people and they divided the 80 people in 50 and 30 50 were um younger folks who who presumably had received or had evidence in their medical history of uh of reception of nmr2 so the newer the the current mmr vaccine and then the other 30 were older folks who were not vaccinated or had natural infection and they actually measured the levels of antibodies in both groups and they found that those who had a high level of antibodies against mumps which is not really similar to kobe but but this was the finding so patients who had a high mumps tighter not missiles not rubella which are the two other viruses and vaccine exclusively mump there was a clear-cut correlation between high antibodies and protection so people with very high level were basically functionally functionally immune meaning that they have been exposed um very close exposure to to to sarcoby 2 and no no infection or they became infected but were symptomatic if their level was 1.1.3 and so on the lower the level of antibodies against mumps the higher the severity of the disease so it was a it's obviously an association uh it needs to be um corroborated by other studies but it's interesting that if you have antibodies against mumps which has not been reported before you seem to be protected so there you go so you know the the logical thing would be to do actually mmr vaccination and and and prospectively evaluate that intervention but i think probably now with the vaccines coming down down the down the line it's it's probably not a big big issue but it's interesting nevertheless this finding and finally i just want to i'm not going to do any any um vaccine study today but i just wanna for for those who who because i get a lot of questions um in other in other sessions that i do how do mrna vaccine work i found this illustration very simple so the mrna vaccines are actually um messenger rna encoded in a lipid in a lipid nanoparticle and this is done number one to protect the mrna from from lysis when it's entered into the into the human body when once it's injected and second because the lipid uh code helps the the mrna enters a cell it produces what we call a transfection of the cell and then the mrna gets into the cytosol into the cytoplasm of the cell and and and then it's translated into the proteins that in this case all of the mrna vaccine that we have so far encode for the spy protein and then the spy protein um is either release and and it stimulates production of antibody or it's actually presented to the to the cells using the major histocompatibility complex is presented to cd4 cells and cda cells and they recognize either the parts of the spike protein or the whole spike protein and then there's an immune response cellular and humeral immune response so this is the way so injecting mrna mrna becomes protein protein is partially digested presented to the immune system as foreign and then there is a reaction or or production of antibodies and cellular immunity and that's what converts the protection that we have seen recommended reading i i found uh actually jama the journal of american medical association um reviewed the most viewed articles so if you can go into the jama webpage and look at these they have many articles but one uh really struck me it's an editorial or a viewpoint from dr burbrick uh we have heard about like the social determinants of health and he elaborates on moral determinants of health so really very interesting very engaging reading of these of these papers i highly recommend is it doesn't it's not related to copy directly it's just direct uh you know related to to health in general and what he calls the moral determinants of health and finally uh don't forget today is the great conjunction of saturn and jupiter in the sky um this is a photo i took in my patio a couple of days ago so the two planets are gonna um are gonna be very close in the sky so i really uh invite you to do it this hasn't happened since since um the year 12 26 so so it's been it been more than 800 years since this two planet have looked so close in the sky so please uh tonight look at the look at the the sky for for a minute and look for this it's usually very close to the horizon uh looking west um you're gonna see and probably probably uh below the the moon the moon is is higher up and finally i'd like to thank everybody who's been in this um in this echo uh thank you really for helping me walk through this pandemic uh keeping me interested and motivated and sharing knowledge and learning from from you guys and thank you for for uh diaco project to give me this opportunity i just wanted to [Music] give everybody happy holidays thanks i'm going to start sharing here dr sosa i think we all want to thank you so much really it's i really want to thank you for helping me personally get through the pandemic you've been really a life source and i think a source for all of new mexico so thank you so much really thank you for your amazing uh teaching and wish you a happy new year um wanna move on to don't forget to continue to put in your great questions and wanted to move on to dr leslie hayes who's also been so instrumental leslie hayes is a family medicine physician and an addiction medicine physician in espanola with el centro family health all right can you guys hear me yes we can all right so for those of you who weren't here last week i asked um the providers in my organization and also on a cobit group on facebook what they had learned from the pandemic that they were going to continue to use afterwards and the questions the answers i got were just so interesting so i just enjoying them so a lot of people talked about the things they were going to learn about infection control and given how much controversy there is nationwide i was really surprised healthcare workers there was no question everybody was just like masks masks are great we're going to keep wearing masks so people talk they're going to wear mastering flu season possibly for the rest of their career all the time and then everybody should be wearing a mask when we have uri symptoms kids should wear a mask in school during flu and cold season children can be more resilient than we think they can wear masks all day at school while some adults can't wear one at the grocery store and people are talking about they just happily and blindly ran into rims in emergency medicine and i've always amazed we wear masks for the kids for rsv but when they were in the emergency room asked for them so but another comment was i touch my eyes way too much and to avoid hospital break rooms handshakes can go away forever blowing up birthday candles this one actually makes me sad i love birthday cakes i love birthday candles but and i didn't even think about it till people started talking about it but really it's kind of gross to blow all over a cake and then eat it schools are incubators of disease take children out of schools infectious diseases and children practically disappear and some of the practices such as hand washing before eating that people always said oh we can't possibly implement it maybe we can do them in the post covered world i love this one i recognize that my estimation of a 20 second hand wash was actually much shorter than an actual time 20 second hand wash i never realized how many times i licked my fingers in life turning pages opening up plastic produce bags etc it's kind of disgusting in retrospect i still haven't figured out how to properly open the plastic produce bags just taking me an extra 15 minutes at the grocery store to open them without licking my fingers handshakes time to do away with them i cringe when i think of how little i used to clean my stethoscope also the whole cleaning the stethoscope thing when those sand wipes are out it's so easy when you have to hunt them down it's much harder and at the very least get rid of ties meetings there are a lot of disagreement on meetings um many people were of the opinion we should never have an in-person meeting again um it's much easier to have visiting professor presentations virtually because you don't have to pay for travel zoom family meetups are a nice way to connect with people there should be a lot less meeting you should go through email and meetings should make decisions information should go through email and then other people were like i really miss in person meetings more than anything it's too easy to get distracted with zoom i love zoom meetings i can just you know pause in the middle of my rounds and then go back and finish seeing patients i remember everybody's names and there's no travel to cities i don't love visiting i definitely think this is true somebody commented that every meeting should at least have a zoom option and then people deciding whether or not to have their videos on or off the weekly department meeting is much better attended now um people talked about conferences and annual assemblies being virtual not perfect and you miss out on some stuff if it's not in person but it's really much more convenient you can play the sessions back and you don't miss sessions because they overlap and your money goes a lot further and then one comment that all board certifying agencies should just give all of the physicians and physician assistants and nurse practitioners maintenance of certification credit for this year because we've all spent so much time learning so many different things and then some consume meeting disadvantages there's no boundaries for work-life balances so many 7 am and 6 pm meetings and then somebody said just you know it made her sad that um people didn't want visitors or in-person um meetings to continue and so much of the humanity in medicine is that personal connection and then there are some interesting comments about visitors um and many people were saying they actually wanted to continue to limit visitors even after the pandemic maybe not a popular view but it's nice not having spouses present ov visits the office runs much more efficiently without guests or kids so nice not to have arguing parents grandparents and sibs in the room no parents coming back to the or to put the kids to sleep the kids do so much better without them it is much easier to take care of patients with a single family member in the room rather than finding my way through a crowd without extra visitors i can ask personal questions about safety and trauma without asking the parent or partner to leave and i think it's definitely something worth looking at of you know putting limits on the visitors i know when i was in the hospital i found i slept much much more than i did whenever i had visitors and i just i could focus on recovery so but this comment i think was really really important no one should ever be made to die alone in a pandemic and i'm gonna go through one more thing here self-care um taking time off when you're sick does not make you weak a lot of people commented there's no reason to wear anything but scrubs to work ever again the importance of self-care allowing people grace during difficult times and somebody commented that now that we're working from home so much it's often hard to ask for time off because it's just too easy to call in remotely a lot of people talking about biking to work to avoid public transportation and then never take any opportunity to see loved ones for granted before covet i almost didn't go to a friend's birthday party and they didn't know it would be the last time they could hug or see her same with visiting long-distance relatives no more i can just go next year and this was my absolute favorite comment how about women physicians to look great even without makeup dress clothes or high heels so and i'll go through the rest of them next week for two weeks thank you thank you dr hayes uh fantastic um and just a reminder that dr hayes also said yes we are not uh we're not gonna meet next week but we will we will meet the first monday in january thank you dr hayes super super interesting comments i think a lot of us can relate to many of those um and let's turn it over to marla sivers from new mexico department of health i know you've been really busy and have some updates possibly on the modern vaccine yeah thank you joanna just wanted to share a couple of updates about the approved or the eua authorized moderna vaccine a couple of differences i'll just highlight from the pfizer vaccine i think one of the most important being is that it doesn't require the ultra low uh cold storage so makes it a little easier for distribution and so our first shipments of the modern vaccine will be arriving in new mexico this week and that initial allotment the state of new mexico has earmarked for our long-term care facilities so our our initial moderna allotment will be earmarked for residents and staff in both nursing homes and licensed assisted living facilities and that vaccine distribution will happen through the federal pharmacy partnership with walgreens cvs and a local pharmacy group called vita pharmacy so we're looking forward to getting those vaccines distributed in long-term care facilities as you know they've been really disproportionately hit with not only cases among their residents and staff but deaths as well so hopeful that this is uh you know a positive sign for long-term care the moderna vaccine is approved for use in people 18 years and older so you remember the pfizer vaccine is approved for use in people age 16 and older so a change there or a difference and the madonna vaccine the second dose is administered four weeks later for the pfizer vaccine that's 21 days for moderna for weeks on modernist site they say one month the cdc site says four weeks hopefully they'll get a little more precise about that time period because i can already imagine all of the questions as you know does that mean 28 days 30 days 31 days so hopefully they tighten that up a little bit to just cut down on the confusion many things about the vaccine are the same they're also recommending that the vaccine not be co-administered with other vaccines and that you wait at least 14 days before or after receiving another vaccine [Music] the moderna vaccine is in a multi-dose bile that contains 10 doses it's not diluted unlike the pfizer vaccine um and same recommendations for vaccinating pregnant and lactating people uh people with immune compromise i think that was my only update for today thanks thank you so much thank you so much marla we so appreciate you coming on we know how incredibly busy you are and uh you do so on your own time and we're so appreciative um i think we have carissa uh colebrook on too and i just wanted to introduce carissa culbreth as one of the medical directors from tricore lab chris are you there hi i'm here can you hear me yes yes and i'm not sure you have any updates but just wanted to just want everyone to know that you're here if there's any questions about the laboratory testing or anything else that chris is on today thank you um great well let me um let me start some questions um and uh i think i might well i'm looking for the first question i think i might ask uh nestor or marla the first question and that um i think there's just there's either maybe there's not controversy but i think there is a difference in the two vaccines and that the moderna trials have um has have shown that um there is some um protection or lack of uh once once once patients are vaccinated with the moderna vaccine they're unable to kind of um spread the virus to others that there's kind of no shedding or there's no ability to spread but that hasn't been the case is my understanding with pfizer just yet can you kind of clarify that uh for for me or for us yes i can i can at least give some comments um yeah that's correct i mean pfizer uh did not mention anything about infection prevention there was one table in the document that um moderna sent to the to the fda in which they actually mentioned that before dose number two so patients got their first dose and when they went for the second dose they did a swap and they found 14 patients or 14 subjects with a positive pcr in the vaccine arm versus 38 positive pcr in the placebo meaning that there were more asymptomatic infections much more in the in the placebo than in the vaccine so the conclusion or the the the analysis of that data means that that at least it confers some protection and when you calculate vaccine efficacy in that very limited information is around 66 so there's a around 60 to 70 percent prevention of asymptomatic infection but this is very limited you know it's just one one swap in day you know vaccine day number two or or yeah vaccination day number two um what pfizer mentioned in their paper was that they they are going to do serology and they're going to do they're going to present an analysis on the serological conversion of those vaccinated with the placebo and the vaccine and they're going to know if there was more asymptomatic infection in the placebo than the vaccine but they haven't really done that they're probably running the test right now to be able to to publish or communicate that information so that's that's all we know but you're right pfeister has not really revealed how the ability of the vaccine to prevent infection moderna very limited information 14 against 38 uh from you know 13 000 um people who receive the the vaccine or the placebo um approximately so uh my my personal take is that there there is going to be some effect in in in viral infection we just have to really look at more data to see how much and how significant it's going to be that uh reducing the the the pandemic or the the reality in a population based uh uh situation thank you thank you nestor i mean if you think about any of the other you know if you think about polio or measles or monks mumps or any kind of large vaccination programs the thinking is that you're probably not going to be able to transmit the disease once you're fully vaccinated but i guess the the truth will be in huge large scale vaccinations and see what happens is that right okay and i just wanted to let you know i wanted to introduce we have folks on today from peru and nigeria and welcome welcome to you all um so i think we answered dona um orgaron's questions about the mutation from britain nestor sosa did um and we have a question from a rick foster a rick would you like to unmute and ask your question about the neutralizing antibodies yeah thank you two brief ones how does the neutralizing antibody which is the one that is going to cure you relate to the igg antibody that we test for and is there an update on how long that uh post-infection immunity may be conferred yeah i can i can answer there have been a few studies in which they actually uh determine igg antibodies so general antibodies against anything any part of the virus versus a specific neutralizing antibody which are usually directed against the spike protein and there is a correlation and carissa can can also help me there is a correlation so when when a person develops general antibodies within those antibodies there is a subpopulation of of really effective neutralizing antibodies so there's a general correlation um so so it's it's it's a yes the question there is there is correlation the the the second part of the question the duration we still don't know i mean with the the latest study uh earlier studies show that there was a decline in the antibody production but i think the feeling of the experts now based on the latest publication is that the high fly for those antibodies is pretty long we're talking 160 days half life so it's going to last much longer to to decrease and also uh we are encouraged by the fact that that the immune system has these memory cells both memory t cells and memory b cells that although they may not be producing antibodies or actively circulating in the blood they're hiding in the in the lymph nodes waiting for the virus to enter and once you get exposed to the virus the the reaction kicks in there's like a like a mnemonic or memory reaction with newer antibody production and also uh t t-cell response so so the hope is that at least for for you know a good several months we're going to have uh protection we don't know further than that because there's no really uh long-term studies the bodies have been around only for less than a year or or a bit over a year so so um so we don't know but at least from the kinetics of the curve of antibody the slope is really very slow so you can you can make that there it's going to last for a few months um hopefully enough to to control the pandemic yeah just an fyi i actually had coveted and i had two eliza tests one in may was 3.69 and i just had one two weeks ago it was 3.64 so that's seven months that's pretty good you're hanging in there good that's good that's very good thank you so much rick seems like you're you're doing well yeah um thank you for the for the great question rick uh carissa did you want to add to anything that that nestor said no uh nestor hit it right on the head um we had a study that we conducted at our facility um among a very small study about 35 patients that had a positive antibody test and looked at the presence of neutralizing antibodies in those patients with a collaborator from the university and found that neutralizing antibodies were detected in a good number of the population i think about 70 of the people that had antibodies we detected neutralizing antibodies in and there was a good correlation between the signal to cut off ratio that's generated by the base the antibody igg screen compared to the neutralizing antibody titers thank thanks carissa thanks rick for the great question um jeffrey miller had a question that i think early on in the epidemic we talked about quite a bit which was ivermectin um and just wanted to ask you nestor have you seen any recent articles on the benefits of ibermectin um or not so much in recent literature right yeah there was a publication a retrospective a study from from florida in which they found some benefits of ivermectin in hospitalization but this was really early in the pandemic people were getting acetomycin hydroxychloroquine it was really not a very uh pristine methodologically speaking pristine trial there was also study from bangladesh and and more recently and this is completely off the record investigators in colombia actually told me that they completed a randomized double-blind placebo control story with over 400 subjects and they found no benefits in early copy so i think there's a mixed bag we haven't really seen any any conclusive evidence in favor or against but most of the societies like idsa nih are not incorporated number mectin based on what is available so i think we need to wait for the publication of the studies but you know talking to these colombian colleagues uh my my bias is that it's not going to be um you know a miracle cure it's you know they did a very well designed study and showed no benefit early on so um it's it's unfortunate but i think that that's the way it's going to be thank you nestor i think we can uh plan not to use either ivermectin anytime soon right now thanks for the great question though and then we had some questions about from donna or goran and john foster earlier when you were talking nestor about you know what was going on with that mutation in the in the uk is it really due to that gene mutation or could there be an could there be just could there have been one or two super spreader events that might have caused kind of the outbreak and and then a trevor hawkins asked could there be a fitness cost to the mutations that would make the virus less virulent that kind of a different kind of question so wanted to get your take on those yeah those are a great question i don't think we have the answer for all of them i mean we can sort of uh analyze the situation obviously it doesn't seems to affect the fitness because it's it's going up if you look at the frequency it's becoming more prevalent in in some areas in the uk so at least it doesn't look like it's uh you know it's a weak virus or or a virus that is not able to infect humans um the the why why it it occur we don't really know i mean there i've i've reviewed three articles on the weekend um on this thing and and people think that it may be the pressure of of of using convalescent plasma in some cases that there is there is a similar strain isolated in south africa and and we have seen a virus evolution within us a person within a patient especially immunosuppress you give them plasma and the virus keep changing or mutating like we we used to see this with hiv all the time that that you put patients on therapy monotherapy therapy and the virus just keeps evolving more and more resistant so something similar may have occurred with some of these viruses the more they interact with the human immune system the more mutation they accumulate and some of those mutations help them um fare better so so you know that that's that's what we know we still have there's a lot of experiments and verification that they need to do to answer these these questions one question that i saw uh about this same subject so i'm going to just ask it and and carissa can help me they in one of the publications one of the late press publications they mentioned that because this affects the spike protein um it may affect the sensitivity of the of the pcr especially if you are if you are doing pcr tests of that section of the of the genome so um it it could it could happen so i do i don't know carissa have you heard anything and do you think it's it's is that possible because that's a concern they they they're asking like you know then we're not going to be able to detect if we use just a pcr that detects uh just the the the mrna for the rna for spike protein yes so actually the majority um we went back and looked at our assays our pcr assays actually when um the vaccine came out just to check to see if there would be any um cross reactivity between the vaccine and any of our assays and we know the vaccine also targets spike there's only one assay that we use in our laboratory and and spike tends to be a less common target for pcr testing so we only have one assay that we're using in our laboratory that targets spike many of the others target um the orf um one a and b or the n proteins um and so so it's less frequently recovered but in our our lab we are doing collaborations and many people are doing this across the country collaborations with individuals who are doing um sequencing of the virus to be able to identify common mutations and there's some databases that have the manufacturer primers and probes aligned with mutations that are being observed around the world to be able to see this proactively and so right now the mutation that's been observed is not aligning with any of the molecular assays most likely because spike is not commonly targeted thank you great um there's this is joanna again there's been a number of questions about um kind of vaccines for healthcare workers that might work not in hospitals but in kind of more solo or small practices not so getting the vaccine for themselves but also how they can start looking to kind of access the vaccine for their patients and i'm wondering if maybe marla might be able to start to speak on that perhaps if she might have kind of answers to that now that we have both the visor and moderna vaccine sure i can uh let you know uh what the plans are that are underway um so new mexico published our draft vaccine plan um actually on our cv.nm health.org website so if you've not taken a look at that there's a short kind of executive summary and then the longer plan kind of lays out what new mexico's plans are for prioritization of different groups um and you know for this very first tier where vaccine supply is very limited you know targeting obviously those front-line health care workers um primarily in hospitals who are taking care of hospitalized patients um and then people in long-term care settings as we discussed then as more vaccine supply becomes available in the next few weeks you know then we're looking at moving down into sort of from tier one a to tier one b which looks at you know other healthcare workers and people in other congregate settings as being a priority group and then expanding from there you know week from weeks so the goal is of course to get as many people vaccinated as possible as quickly as possible part of that just depends on how much vaccine is coming into the state and it's not uh you know really in our control we get an allocation each week from the federal government and we don't know until right before it happens how much we'll be getting and so those decisions about uh priority distribution have to be made as we get that information week to week however the way to get plugged in to vaccine availability is through our immunization program and so i think this week insists the new mexico vaccine registry if you're a vaccine provider with the state of new mexico there was uh new features in cis to be able to start um kind of pre-ordering vaccine so looking at how many healthcare workers you have in in your facility who is at high risk who would you prioritize you know if you had vaccine available so starting to gather that information more widespread from you know all private practices you know physicians offices um hospitals other health care settings so trying to really anticipate what that need will be for rolling that out and so log into your sis portal and look for that those new features to be available where you can start to communicate what your vaccine needs are going to be if you're not already a vaccine provider with the state of new mexico reach out to our vaccine program and there's a dedicated email address for that and it's covid dot vaccines at state dot n m dot u s so you can reach out to the program directly using that email address and get some more information about how to get plugged into vaccine distribution if you're not already participating in the statewide program and then as more vaccine becomes available especially the modern vaccine which is easier to distribute you know what we hope to see is that you'll be able to get a vaccine through a provider like walgreens or cvs a pharmacy provider the way you do now you know for your flu shot or your or your tetanus shot that sort of thing um so like i said the goal is to make sure as many people are getting vaccinated as quickly as possible but it's really just the constraint on supply that's going to dictate sort of how that rolls out and the public health offices will also be involved in vaccine distribution so as we start to move to the next priority groups and looking at people like ems and other first responders the public health offices throughout the regions will be taking a lead role in helping distribute vaccine to those groups as well and so that's another option is um connecting with your local public health office especially if you're in one of the more rural areas of new mexico to talk to them about availability of vaccine clinics when they think that will be happening and how to make sure that you know when it's going to happen so you can be plugged into those resources marla outstanding thank you so much for that update i think you answered uh literally about eight questions there and i think many more that uh people did not check but were thinking in their mind um do you mind just chatting to uh do you mind just typing in in the chat that um that email or web website if you don't already are not hooked into vaccinations um you know the address that you could yes i will do that and i see there's another question about um adverse event reporting right so i'll just touch on that quickly so there's you know there's the vaccine adverse event reporting system um by fda which will be very important for monitoring adverse reactions there's also a new web app um for people who get the vaccine so it um is based on your smartphone it's called v safe it's optional but people can opt into it and it's sort of a real-time surveillance system for adverse events so you'll get your first message about your vaccine experience how you're feeling after having the vaccine within two hours of receiving it and then uh daily thereafter and you'll be uh monitored for several weeks so those will be two primary uh sources for tracking those adverse events and then also again through the vaccine program at department of health thanks thanks marla um marla i know this the cdc you know um shortly after their criteria for how they were going to vaccinate the u.s population came out meaning the healthcare frontline healthcare providers and and then nursing home people in nursing home in congress setting second they then added another kind of category whereby elderly and fair individuals who are living in multi-family housing whereby their their younger their their kids and grandkids who are taking care of them who who might be at risk for giving their elderly patients elderly family members covet would qualify under kind of that nursing home category is new mexico going to stick with that same criteria yeah if you look at the draft plan we submitted you know it was sort of um high-risk folks you know with underlying health conditions or people who were elderly but not living in sort of institutional settings uh were in that sort of late phase 1b tier you know phase 1b moving into phase 1c i think it's tricky right how do you identify those people and i think that's where the healthcare providers who are seeing people in private practice are going to be important with helping identify those folks and making sure they get plugged get plugged into that whether it's through a pharmacy through the um health department or in their own office so i think that's primarily how we'll be able to identify those folks but yeah it's a question and the same question has come up about people who you know work in um not necessarily in health care but other essential industries right because that's another group that's been talked about as being prioritized and so how will you identify those people and make sure that they really get appropriately placed in line so i think um that's one of those things that's going to be sort of challenging uh to make sure we're getting to the right people thanks marla um really appreciate it just want to get to one or two more questions before we i have some closing comments there was a question about um when there might be studies or when we might be able to vaccinate those younger than 16. um nestor do you know of any studies underway or when that might be done no i just know that uh for instance pfizer included some patients 12 to 5 to 15 in their study but they didn't analyze that data they didn't present it and i know moderna said that they were going to start studies and younger so i think uh 2021 the first half of 2021 would there probably be be testing and and i think that the you know knowing that that it's safe and effective in adults is going to simplify the work in in children they sometimes they do just correlates or protection so if children receive the vaccine in a small group and and there's no significant side effects and they mount an immune response you don't need to enroll you know 40 000 60 000 children in a study you can do it with with somewhat uh less numbers of of of subjects based on the data from the adults but they they need to do it but probably not as as difficult as it was the first few studies joanna could i just add um for pregnant and lactating women acog has come out with a statement saying that it should be a discussion between the patient and their provider and um that there have been um several pregnant patients people who got pregnant despite everything in the studies who have done fine so far so we should not just say no um that they shouldn't get them because pregnant women are definitely more at risk from covid that's what i understand um is that more pregnant women are taking it than not so but that it is a decision that is between the uh with the ob gy and our family medicine doc and their patient thanks leslie really important and there's one more question about the vaccines given to prisoners and those in other congregate settings marla can you answer that uh yeah my understanding uh based again upon you know our draft vaccine plan was that people living in other high-risk congregate settings were going to be in the next group so sort of the phase 1b thank you marla well wanted to remind everybody that all the sets of slides are in the chat so please look for them as is your cme link is in the chat actually again it's it was in the chat at 45 minutes after the hour and kent noseworthy our digital librarian just put it in the the chat now um the cme link even if you do not need cme and if you have a few extra minutes please fill it out um dr uh tomati who is leading the focus groups uh wants to thank you if you've been able to participate in them and nestor and carla and and i and leslie also want to thank you very very much wanted to remind you all that we will follow up the first monday um in january we won't be meeting next week our other programs this week the first responder and critical care are not are not going to be held we're kind of off the rest of the week and then i also wanted to just let you know that we're starting a a climate change in human health echo uh mid february we have speakers from uh noah from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration from the national institute of environmental sciences from the cdc from the yale climate uh change center many speakers all over the country speaking eight consecutive weeks from mid february to mid april on wednesdays at 10 a.m i'll give you more information after the first of the year but mainly just wanted to thank you all uh for participating and being our colleagues and have a wonderful and safe and restful and happy new year thank you you\""

you hear me yes could hear you great i'm glad to um i'm glad that it's working now um let me just and can you see me okay yes that's much better good actually actually it's weird my angle with this it looks like i'm looking down but i'm actually looking at the if your camera's not attached to the um the computer screen correct right right um i'm just gonna have to do the best i can right today okay how about now i mean let's see with it it's okay with the angle that you have your computer screen and the angle of the camera it does appear that you're not looking directly at um the camera but it's not terrible how about if not now does it look like i am yes so when i make my announcements i'm gonna be okay now let me actually now let me open box um okay now now let me read from box and see if i'm it looks like i'm looking at the camera can you tell me absolutely so one of the questions is blah blah blah blah blah does that look make it look like i'm looking at the camera um it it's you're looking slightly down but it's not it's it's pretty close okay perfect i'm just gonna go with that awesome okay and i'm gonna i'm gonna try to go connect with carl and c who who wants to do intros i'll be right back okay yeah and i had started that group text message so okay thanks rebecca so much thank you hello dr sosa do you want to check your volume and sound hello one two three perfect good thanks great how are you doing today good awesome yeah today i'm in the hospital so i have to go see patients later after the the this session okay well i'm sure this session will go really well today and so um thanks for being here and if there's anything that comes up just let me know okay thank you rebecca thanks okay hello dr thornton i see that you're uh joined us hi oh hi there you are thanks sure your sound sounds pretty good so good good afternoon everyone and welcome to infectious diseases office hours we're really happy to see everybody my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician at the university of new mexico and one of the associate directors at project echo and i'm happy to be here with you today i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is also one of the associate directors at echo and we are co-facilitating this so she'll be helping with the questions um when we get uh to that point so again really appreciate appreciate everyone being here i just have a couple of announcements before we get started um as many of you know project echo we like to see people's faces and we feel like it builds community so if you have a video camera and you can turn it on we would love to see your face uh we also will try to address all of the questions that we got in the pre-registration and and we but we encourage questions during the session itself so if you have a question about something that's being said or just a question that you weren't able to submit please put it into the chat box we'd actually appreciate for people not to answer those questions in the chat box chat box and to leave them to the the to dr sosa and the other um expert panelists that we have invited today a couple of other things if you we we do have our digital librarian kent northworthy is putting things into the chat constantly he'll whenever he hears something he'll put a reference to that and we have we can now uh click directly onto those those hyperlinks for the last couple of weeks we've haven't been cut and paste them but we can now actually directly link under the you can uh click onto the hyperlinks and also just wanted to let everybody know that our website's been updated with a bunch of new resources so i'm going to get started i'm going to um i'd like to introduce dr nester sosa he's the chief of the division of infectious diseases at unm health sciences center and as you know he's been doing these opposite hours now for almost a couple of months almost we have a and i'll have i'll let him also just introduce himself and and give you a brief update before we move into the questions but i also wanted to let you know that marla sivers who is an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the department of health and has been involved in other echoes is on today and will i i know that many of the questions will actually be going to her as well so i want to introduce marla and um carissa culbreth i understand is also on she is um one of the directors at tricore laboratories and has been really involved in covid19 testing and i know there are a lot of questions about testing as well so i am going to turn it over to dr sosa and let him again introduce himself and give you a brief update uh on on covet 19. hi thank you carla and thank you joanna uh yes my name is nestor salsa i'm an infectious disease division chief here at unmh and i would like to to go over a few interesting publications that have been revealed in the last few days i think and and in previous echo i had the question of the the relevance of the use of ac inhibitors or or angiotensin receptor blockers if they were harmful or helpful well on may 1st the new england journal actually published the results of three different studies um evaluating this question precisely and there were you know different design studies there was one publication of a database of cases of kobe and they checked their their medication there was another case control from it from italy in which they included over 6 000 patients and another story from new york so these are these are three different um three different modalities of studies and three different methodologies and they all reach the same conclusion and instead there was no harm effect or no association with increased risk of ac inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers and the and the risk for kobe in general and the risk for severe calling and in fact one of the studies actually uh patients who were taking ace inhibitors seem to be protected from more severe disease and this is something that was already observed in one of the earlier stories from china so there is an also an elegant editorial in that in that new england journal issues so i think uh you know we can continue using those uh medications for our hypertensive patients without any significant concern based on these uh uh three really large uh really large uh studies and and and with the analysis done by the new england journal the second the second um issue that i want to raise and i think i've seen this on the news but now has been published in a letter in the new england journal is the increased incidence of stroke in young patients there's a report of five patients younger than 50 years in new york that actually had large vessel strokes um with uh in general no significant risk factor for them except for the fact that they have kobe so there's definitely this association with increased coagulation and strokes not only in elderly patients in the icu but also patients who are younger developing this unexpected quote-unquote unexpected thrombotic events um after having copied or while they're having uh kobe uh another piece of good news i have a lot of questions on ppe um and i think idsa just published i think yesterday will be the day before yesterday uh guidance idsa is the infectious disease society of america so they they publish guidelines about the use of ppe and their opinion about you know surgical mass versus respirators etc they actually address eight questions eight different questions regarding ppe i put in the chat already the reference for the for the idsa guidelines so you can you can check it it's very nice very succinct and practical and they are very much in line of what the cdc have been recommending and we have been been doing here at unm unmh but it's reassuring to see that this uh um expert group has come up with with also with recommendations and there's also an explanation why they they give every every every uh recommendation finally something that we have addressed also that i have mentioned that since the epidemic entered the united states there have been an association with obesity and in the landsat in a recent publication in landsat um a group of researchers from here from the united states and they they gather information from different hospitals and they actually found an association between obesity and copied and not only that that obesity lowers the age risk for copies so the the the higher the bmi the the lower the age necessary to have a severe coping so so so obesity seems to to make younger patients more susceptible to the severe complications of kobi than they have a nice graph there with where they correlate bmi with with age and there's obviously um you know those patients who are young and we're affected and and we're in icu were actually heavier than those that that were not so so now we are recognizing that as a significant risk factor for more severe uh kobe 19 disease and finally the fda um as you know approved the severe uh you know emergency use and they have given also an informational um uh sheet of of of how to use it and i i post the the link also at the beginning of the chat and where you can get instruction for those who are actually at some point in the future going to prescribe this to their patients uh they have very useful uh information there uh the only safety issue or the main safety issue within deciber seems to be lft so we probably have to check or follow the lfd's of this patient so those are the those are essentially the the updates that i that i have and i'm you know more than ready and willing to to answer and discuss questions thank you thank you oh go ahead no no you're okay thank you so much nestor i just i'm gonna turn it over to joanna for questions but i also wanted to just let you know that um also our um colleague laura chevy who's an infectious disease physician with us and real and is really leading the ppe effort uh at unm is also on so any questions about any questions that we can ask about answer about ppe we're happy to to give to laura as well go ahead joanna thanks carla thank thank you mister um joanna katzman here i work closely with dr thornton at project echo i'm a neurologist um i think i might want to see if marla seavers who's one of the state epidemiologists might be able to help us with a couple of questions um uh marlar i think i might have seen you a minute or two on video are you there yeah i'm here joanna oh thank thanks marla um uh there's a couple of questions um one is about the fact that you know we're kind of new mexico surrounded by arizona and texas that have kind of eased up on their uh restrictions and one of the questions is that now that now that texas has kind of opened up their less essential businesses and and many people from el paso come into las cruces for shopping and eating out wondering if there's going to be increased screening in that sector of the state thanks joanna so i think you know we're very concerned about this as well um that we're going to see a surging cases in that region as people are able to travel more freely to texas for routine errands and shopping we have expanded our testing capability in that part of the state by providing test locations every day at the public health offices as well as deploying um i think five of the um abbott rapid platforms in that region um of the state and i looked on i saw that come through chat and i looked on the website today it looks like there's you know five testing locations uh just in las cruces that are open today so there is a variety of testing that is available um you know and to the extent that there is staffing and ppe and locations to conduct testing a department of health is certainly not limiting testing in one region or prioritizing testing coming from another region over over another we try to make test sites available in every county in new mexico through our public health offices as well as partnerships with hospitals and other clinicians who can assist us with that work so there's five places open today in las cruces people can get tested thank you so much marla um also leslie hayes had a question about any more oh it looks like joanna you're muted if you're still on okay yes hi joanna joanna are you there looks like we may have lost joanna i'll try nicole okay thanks matt great so i think you um joanna had asked the question that leslie hayes i'm just looking for it leslie did you want to or marla did you see it on the chat i see it are there any plans to provide more widespread quarantine centers in new mexico i think that was the question from leslie yeah thank you nestor i did see that question from leslie and i can say yes that there are work groups that are working on setting up you know what we're kind of calling non-medical observation centers we do have quite a bit of um quarantine capacity available right now through rooms that have been set up with different hotels around the state to be able to quarantine people who aren't able to quarantine at home um but there are several proposals that are in the works right now from different groups to set up um sort of you know a model where you've got a a non-medical observation site for people who need quarantine a little bit of that is happening in the gallup area but looking at other places in the state for those kinds of centers as well thank you marla before we leave the question of testing there are a lot of questions about testing i have to say and i i know that i'm a lot of people saw probably the article in the newspaper this weekend and just that there's going to be a dramatic increase in the number of tests that are being done daily over time with some support from the cdc i don't know if our like you can just descri can you just tell us a little bit about that and if there's a um a unified approach from the department of health about who will sort of sort of how the testing is going to start to play out are you talking about serology specifically carla no not serologies i mean basically you know the article said that they're gonna we're gonna dramatically increase the number of tests and now they'll be um more people will have tests a bit they can get testing done they couldn't in the past because they didn't meet criteria but i think it just sort of opened up a big bunch of questions about who is actually going to start uh where the what's going to happen with testing in new mexico over the next couple of months sure i think testing has kind of really been rolled out in phases you know we started where everyone started which is really a limited amount of testing and only testing people who traveled or had certain symptoms and over time as more testing has become available in the state and when i say that i really mean uh lab capacity um and specimen collection kits we've you know decreased those barriers over time um and so for several weeks now maybe as long as a month um we've basically said anyone in new mexico um you know can be tested without having symptoms or a travel history or a known exposure there are some companies that have set up their own testing sites which do have their own criteria so i definitely have heard from people that they've gone to a particular site to get tested maybe operated by a health system and that testing site is limiting who they're testing based upon symptoms or other criteria we don't have those restrictions um at any testing that's being done by the department of health so if the department of health is having a drive-up testing event or testing through our public health offices again anyone can be tested the state laboratory as well as tricore laboratories in particular in new mexico have continued to bring on new instruments new equipment and new personnel to be able to perform additional testing so that we're not limited by our lab capacity and those laboratories right now are running you know 24 hours a day seven days a week to process tests and so you know we're really trying to maximize our capacity in the state as well as working with sort of some non-traditional partners as well and i don't know if this was in the article that you read carla talking about testing that might be available through sandia national labs and los alamos national labs as well so we're really trying to expand testing anywhere that we can and again we did um procure 12 of the avid rapid test platforms and deployed those out into more rural areas around the state to assist with testing capacity there but we're going to just continue to add capacity every day at either these clinic locations public health offices you know we're expanding our surveillance testing in nursing homes as well as among other special populations so it's a big push to get as much testing out as possible and there are places around the state that people can be tested without having symptoms or unknown exposure great thank you so much um that's very helpful um i also just wanted again a testing question just like you mentioned serology and there was a test a question about how reliable basically are these tests are the serology tests and how will they be used in new mexico and also karissa's on marla a few i don't know if you have any comments about that but we can also talk to go to her and nestor as well yeah i'd love for carissa to weigh in on that carissa do you um i don't see you on my screen but i believe you're here yeah i'm here sorry i'm having some problems with my camera um so i think we're still learning um about what the serology tests mean um many of the assays uh the the sensitivity of the tests are are decent and the specificity of the test based on the studies that we've done within our laboratory and others they test serum specimens against patients who've been previously infected with other of the common coronaviruses and um ensure that there's no cross-reactivity with those type of coronaviruses and then other viruses so you know it looks like the specificity is fairly good but i think there's still pretty limited indications for use um this is not a test for immunity um because we just don't know what the immune status of persons who've been previously infected um would be so tricor has pretty limited indications for use for our coronavirus antibody test which we now have available but with very very limited indications for use and so i think we have to be very conscious about our use of the test because we're really not sure exactly what those answers uh what a result either positive or negative would indicate in all patient circumstances thank you carissa nestor do you want to talk also go ahead yeah we have here una unm um testing and i'm sorry yeah lab testing committee and they have been discussing how to better use this test obviously with the reservations that clarissa made the comment some potential uses are uh under like a serial prevalent study you can you can probably use it uh just to to gauge how many or what percentage of the population have been affected that's one potential use uh the other is to identify potential donors people who already have immunity and they have a history of the disease and maybe we're not tested you can check for antibodies and and see if you can uh invite them to donate their plasma uh and finally there there may be a few cases of patients that um have a negative pcr but very highly suggested clinical uh picture and you can you can use the test as a sort of a of a um you know to help when the pcr is negative and the clinical situation is highly subjective of the disease i'm not saying that we we are going to use it on all patients you know in those situations but those are probably um potential uses for the serology with the information with the limited information that we have now and the other thing is that they have been in at least in the published literature a lot of variability especially for the lateral flow test and the rapid test that they uh and and we are you know more uh or relying more on on on laboratory based elisa's and other uh as opposed to just rapid tests or point of characters that may be less reliable thank you mister so i mean it seems like from what what what i understand and what what's been said here that there are very few indications for individuals who just request serology testing that it doesn't have a lot of meaning that you won't be able to guide if they're asking you specifically as a provider i think it's very hard to get really good guidance about it and it's not really recommended from what i understand um and marla did you have any comments from the department of health standpoint thanks carla i appreciate your comments carissa and nestor um you know we are concerned here at the department of health um as well about what indications um for ordering these tests will be and how people will want to interpret those results um i think people will want us to make policy decisions based upon those results um and individuals who request that sort of testing um you know are likely to want to use those results um you know to mean things that we can't really say that they mean that allow them to have more freedom of movement you know go back to work sooner um travel that sort of thing so you know we're also concerned about how those results are going to be interpreted and how people will want to use them thank you marla and there's a couple chris if you can just address this and this has come up i think almost every time that we've had a one of these office hours but just talk about the sensitivity and specificity of the pcr testing and there was also a question just about the turnaround time for the pcr tests sure um so sorry the sensitivity of the test you know until we get a chance to dive into the data to look at the clinical sensitivity and specificity we base our determination on um the actual ability of the test to detect virus in a um in a sample um and so all of our tests that we're performing at tricore are highly sensitive fewer than 500 copies per ml and often much lower and other assays that are performed at other facilities will have differing sensitivities um i think it's pretty clearly documented at this point in the literature um that the avid id now does have um is is a bit less sensitive than some of the other methods even some of the more rapid methods like the cepheid um is the abbott id now isn't quite as sensitive as those methods um but the sensitivity again is is good from an analytical perspective and then from a clinical perspective it's really important to look at um the specimen that's collected and having a good nasopharyngeal swab is important um when the patient is in their course of disease we're seeing how much more that is playing a role so earlier in disease there's a higher likelihood that virus would be recovered but later in disease even in a person who's progressing um becoming more symptomatic and they're and they're having a worsening clinical picture we're seeing that there's less virus in the nasopharyngeal space and the virus begins to move down into lower respiratory samples and so in that scenario if a person has been symptomatic for a while and continues to worsen then collecting a lower respiratory sample like a sputum a trach aspirate or a bal is may be more beneficial in those cases the specificity of the test is very very high and there's really no evidence of cross reactivity with either the common coronaviruses or other sars1 or mers viruses i did notice somebody asked about turnaround time i'll tell you at tricore we have a 24-hour turnaround time for our test um and we actually have a graph where we're um we're actually putting it out there um every day and you can see what our average turnaround time is um and you can also see our total volume tested so right now we've been at a 24-hour turnaround time for a pretty good amount of time and and hope to keep it right around that thank you so much back to you joanna okay thank you uh thanks so much carla i'm sorry that i had such technical difficulties um uh i'm gonna turn out from testing to more kind of symptom management and co-infection type of questions a question came in from a clinician in albuquerque saying as a pcp is there anything i should do to manage early covet patients and what about pregnancy uh we this was asked early on and i guess the question really is is there anything kind of new in early management of covet patients no i haven't seen any any significant change aside from just general supportive care keep the patient well hydrated the infection control measures that you need to take if the patient is at home and and also just the surveillance i mean to have contact with the patient uh regarding and instructing the patient when to call the the health center uh obviously if they become short of breath or they have developed cyanosis um or confusion those are clear indications and and um i think even the new mexico department of health and the cdc gave give instructions specifically on how to monitor space at home but there's no um like recommended therapy or antiviral to take at home at this point in fact the rendezvous is an ib medication so it's probably going to be used um almost exclusively in hospitalized very sick patients rather than than early ambulatory or non-hospitalized patients and i i really have nothing else on on pregnancy i mean i saw a publication on a on a miscarriage associated with covet in the literature recently i think it was lancer or jama um that's like the only the most recent thing over the last couple of days and apparently they found some infection or viral presence in the placenta uh something that we haven't really appreciated but it's only one case if i remember correctly uh we're still learning a lot about you know pregnancy and newborns nestor a quick question alan crowe las cruces um i am seeing increasing concern from a number of individuals uh folks monitoring pulmonary status that the lack of shortness of breath is a false uh indicator of stability that these individuals are becoming progressively hypoxic at the uh those that will progress after seven to ten days and then they're crashing because they're not short of breath because they're not hypercarbic there the the virus in some way may be attacking either the red cells or the um uh the capillaries that are lining the lungs or potentially decreasing the amount of surfactant slightly so that they're somehow they're blowing off their co2 but they're not maintaining their oxygen therefore tracking shortness of breath is not a sensitive indicator but performance is that these individuals should be encouraged to be up and walking a a small at least a small amount and any decrement in their physical performance may be an early indicator that they are becoming hypoxic if in the absence of because we may have lots of thermometers but there are not a lot of percutaneous oxygen sensors so that is a suggestion that i have seen repeatedly coming up recently that we should not be depending on on temperature we should be watching these folks to see is their performance capacity dropping i've certainly seen it in uh in a number of the athletes that i have spoken to by phone that have been have had coveted cases frequently that precedes or you know in any case back to you thank you alan yes thank you dr carl um i wanted to go to um some questions of kind of about exposure and and and when there's a family member who might be uh covet who is covet positive and how to best kind of uh keep them sick keep the other members safe some questions came in regarding that the question specifically is read are there any recommendations for families when one person is positive are there any lodging alternatives other than the patient's house and i'm wondering maybe that's a question perhaps for marla sabers so cdc does have recommendations um for how to quarantine someone in the household who's positive but it basically consists of you know keeping them in a separate bedroom with their own bathroom keeping that door closed making sure that they're not you know dining with the family in the kitchen they're not preparing food so really trying to sequester that person in the house as much as possible good surface disinfection you know with a diluted bleach solution or other disinfectant in the household lots of good hand washing and source control having that person wear a mask whenever they're around other people in the house and people who might be caring for them in the home also making sure that they're using a mask exercising good hand hygiene and good surface disinfection and so those are available on the cdc website if you go to what to do if you're sick section on the cdc website it provides a variety of resources for how to care for someone at home or how to care for yourself at home and also how to know when it's safe to sort of return to your activities and go out of the house again so a lot of good resources there there are alternate sites lodging locations for people who need to be quarantined um or isolated and as i mentioned right now those are really contracts with hotels so putting it someone into an individual hotel room who doesn't necessarily need close medical observation and who is able to care for themselves a little different situation if you have someone at home but really requires a lot of supportive care from family members putting them into a hotel room might not be the best choice for them so that's part of the decision making as well is choosing a safe care location for that person but there are sites available where people can be isolated away from their family in hotel rooms if needed can i just ask a question about that please would that be okay um i've posed this question a couple times just in follow-up how how would someone find out about those sites and what would be the criteria to get in excuse me can you uh possibly um we're trying to keep since we've got 140 people on the line we're trying to um uh have people just kind of um you ask questions and chat but can you that's not interesting spoke up i thought maybe it was permissible yeah that's fine no no can you just possibly um introduce yourself that would be great sure sure i'm debbie mcgrew i just turned off my video because i'm eating lunch but um yeah i've asked the question a couple of times and i just would like to see i i've heard recommendations that they contain the spread there's recommendation for people who test positive who aren't severely symptomatic don't really require hospitalization but to be actually separated more more than just in the home and so what i'm wondering is is there any plan in place in new mexico to do that and if how would an average person access that information great question thank you you know this is joanna we we've had a lot of a lot of kind of questions similar to that and we even had a case last friday where a lot of covet positive patients have been come remaining positive for upward of 30 to 40 to even 50 days and so it's a little it's not exactly like your question dr mcgrew but it's it's fairly similar i'm wondering marla or carissa or even a nester if you want to maybe answer that for dr mcgrew i can answer the part of the question about where does someone find out about those resources so every positive case is being investigated by an epidemiologist here at the new mexico department of health and they have an assigned um case manager who's an epi who's following up with that person on a regular basis to assess the progression of their symptoms make sure that they are able to isolate as recommended making sure that they're able to get access to needed medical care or other supplies and through that process discussing with their assigned case manager if they're not able to isolate at home that would be the point of contact to help them arrange that alternate location oh that's great thank you that answers my question great thank you um so i want to actually just change gears a little bit there i wanted to i mentioned that laura chevy who's with our ppe uh group is on and there was a question about ppe in the chat that i think is really important and i'm just going to summarize it many of you may have seen it but and laura please if you can answer this would be great so just about the you know it's very difficult to wear an n95 mask for a long time and and because it's really is they're they're very good and they're keeping air out they're keeping you know keeping you safe but uh the question is about how is there any what is the safety what's the best way to don and doc these masks if you have to wear them for a long period of time um laura you read the question if you could just address it that would be great yeah it's a great multi-part question and my dogs are gonna help answer if you can hear them i'm sorry um so n95 masks actually were studied in different industries and people tolerated them for at least eight hours so the current cdc guidelines for extended use of ppe of n95 masks specifically is 8 to 12 hours five donnings if you reuse so if you take it off in between you doff between patients um so five uses total or eight to twelve hours um from working with our mickey nurses here it's um one mask has not been sufficient for a 12-hour shift in general um when they are practicing extended use not that they can't wear them for the total but they get saturated and need to be replaced so there is a an excellent set of guidelines in the cdc for extended use and reuse of ppe which will answer a lot of those questions um in terms of how to don and off appropriately there's videos there on how to doff and to read on without contaminating yourself or to decrease that risk for people who are needing to wear n95s for extended period of time we do recommend and the idsa guidelines that just came out also support using either a face shield over the n95 um or putting a procedure mask over the n95 during an aerosol generating procedure with a covid positive patient so for covid negative patients that's not recommended for covered positive patients who are not undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for the time afterwards that's required for viral clearance in the room and 95's are also not recommended um i just want to make sure i got the rest of oh and then um storage when you are if you doff the n95 so you doff the face shield and you'd or you'd off the procedure mask over the n95 store it face down on a paper towel um people have been using tupperware's there's actually some really nice videos on youtube where people have cut holes in each of the four sides of the bottom part of the tupperware where the straps go to hold the mask down or on a paper towel or a paper bag it just needs to be a well ventilated area to let the mask uh dry as much as possible i hope that answers all your questions that's a great comprehensive answer thank you laura i'm just gonna again change here so one more time here there's some interesting questions about iga and nestor i don't know if you can answer these but one of them is does low iga due to celiac disease make patients more vulnerable to cova 19 and then the second one is how does iga immunodeficiency affects covid19 susceptibility yeah i haven't seen any specific publications on on immunoglobulin deficiency and copied i would have to do you know do a little search to see if there are case reports or or somebody have looked into that um but i i cannot really answer more than that thanks semester you know one of my colleagues um is a hepatologist and a colleague of mine works with echo robert gishazan as well and i don't know bob do you know about celiac disease if there's been any any information about uh celiac disease and covid i haven't seen anything and i'm like you all monitoring two to three hours a day but i'll raise my alert level much higher now but the iga question is going to become much more pervasive in terms of testing serology whether it's part of the immune response great question i'll watch and i'll let everybody know thank you bob can you just introduce yourself as well uh i'm robert gish i'm a hepatologist i'm based in san diego but i work at many places throughout california nevada i've been working with carla an echo we did a hepatitis b echo i work at a fqhc in san diego called la maestra and i'm the medical director of the hepatitis b foundation thanks for having me i'm attending this meeting thank you bob darling yeah go ahead there are two stories from china in which they actually measure the immune response they measure igm igg and iga and there seems to be an iga response to the virus very similar to in time and magnitude to the igm but that's as far as i've seen qualities great thank you very much um just nestor have you hear i there's a several questions about um the use of convalescent plasma and i wanted to announce that we're going to have in our echo on friday the um medical director of my talent the blood bank here is going to be talking about that so if anyone's interested to come hear her speak about that but can you just give an update about that the use uh in general and also in new mexico right yeah there have been very few published studies none of the studies are rcts or randomized controlled i think there have been a total of maybe 20 25 patients in the literature um and in this own control open label studies most of the authors have commented that that they saw a beneficial effect that's what we know from the literature um there are a lot of places in the u.s including here in new mexico that have started um to use convalescent plasma i was in in a zoom meeting this morning and i think they mentioned seven patients um around seven patients in total in in our state in different different locations we are uh starting a study here at unmh for hospitalization for critically ill patients um so that's as much as i can as i can tell you but i know they're using it in in you know in the united states and there there are a couple of large multi-multi-center randomized trials to test the combustion plasma not only in the faith in the treatment of patients in icu and general awards but even as a preventive measure after after um exposure for instance for for uh household contacts that are in high risk or or even healthcare workers they have a high risk exposure uh they're going to study as a prevention this is a strategy of passive immunity or or plasma transfusion great thank you um back to joanna back to you are you there i can't actually see you okay not oh there you are joanna yeah can you okay great um uh just wanted to see yeah there's a a couple questions about covetous and other skin related problems and as patients are discharged with coping 19 um what should be taught to care for uh how should they be taught to care for covetous would they ever recover and are there other skin related covet 19 problems yes most of the information that we have are from case reports you know a group of you know few patients that have developed these uh dermatological complications and and in fact we have seen this sort of called frostbite uh reports of frostbite uh lesions in in in patients with coping there has also been a couple of macular popular rash associated with almost more billy form rights associated with kobe and more recently especially in kids they have been the report mostly in the news i haven't seen a publication of kawasaki disease which is also has some dermatologic um and inflammatory features uh so so so those are the the the most recent uh you know publications i i don't know exactly if we are giving any any specific instruction regarding when the patient goes home regarding this as a preventive measure for that aside from your surveillance of of the of the of the skin and reporting any lesions i haven't seen any specific instruction we are using as as a matter of fact anticoagulation or or prophylactic heparin or low molecular weight heparin in most of the of the patients that are admitted with copy to the hospital and and and some more intensive anticoagulation once they are in icu and especially if they develop any of the obvious thrombotic complications that have been reported like dbt pe or or or strokes thank you so much nestor um some recent questions that came in on the chat are just uh uh people wanting uh clinicians wanting to know about kind of the latest ideas you've mentioned many under uh risk factors for for being covet positive you know hypertension diabetes obesity but could you just briefly um go over perhaps some more risk factors that that you might not have touched on um in previous weeks okay yes sir i think that the most important and we know that is age i mean patients over age 65 is considered uh you know risk factor for severe disease and and this is something that it's almost like a those uh effect relationship the older you are the higher your likelihood to have complication so age is one obviously the the big ones are cardiovascular disease pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease is defined very broadly and pulmonary disease includes asthma copd and and other acquire and congenital lung disease there have been an association with hypertension which is not very clear and that generated the the question about the ac inhibitors that i talked to at the beginning but hypertension in some of the series have been also important um and then obviously any immunosuppressive state like transplant in some serious and patients who are taking immunosuppressive drug may be more susceptible and here in the united states especially a certain ethnic group or social socioeconomic groups are also considered risk factors uh latinos african-american and obviously we we have an example of the disproportionate number of native uh americans that are being affected in our own state so i think those those are the the most uh important risk factors that i remember they're obviously depending on the on the series that you see they add one or two uh to to those list of risk factors i think and obesity obviously that i already mentioned it's another another important important factor another is interesting one i've seen uh publication in in favor and against smoking i i saw actually in in a review that that some of the some of the studies have not substantiated that smoking is a risk factor although there in one of the studies that i that i review uh today for the ace inhibitor smoking was considered a risk factor um so so it's interesting it's sort of uh you know in some cases seems to be a risk factor in others uh it doesn't seem to be a risk factor i guess it depends on how advanced your lung disease associated with smoking is thank you so much nestor um another question was any particular guidelines on uh use of remdi severe other than watching the liver function test such as defer watching the gfr if less than 30 cc's a minute um what what are your recommendations in terms of um precautions when using remdi severe right to be completely honest i'm sorry i have to i have to read the the fda i just got it today and i i share with everybody what i haven't read but i promise for the next session i will i will read it in detail i just remember from the studies that that the the most salient feature was this increase in the lfts in three three to five percent of the patient both in the chinese and i think in in the gilead also in a news conference mentioned that that was the only so the important safety alert or safety uh issue that they that they notice in their in their large trial uh but i think we need to look at the data more carefully and i have to read the fda um guidance uh before before i can answer that question esther can i just clarify there were a couple questions just about the definition of do you mean the transaminases or the yes yeah i answered that on the chat but yes what they what they follow was basically just just lfts specifically transaminases and they notice that three percent of the patients in one of the studies are elevated and in fact there were a few patients in the in the faustian studies at the nih that were taken off the treatment because of lft's issues but it was a minority of patients thanks nestor thanks carla um there there's a number of questions i'm asking about um you know the increased cases in in mckinley county and san juan county parts of new mexico and particularly among the um uh native americans and in the navajo nation region and i just wanted to let folks know we are trying to get a talk for our covet echo which which meets on on fridays this friday um and we also have a couple questions regarding convalescent plasma and we do have a talk this friday though already um set up with liz rosenbaum from who's the medical director of italian she's going to be speaking on a convalescent plasma and how covet pos how you can encourage your patients who have recovered from uh their infection with covid and how they might be able to donate blood and how that might um work in terms of a treatment we're also trying to get a case um to present um around someone who's been successfully transfused with some convalescent plasma um just moving on to another question before i pass it back to carla should patients be admitted if they need oxygen or might there be a role in putting them on home oxygen first what do you think about that so this this question is for me or for marla i think it's for you nestor no actually i uh i mean i haven't uh worked in the kobe uh words here in the in the hospital with the you know the discharge part so so i think i cannot answer that that uh that question but i know for a fact that there's some patients that are requesting obscene therapy at home and they are being discharged with oxygen but i i really don't don't don't have an opinion on that but something i would ask michelle harkins uh and some of the other uh that are actually providing direct care to these patients thank you mister um i just wanted to go back to testing for a minute because there was a test specifically about the home testing um and the question is how good is the home nasal swab test and will we be getting it in new mexico and i don't know carissa if you can speak to that um so i don't know about the performance of the home nasal swab um i think that was a a kit that i believe was made available by uh lab core i believe but um i could be wrong i haven't not looked at the performance of that test but so so i don't have any specific data on that the cdc though does recommend on the website related to specimen collection that symptomatic patients can receive a nasal swab but asymptomatic patients should have a nasopharyngeal swab at this time likely because of the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab in asymptomatic patients that you know could perhaps have a lower amount of virus present so i think that's probably one limitation that we should keep in mind for alternative specimen types but i think there's more data that's emerging about specimen types that would be less invasive and potentially decrease the need for ppe and multiple manufacturers are continuing to evaluate those options thank you carissa marla did you have any comment on that i think um you know carissa mentioned i believe it's labcorp that has come up with this home testing kit um and it you know if you're a lab core customer um there's no reason that someone couldn't order that through labcorp um and have it sent to a new mexico uh resident but we're currently not offering that um through the state lab or any of our testing sites thank you very much um there's a question i haven't heard of myself but it's i've heard that there are three known strains of the virus abroad do we know if all three strains have been identified in the u.s nestor do you know anything about that no i know i've seen a lot of publications on the evolution of the virus and the way they are there are mutations in some areas of the bodies and different of the virus in different um papers from italy from from here from the us and and china but i haven't really seen any specifics to new mexico thank you i don't know carissa if you have any comment on that question as well maybe not all right um oh sorry i hadn't take myself off mute so i think um there are there are definitely studies that are looking at the phylogenetic changes in the virus to see if we can do mapping um and so what's really um being seen when we think about strains you know we we talk about strains of of the flu or other other viruses really this is uh one virus and these are small genetic differences that just help us to identify and map where the virus has been rather than any uh difference in so far there's not been any demonstration of difference in disease morbidity or mortality or severity or pathogenicity in the disease so really i think all we know and have seen with the strains is that it's just helping us to get some uh geographic and phylogenetic understanding of the virus rather than anything that has any significant clinical value great thank you very much so um we just have about five minutes left but one of our um our colleagues siri chan khalsa up in northern new mexico had a quick question about a patient-related question um and and we'll see if we can get some answers for you siri go ahead you can update yourself uh can you hear me yeah okay sorry i'm not on video i'm home with my three-month-old so um but i uh had a patient who came into clinic to follow up after being hospitalized for a non-stemi uh on the 22nd of april and when he was admitted he um he had a number of findings that were consistent with a possible covid19 infection including a chest x-ray that showed ground glass opacities he had elevated the dimer his creatinine was a little bit elevated and his 56 long history of tobacco use is obese asymptomatic from a covid19 perspective while he was impatient white cells went up a little bit he got a slight elevation in his alt um and they tested him for covid19 and it was negative and of course you know all of his findings could be explained by the fact that he was in there for a non-stemi and needed four stents placed um but i'm wondering now on an outpatient basis if there's any utility in testing him again for kobe 19 just in case it was a false negative he continues to be asymptomatic however from a respiratory perspective great thank you it's an excellent question mr would you like to address that no i think if the clinical suspicion is high enough um you know there is there is a place to to to consider testing uh and this is a patient that if we if we had readily available serologic testing if if she had uh actually copied in in you know a couple of weeks ago when she was in the hospital or whenever she was in the hospital it's a patient that in theory can be tested for igg and and if if anything should to have a positive ig demonstrating that that episode was in fact um related to kobe because there have been cardiovascular uh even st elevation and non non hd elevation associated with kovitz so if she had also the ground glass and other findings um you know though maybe explained by by the underlying disease i think this is one of those situations in which probably a serologic test would be useful um if you know we have no issues with the sensitivity specificity and availability of the testing it would be a patient that i would do more than anything not just to prove that that is immune or anything just to see if it's uh more likely than not that that she had uh she had kobe uh when she was in the hospital thank you nestor yeah that's a great um uh it's a great question and i think that that would also inform whether or not the contact tracing situation so from a public health standpoint is probably important as well and it is it is a situation at unm where we would consider using this or serologic testing great thank you guys very much you're welcome so we only just have a couple minutes left i just wanted to tell everybody that the cme for this session is in um is is in the chat box now so if you want cme please go to that uh fill out the survey we would love to hear feedback and also to know how to improve these sessions if you have comments and what other um anything else you'd like to tell us and as we mentioned a couple times but we have the the uh the echo on friday and we're going to be talking about convalescent plasma so that should be a really good good session and also there's a critical care session on uh thursday morning from eight to nine that michelle harkins is running where she has a case and a short didactic and they've been very really excellent and joanna i'm not sure if you know what the didactic is for that one that you can announce that as well um i'm not sure the topic i think um i'm not sure the topic but uh michelle harkins is is also having cases every week on the critical care echo as as we are on the covet echo and i just want to let everybody know we also have a first responder resiliency echo open to all all clinicians and that's on mondays from two to three from two to three p.m so that's just in in an hour from now but we we will send out the a reminder on the critical care echo and the topic thanks carla thank you and i just got a text saying that it's neurologic manifestations of of cognitive at this at the critical care echo so that should be very good so we're at the top of the hour and thank you everyone for joining and we will see you see you next week thank you nestor thank you marla and carissa and laura you\""
