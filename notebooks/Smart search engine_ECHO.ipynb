hello everybody i'm here hey nestor it's carla good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious disease office hours we're very excited to see everybody here today and welcome to those who've been before and welcome to any new participants as well just a couple of housekeeping announcement announcements before we get started um for those of you who are familiar with project echo we really like to our one of our goals is building community and so we really like to see people's faces so if you do not have if you have a camera and don't have it on we would love for you to turn it on and keep it on during the session if possible we would ask that people keep themselves muted unless they're called on by one of the facilitators we will try as always to answer all the questions that were submitted through the registration and we will also we would also love to hear your questions on the chat so if you have a question during this session please um enter it into the chat box and we'll try to get to those as well um a couple of other things we have a digital librarian who's amazing and and during this process uh during the entire session he'll be putting some links into the chat based on questions that come in so you can always look at the chat too to find more information because of many of you know there's been a lot of security issues with zinc with um zoom lately so we can't actually put hyperlinks in the chat anymore so if you want to go to one of those links you have to copy and paste them and put them into your own web browser and lastly our website is being updated all the time with videos of the sessions and other resources so please please go to that if you want more information okay so i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm going to do a couple of introductions and then i'll ask one question then and turn it over to joanna um i want to introduce our uh office hours with nester sosa who's our chief of uh the division of infectious diseases here at the university of new mexico and he is generously offered his to do this three times a week so we really appreciate it and he's been busy sort of on the front lines and has a lot of good information so nestor i'll have you introduce yourself in just a minute and just give us a little update on anything that you think is important for the group to know and i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and we work closely together she'll be helping to moderate the question question and answer section so nestor why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and please say a few words if you will sure thank you thank you very much carla and thank thank you everybody for one more time connecting and sending those uh excellent questions i think um really on the on the research front we we're starting to see um a couple of publications um a little bit you know debunking the the hope that we have with hydroxychloroquine there was a publication from brazil that actually showed uh increased toxicity when they use the the original molecule the chloroquine molecule especially cardiac toxicity and there is a pre-publication that is going to come out in the british medical journal of probably one of the first comparative trial of hydroxyl chloroquine versus control or placebo and it showed no benefit um and these were close to 180 181 subjects so so i think um we're probably going to be looking into other uh other uh products like rendezvous or maybe the convalescent plasma as some hope for for uh for a useful therapeutic intervention but i think soon we're going to have to be revising the recommendations and and protocols in many of the centers um here in the us uh in you know in view of these uh these results and then we you know continue to follow the very closely the the development of the literature and the scientific uh publications over thank you investor and i wanted to introduce one more person um i wanted to introduce you all to juanita barapa she's a medical director of medicaid here in new mexico and i just wanted to see if she had any announcements from medicaid or hsd that she would like to just share with us today juanita thank you oh hi good uh good afternoon everyone uh i want to thank uh practical and uh faculty you know assist us in learning subject together and medicaid we're trying to take advantage of uh other i shouldn't set advantage but we want to take a full cap capability that the federal government assistance to the state in terms of uh you know the waivers and uh the new way to do business via telehealth or telemedicine and telephone so um hsd and um medical assistant division working around the clock trying to keep up with all these uh blanket waivers to try to bring the uh the um the benefits to the state so i'd like to thank everyone you know hard work and also education to take care of our members thank you so much juanita so i'm going to just ask one question then i'll turn it over to joanna um nestor there's been a lot of questions over the last couple of weeks about masks and um one of the questions from today was does wearing a mask outside make sense and one you know there was a question last week uh last on monday that i don't think we got to that someone asked a very similar thing that these masks aren't masks that that protects you from viruses basically they're not homemade masks or cloth masks and so what does does it make sense what is the reason for wearing them right now yeah that's an excellent question and in fact to be honest at the beginning of the epidemic i didn't see any sense in the general public using mask but with the mounting evidence on especially on asymptomatic transmission or pre-symptomatic transmission it makes makes sense to use a mask more than anything to prevent youth infecting other people so it's actually because there are patients or or subjects that contract this infection and do not develop any symptoms but they can infect their their um co-workers or persons around them it makes sense to wear a mask because that contains to a certain degree the the respiratory droplets the saliva when you cough when you talk so it's more than anything to protect other people than to protect yourself because we know that a simple cloth mask or even a surgical mask is not 100 protective for you um for infection if there are aerosols in the air that contain the virus but on the other hand you are definitely limiting the spread of your respiratory secretions if you wear a mask in public so i think um it makes sense now to to to use that recommendation especially if you're going to be if you're going to go to the grocery store to the supermarket or to any place where you're going to be close to other people in order to protect them it's reasonable to wear a mask and we have seen this in in you know videos and and uh news from from from japan and china that they use it all the time even before the kobe my team was uh discover or prevalent so so now it really really makes sense on the current uh you know information that we have about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transition which is which is pretty um uh pretty significant i mean i just i just saw an article uh yesterday um and published in the new england journal about they actually tested over 200 pregnant females that went to the labor and delivery room and they found that 13 of them had asymptomatic viral shedding as opposed to one point something so it's seven times more frequent to have a young uh person treating the virus without even having symptoms uh than than symptoms so so asymptomatic transmission it's it's it's been appreciated more and more so that it makes sense just to wear a mask to protect others under those conditions thank you thank you nestor thanks carla this is joanna katzman here um i'm going to nestor if it's okay i'm gonna start with some treatment questions but i did want to let everybody know you might have seen the slide before the session and on the chat about the new um cdc covered 19 clinical call center it opened five days ago it's a 24 7 call center for clinicians and um health departments and a close colleague of mine is is manning it and she is referring clinicians actually to our echoes here um as well but she asked me to um let you you all know that this call center is for clinicians um and health departments if they have any urgent questions it i think it is being manned by physicians and advanced practice providers and they're giving cdc guidance and and particular questions so i think it's a really good um thing to know about if you have any urgent questions day and night and maybe to take a little load off of nestor on the pals call 24 7 too so the first question is um is ivermectin nester being explored for treatment after um some studies have shown um some in vitro studies have shown the inhibition of viral rna transcription there has been i know some studies on ivermectin right there is uh at least evidence in vitro that that hybrid mechanism also inhibits the virus there are actually a lot of of uh molecules being considered for clinical trials um i actually reviewed a paper in in journal that actually mentioned over 300 research protocols are being conducted at this moment in the united states and other countries looking for different interventions pharmacologic and otherwise intervention for copic night team i don't know if there's a specific protocol already for hybrid mechan but i wouldn't be surprised because there are many many molecules that have um either immunomodulator effect or direct antiviral that are being evaluated in different clinical trials either alone or in combination uh but but to my knowledge i i haven't really seen a protocol on either mechan um yet but i wouldn't be surprised to be honest thank you um and uh we might have uh touched on this last week but might you touch on it again your thoughts related to the uh timing of remdissevere and this other um immune modulating drug i'm i'm gonna not pronounce it right but uh t-o-l-i-c-i-z-u-m-a-b yeah the toss-illissum yes and and and you know because we we don't have uh well uh randomized control trials everything that i'm going to say sort of in analogy to what we know from other viral infections in general um you know this this viral infection and kobe 19 is not an exception it's actually pretty typical uh there is a component that the virus um that is it's it's the fault of the virus it's virus directed inflammation but then there's an uncontrolled immune response uh and and damaging immune response that also uh activates the coagulation cascade uh activate the cytokine storm so we have sort of uh you know two two phases to this disease that the viral and the immunologic i think for in general for antivirals to work they need to be used earlier so i wouldn't be surprised if most of the study points to our earlier rather than late uh efficacy for these drugs so if you use a antiviral probably late in the second week when the patient is already in icu it's probably going to be very hard to show efficacy uh and so so in general i think and this is true with influenza the earlier you use the antiviral the the better uh chance the patient have to to to have a good recovery or or or or do not advance to more severe disease on the other hand there are some drugs that have been or that i have that they are being considered in the in the more advanced patients and toscilisumati is an example because toscilicium it's a it's a it's an inhibitor of il-6 one of the cytokines that are elevated uh in the cytokine storm that this patient experienced so i think some of those immune modulators may be more useful in a sub-population of patients that actually have this severe inflammatory state um on the other hand there's there's mounting evidence that probably early anti-population something like low molecular weight heparin prophylactically maybe it may be useful in hospitalized patients so so you know we are learning a lot but i think if anything antivirals and including convalescent plasma are going to be useful if anything at the beginning early in the disease uh more than really late um and and some others may maybe still have some usefulness late but it will be mostly in the immune modulator uh or trying to quiet down the immune system at the end to prevent the excess inflammation excess correlation etc thanks mister i think you answered a couple of the questions under the treatment someone else i that dr urbina from akama asked kind of how would you suggest using low resource how would you suggest low resource institutions or kind of maybe critical access hospitals modulate this cytokine storm to prevent this moderate to severe disease but i think you answered that you gave a lot of kind of ideas in that in that sense um let me ask you one more question then i'll turn it over to carla is there any proof that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be gifted be given has that been disproven nestor right there is no evidence one way or the other at the beginning there was a general sort of a blanket recommendation from wa show and i think an official in france uh who actually a health official in france france who said that they were somewhat contra indicated um but i haven't seen any solid evidence in favor or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs what i say all the time if you use it for just fever control it's probably better to use a safer drug like like acetaminophen or paracetamol paracetamol at this point because we have no evidence of efficacy or or toxicity um and and there are some uh studies that that the non-steroidal may increase the number of receptors the h2 receptor so the i think until we have solid evidence i would say if you if you have a fever and you're at home with the kovid just take acetaminophen if you need to take anything uh for the fever um as opposed to to nonsteroidal until we really learn with more solid evidence if they are uh deleterious or or or if they help in any way thank you nestor before we move away from the treatment questions do you um can you just give an update about what uh clinical trials are going on at unm sure yeah we have several of them uh we have a uh one of the earliest trials that we started was the hydroxychromoquin combined with acetomycin right after we saw the the study from the french and the endorsement of the fda for for this combination we started an open label trial for patients and and we have been using hydroxychromic when combined with acetomycin in some of the patients that are in icu this is an open label study so we're probably not going to learn a lot from it i mean we have the some patients that did not use that combination so we will have at least historical controls uh but as i said it's just a it's an open label study mostly um directed towards allowing us access to the drugs um but now that we are sort of accumulating evidence of probably the the inefficacy or or or lack of efficacy of uh hydroxychloroquine and in fact some issues about toxicity because there's a carrier toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin also has the same uh problem with the prolongation of the qtc the the qtc segment in the ekg which is associated with some uh really dangerous ventricular arrhythmias so so we're probably going to move away from those drugs and then we are actually discussing them on each other about that that trial there's also uh we are in the planning stages of using convalescent plasma which is the other tool and we in fact we have we are applying to four different protocols one protocol in prophylaxis let's say a person like a family member close family member of a copy patient the question is can can that person receive plasma and prevent the disease from from uh from establishing itself so there's a there's a pulse exposure prophylaxis and also for a healthcare worker exposed so we have we are working on on starting that trial for possible exposure prophylaxis there's another trial for ambulatory patients patients that that are test positive but they are um not sick enough to be hospitalized can we give them convalescent plasma uh to prevent hospitalization and then there are two other trials for for uh mildly ill and and severely ill patients um looking at convalescent plasma there are a couple of um of sort of basic science studies that we are planning also to see the mutation rate of the virus to see the immune response of the virus the group from global health are actually planning uh these are more uh biological and immunological studies than than therapeutic studies so we have you know quite a few uh clinical trials which are about to start are in the process of carrying getting irb approval uh some of the them are local trials others are multi-center so we're participating with with tough university and uh and and um and also other universities to to develop these these multi-center uh trials thank you so much so i'm going to ask a couple questions about testing and screening um one of the questions from uh from somebody ackman also somebody in clovis given results in new england journal of medicine regarding pregnant patients should all pregnant and patients be screened for cobit 19. yeah i think this is a really powerful story uh uh obviously the the right answer you have to know what's going on in your community you're not gonna test uh all pregnant females if there's no community outbreak in in your area but if you're in an area where there is like you know widespread community transmission um it's probably based on these evidence it's probably a good idea to test in order to protect yourself i mean your your team your healthcare workers and and also know that that the that the mother is it's a copy positive and takes some actions regarding the the newborn also so i think it does makes make some sense uh but we have to see the the prevalence of the disease in the community the availability of resources the the including the tests the swaps to make up you know a more precise decision regarding regarding this uh this strategy sorry about that thank you nestor um do you i know that our department of health colleagues aren't on today but do you can you go over the latest criteria in new mexico for testing you you want me to go over yeah no i'm just saying i don't marla's not on today but if you if you can go over that that would be great yeah i think uh the the most uh like important criteria is symptomatic patient patients who have symptoms suggestive of covet including some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia or loss of sense of taste may trigger the need for the test they have also increased the number of or or increased the indication to certain situations where there's a congregation of people like uh in prisons jail nursing homes you can do testing even in asymptomatic patients those are the general guidelines um obviously the department of health um when they're doing an investigation of an outbreak they they also have some um you know flexibility in doing the test to the contacts and people around them but but it's really symptomatic patients and um in places where there is congregation of people like like nursing home jails and other and other instances where there's there's a lot of people living together thank you very much and a couple of other i know that i'm not sure if you know the answer to this but um one of the questions from uh albuquerque as well as is there any rapid testing in new mexico and i know we talked about this a little bit on monday and we don't have carissa un unfortunately on the line but if you if you want to speak to that nester yeah i can tell you what i know i mean i've been in so many zooms meetings at different levels that i have some information obviously not final thing but i know the the a person from the state lab commented that the state was receiving 30 able machines these are the 15 minutes uh rapid testing machines and they're going to distribute it mostly to like rural hospitals or areas where they don't have ready access to to testing so that was really good news they still don't have enough of the reagents or the cartridges that this machine use but they're going to receive more in the next few days if they haven't received it so so yes we're going to have some of this rapid testing obviously only 30 so far but 30 is better than zero so we're going to have some places especially in the highly affected areas that are going to have access to to this test i know also that we at unmh probably will get uh cartridges for the gene expert which is which is a relatively rapid test it's not like 15 minutes but it gives you an answer in less than less than an hour uh so we may be able to have that test available and that is important because we have seen cases for instance patients who come and need like emerging surgery or delivery or they're going to deliver a baby or they need some acute intervention and they may have symptoms objective for kobe they may have you know a little bit of cough or fever and but they they have another medical problem like an acute mi or they need emerging appendectomy and and it's good to to have a test so you can rapidly triage those patients okay they have some respiratory system but they're called negative so you can go ahead and do the procedure and don't waste uh you know uh ppe etc so i think there's a place and we are gonna get the rapid test and before and before i get asked there's also uh in development the the serologic test and they said that in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks uh we're gonna have a serologic test to detect igg i don't know how i mean at the beginning they're gonna probably have a learning curve and and they're going to be increasing their capacity initially will be restricted somehow um as it happened with this pcr base test at the beginning that it was available but very limited but i think in a matter of several weeks we'll probably be able to have this or logic test also more readily available across across the state which is good news uh because when the when the search passes we really want to know how many people what percentage of the population was affected and it's going to be important for like returning back to work see if you're if you have been exposed or not and other interventions that i think serological tests may have some useful usefulness thank you nestor and just as a reminder to those everyone next monday david grenache who's leading the um serologic testing at tricor is going to be on so he can give us an update about where we're at with zerologic testing thank you over to you joanna thank you so much carla i wanted to let you know also um that uh uh elizabeth uh rosenbaum who uh runs uh the former united blood services now by talent is uh is willing to come on and talk about uh the serology and um the you know plot plasma um ex you know plasma exchange um nester that probably in the next week or two so that would be a help as well um i i wanted to know if um uh diane gassin or teresa chavez was on the line if they wanted to unmute and ask their question about um about immunity after being infected are you are are you are either of you on the line diane or teresa okay um and i wondered if peggy spencer was on the line dr spencer okay peggy sorry hey peggy hey there you are i saw you earlier good to see you um do you want to ask your you had a couple of really good questions everyone's questions are great i wanted to see if you might want to answer your questions directly i don't remember what they were um they were about the um the advising patients to um you know if they are symptomatic at home covet positive getting in a prone position would you like to ask oh yeah oh yeah um because i'd heard about proning being used in the hospital so i was just wondering about advising people at home whether that's a good idea for them at home to keep if that's if there's any evidence that that helps it keep it from progressing yeah that's a great question and i haven't seen any publication for for data at home but i have been in several um presentations where experts icu experts from especially from the east coast are are uh you know relating that patients especially in the icu when they are placed on the prone position they improve their oxygenation and it has to do with with several factors with the with the blood flow within the lungs at the location of the the most affected areas and the lungs of brony seems to be helping i saw also and this was just a slide in one of the experts that actually mentioned that they were doing voluntary prone in the in the emergency department and in the in the general awards because of the same reason because we have used prone in before in icus and intubated patient but they are suggesting that there's probably uh also benefit of doing it outside icu i guess like in in the emergency room or general wars i haven't seen anything at home for that it would be interesting to to do a study and see because it's relatively simple i mean you can do it with a pulse oximeter and measure if the oxygenation improves but i have seen that i haven't seen any literature just as i said expert opinion part of presentations uh but i haven't seen any written like you know like a recommendation to actually implement prone on on patient but it's really a good question and i think it's not difficult to answer that question because you can you can do a before and after with with the pulse oximeter and see if actually patients improve by changing the position voluntarily thank you so much dr spencer um dr sosa i i'm wondering if you might be able to address this a little bit one of uh our our colleagues dr strumminger sent us a um just uh just some email uh literature this morning about delaying um putting someone on a ventilator because it might not be as useful as we had once thought um can you can you kind of uh critique that and kind of say what you think about that yeah again i want to say the disclaimer that i'm not an icu person and this is not my my strength but i have seen uh the comments going back and forth in the icu community um some people claim that that we're probably uh intubating people too early and and that actually ventilatory support may be damaging for the lungs in some cases um but i have seen the other the other comment also because if you delay intubation and you have to do it on an emergency basis because the patient is really short of breath they can even go into cardiac arrest and be a more difficult integration so so i i mean i i'm not going to say in i'm going to not going to be on one side or the other i think we need to look at the evidence and actually ask the experts from icu what is the latest on that on that but i know it's a concern uh and it's a difficult decision because when you have a patient that it's you know having trouble breathing and you're actually uh agonizing over should i intubate him and it's every day in all hospitals uh that decision is made and it's a difficult one because you know that that the mortality once they're intubated it's very high in some in some publications 50 others have seen up to 80 percent mortality once they they developed the ards the cytokine storm and go into a into a mechanical support so i think the jury is still out is the ventilator you know more makes more harm than good um it's really difficult to tell at this stage thank you great thank you i wanted to see if um if lisa cope is on if she would like to ask her question it came through the chat but i just wanted just to give a little bit more context and explain the question a little bit more lisa if you cannot meet yourself okay yes yeah i know but at least is one of the uh administrators here but uh my name is rajeev patel i'm a pulmonary intensivist at uh rehoboth hospital and gallup and we have a 54 year old uh woman who is chronic dialysis who's now trached after spending i think 18 days um uh with an endotracheal tube and she's doing actually quite well minimal event support but uh the quest so her third swab was negative we did a confirmatory uh after 24-hour interval that came back positive so i was gonna check a fifth uh after one week but i'm just kind of making that up um and i i don't know what other people are doing when you've got a negative and the confirmatory turns positive can you speak to that yes yeah that's very difficult and let me just give sort of a more general perspective i mean what we are measuring with this pcr it's rna it's the presence of rna in the in the respiratory secretion not actually unfortunately we don't have a sensitive enough tool to to measure infecting virus we're just measuring a section of the virus the rna and we know for instance if we use the analogy of tuberculosis people who are treated and no longer infections may still have dna of the of the bacilli for weeks or months in the respiratory secretions and that doesn't mean that they transmit uh so something similar may be happening with this virus we are detecting intermittently especially in patients that have had like a a really complicated course and we've seen this in the literature that they persist positive or they are intermittently positive do that means that they are transmitting the disease because they have uh the presence of the virus in their i mean the presence of the rna of the virus we do not know the there is a german study in which they actually tried to culture the virus they use cells to culture the virus and they were not able to culture any virus if there were less than 10 to the six so one million copies of rna after below that threshold they were not able to co to culture in cells the virus so so we know that that that rna is probably much more sensitive uh to detect rna than to detect infectious virus so so it's it's a difficult question in that case if the patient is going home um i wouldn't have any problem you know sending the person home but if it is with a tracheostomy it's going to like like a skill nor facility then you you really have to follow the cdc recommendation of having two consecutive uh negative uh rnas but but i still i don't think we're do we are sure that that is necessary and we'll probably learn more when we do you know other epidemiological studies with these patients who are discharged they actually still infection my feeling is that once the patient has you know neutralizing antibodies and and are clinically improving and are not coughing on a fever even if they have rna in their respiratory secretion they're probably not as infectious as they were in the first five days based on the data that we know from from some of the cruise ships and that they have done cultures and and also pcr and this german study that i mentioned um that that was also very well designed although it was really small but very well designed in which they were not able to culture buyers after certain days of disease progression thank you nestor and an important question just came through the chat was sort of related to this can you review which patient should have or might need a confirmatory testing or sequential testing can you talk a little bit about that yeah i think the the main indication if the person is not going to be discharged home but it's going to a to a facility where there is more you know more people living together um that that some centers are are asking for a negative actually two consecutive negative uh tests separated by 24 hours if the patient or the person is going to go home and can be isolated at home i think that there's no need for him to be negative as long as he's following the isolation the home isolation rules and and preventing their relatives to be being exposed to the buyers so i think that's that's uh the the the i think the general rule that they are they are asking for that if they're going to be transferred to another facility or to a rehab or or some skill nor facility that they are negative but otherwise otherwise uh if they're going to go home they can go home because we are sending people with positive copied home if they don't have any symptoms so that's that's essentially the the issue here thank you and you know i think that a little bit of the confusion is about the the use of the word confirmatory because it sounds like you have one test and then you have a confirmation test but but you're just talking about the one pcr test correct correct yeah they're the same test done twice it's just because of the intermittency of the positive test that's what they they ask for two consecutive i mean probably if you do three maybe the third is positive but the rule says two if you have two negative you're you're good to go um with the information that we have and follow in cdc recommendation but again you know we're probably overdoing it we probably you know in a patient who's 21 28 days into their illness and they have clear the secretion clear the x-ray they are a fever they're not coughing you know the chances that they are transmitting it's small not zero but probably small from what we have seen in this in the published story so far thank you nestor and i'm going to ask a couple of questions about immunity and transmission there was a question that came through the chat about if a mom has copied 19 is she can she breastfeed her baby yeah i think uh uh you know breastfeeding is okay uh the problem is i mean there's no evidence of transmission through through the milk the problem is also also the the close proximity of the baby to the mother so there's there's it's not just the breastfeeding itself the the milk itself as a as a way to transmit is the the proximity of the mother to the child that puts a risk to this to this baby so it's really a difficult difficult uh question to answer in the in the practical sense thank you and i know that um there's not a clear answer to this yet but can you just talk about what we know about people who are and how what their immunity is like after their if people are immune after they get infected right yeah that's a that's a great question you're right we don't have a definitive answer and i'm gonna just mention several things we know uh we have some experience with before i mean we have the endemic coronavirus and we have stars and mirrors what we know from the from the old coronaviruses from the endemic coronavirus that are associated with common cold people do develop immunity but the immunity doesn't last too long it lasts you know for months maybe a couple of years and then it goes down because we know that these coronaviruses actually come back every few years and they actually alternate there's one coronavirus circulating and the others are suppressed then the following year you have another coronavirus and so on and so forth so we know that coronavirus in general induces immunity when when when a person is infected we know that there's immunity also to stars and tumors in there are patients who had sars in way in the in you know 20 years ago and they had some detectable immunity so if this virus is going to behave the same we are going to have some degree of immunity regarding kobe 19 specifically you know we know we don't know too much about it but we know that there are patients who recover that have neutralizing antibodies because that's actually the marker that we're using or one of the markers that we're using to to uh to select convalescent plasma to use as treatment that the person have titles of neutralizing antibodies neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent cells in the laboratory from being infected there are there are sort of protective antibodies um because they attack the virus they attach to to a very important part of the virus which is a spike protein and prevent the virus from entering the cell so it is safe to assume that is if a person recovers and develops this neutralizing antibodies that person should be protected well we don't know really it's it's how long those those um protective antibodies are gonna last it's gonna be you know six months a year two years we do not know because you know this virus is only four or five months old um so we don't really know what the effect on the on the immune system and the same goes for the vaccine if a successful vaccine is developed we don't know if we're going to have to use it every couple of years every year like influenza because we don't really know what the need is going to be and there's also the possibility of some uh mutation and evolution of the virus the virus under the pressure of of the immune system may have uh mutations in their spike protein and other important parts of the viral may change over time when they're circulating in you know in thousands and thousands of human beings there may be some changes in the virus and we may need to reformulate the vaccine or people may need to have a different um or may have a second infection at some point in the in the in the future if the virus mutates a lot so those are all you know interesting things but we still don't know the definitive answer for most of those of those questions and that is something that that uh you know makes public health uh officials worry because we can have you know circulation of disaster for a longer period of time we have second wave we may need a uh reformulation of accidents when they are available etc so it's it's it's tough i mean the future is too complicated thank you um this is joanna here um i was wondering if octavia had a chat question and i'm wondering if she's on the line if she might be able to unmute for us and ask um her question yes i'm here a physician approached me this morning we definitely are for those patients under investigation and um covet 19 patients using the proper ppe he he said recently acog released something that says that we should wear the ppe and n95s for all second stage i looked on the site i could not find anything for everyone because of the new study out saying that so many people walk around asymptomatic and could actually have it and because second stage they're pushing the amount of aerosols in the air so i was wondering if anybody else heard anything no i haven't heard about that but i can tell you what we are doing here in um unm and and and i agree i mean there is there are uh some evidence that this virus can survive in the air we know that there are experiments in which they have they have actually taken samples from the air of in rooms of patients and they are able to find the virus there we know that there are some procedures that generate aerosols um like intubation cpr and relationship and other natural which in theory can contain the virus but then again the the measures that we recommend um because the main transmission mode is actually through droplets so to large droplet or direct contact with patients um most of the most of the contacts with patients are done with just contact precautions and and droplet precautions you don't need to use the n95 in all the situations when you are near one of these patients unless unless the patient is um you know a mechanical ventilation or they have they are going to undergo a procedure that generates aerosols because we know although in theory uh there could be uh you know viral particles in the air the chances and and the practical chances are are really small and and we gather these from from you know for instance uh the healthcare workers mo a lot of the haircut workers that get infected is because they're not using any ppe or or they didn't put a mask on the patient or actually they got in the community not necessarily because they were using contact precautions um so that's what the recommendation the general use of contact precaution and there's also another reality and it's the limited amount of n95 mass uh so you have to use it when really need it if you have a limited amount it's just a rational thing to do to use and only when when you are at high risk of being exposed to aerosol as opposed to you know in all contacts with patients that you put into you that you need so are you putting not just general ma mass on all patients during second stage um yeah i don't know if you can clarify what do you mean by second second stage when and when it's time to deliver because that's when we get all the pushing and grunting and all the interesting things we do i haven't been to the labor and delivery i will defer that question to maybe the infection control colleagues um because i i don't know what what type of pp they're using inside the the labor and delivery room here at unm uh yeah and i don't mean those that's tested positive or under suspicion i see allen waving but here if you can answer i'm listening i've also a physician a retired physician uh i have not found a publication a medical publication but i can tell you that it is now a common practice in all obstetrical units along the east coast in all women active in active second stage labor or if coughing are currently having a routine surgical mass placed on them okay uh no as to my knowledge no one's putting n95 on patients the last time that was recommended was by dr scars at the very start of this and that's now been retracted n95s are reserved for individuals who are in situations where there's definite um you know you're working on a definite positive we're just too short of 95's of importance there is an article that showed up in archives internal medicine a letter from april the 8th i believe that has subsequently been debunked that was a small chinese study suggesting that there was no significant difference between folks wearing a mask and coughing that study has been debunked because there was no negative control what they did in that case is they put out small containers of viral transport media they had patients cough as a positive control they found roughly uh 10 to the third log base 10 to the third to 10 to the fourth number of viruses from just open coughing these were active covenant patients four of them and they put on a mask and they had them cough and surprisingly they had very little difference in the number of organisms found what that ultimately proved they did not do a negative control what that proved is that after you cough there are a lot of particles that continue to stay in the atmosphere so without a negative control that that study failed but the general understanding is that a routine surgical mask does significantly decrease the number of virus particles that can transmit out especially in large droplet it's not going to stop things that are smaller than 5 microns we don't believe that most of the viruses coming out of individuals as they cough are that small so definitely i think the strong recommendation currently is that routine surgical mass either procedure type or tie type should be placed on women as they move into active labor and begin breathing heavily okay that's the current recommendation that i've seen that's the current practice thank thanks dr caro thank you and thank you octavia can't pronounce it thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much um dr sosa i'm going to move on to one more question and give it back to carla if a person is exposed to someone with uh who's covet positive when when might you test that person if they become sick when might you test that person or might you not test that person how long would it take uh for a test to become positive in general the first i mean it depends on the strategy are you using uh if the person is asymptomatic and it's not within one of the recommended protocols you don't have to test them but you have to instruct the patient to uh to to enter a quarantine of 14 days to prevent in case they develop the disease to transmit it to others usually the incubation period for this disease is around five days and we know that probably 48 hours before the symptoms are present patients uh start to to uh to disseminate or may disseminate the virus so you know the testing it's it's indicated really when they develop symptoms most of the time so but but we know from from studies that were done especially with the cruise ships affected um that there were people who excreted the virus two days before they actually developed symptoms and we know now for more from more recent studies that there are there are patients who develop who do not develop symptoms they're actually uh pcr positive and as i said with the study with the pregnant females that was a proportion of seven to one so seven um to one more frequent uh asymptomatic shedding than actually symptomatic setting in those in those uh labor and delivery uh patients or patients at the end of the of the of pregnancy so so there's definitely a lot of asymptomatic excretions but the moment for testing is when you develop symptoms based on the on the current recommendation unless there's another um you know factor that makes you tested earlier if the person is in a nursing home or or within another uh situation when there's a lot of people in the same physical space thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually ask one of my dear colleagues robert gish to unmute himself and ask the question about iga all right thanks these echo sessions have been fantastic nestor carla the rest of your team i really appreciate being involved that i shaved today so i could turn on my video just so you know i was off before um i've been very interested in the antibodies uh nestor and the rest of the team here about this whole issue about protection immune status neutralizing antibodies etc i keep reading more information at iga as a secretory antibody for gi and lung may be absolutely critical and are we testing for iga what proof do we have that iga may be protective should all the new tests come out including abbott came out with a test today for covid hiv hepatitis b hepatitis c that was released and covered on the lay press today anyway so iga is the main question thank you yeah unfortunately robert i haven't i haven't seen anything there's a good story and i'm trying to remember uh where was it published out of china in which they and i think the title is like immune reaction or immune uh uh response to copy 19 in which they detail um the different antibodies that are produced obviously secretory iga should be key to decreased uh infectivity and transmission but i haven't seen any any anything specific about that nor have i seen any any uh tests that involve iga most of them that i've seen are igg rgm combination not actually iga so it would be really interesting to see if there any but i haven't seen any i'm going to actually look into into that and review that article from the chinese to see if they actually measure i think they mentioned something about idea but i'm i'm not sure because i don't remember out of the top of my head the details of the of the measurement uh quest is going to have a soft roll out of an antibody test and i've asked them or advised them to add iga to that panel so expect here's something from quests in the next 48 to 72 hours great thank you to both of you um i just wanted to to let everybody know that the cme link for the session is now in the chat box again you have to copy it and paste it into your own web browser but it's it's sometimes hard to see because it gets lost in all the questions but um it came in there from elena martinez so you can take a look at that and i'll ask another question mr um there was a couple more questions well actually i'm going to ask a sort of big picture question which i know you don't know the answer to but you can at least give us your opinion there are several um there are several questions just about when we anticipate our peak in cases in new mexico and also a question about if you know of any plans for new mexico to join other states for development of sort of a reopening plan after the shut this shutdown you're right i don't know the answers to this question no just kidding i'm going to give you my opinion no actually uh yeah i've seen a couple of models there's a model that have been developed by uh by the um by a group that is actually advising the governor and and you know this mother had been moving and they they they seem to be expecting a peak in the middle of may that's what i heard and there are different type of peaks depending on what intervention that what measures are are um are taken or sustained until until that point and and also the the same modeling includes different predictions regarding beds icu beds and ventilators so it's really complicated uh but at least we know that that that uh you know in in some instances the people will be you know in some of the models i've seen late april and they go all the way to middle of may and then hopefully a descent um into june um i i don't know the answer to the to the second question definitely not thank you nestor and i i this is another hard question i i think you went over testing already but uh marianne spencer was wanting to know is there any testing of healthcare workers who are asymptomatic no we're not we're not routinely testing at least here at unmh uh asymptomatic persons if they have been exposed and and exposed meaning a close contact so somebody examine a patient or spend more than a few minutes with the patient without the appropriate ppe and then we know that that person has been exposed then they go into quarantine and they have some close follow-up of symptoms but not routine testing as far as i know and until this this this um this point great thank you and one other testing question that came through we're still hearing that um around the country even symptomatic people can't get tested is that a problem here in new mexico uh you know that i don't know i i mean it's not it's not an issue here for us at the university hospital we we have been increasing and tricore has been really increasing their capacity to the point and now we get an answer in less than 24 hours sometimes even you know half a day uh we can get an answer and a and if it's uh you know recommended by one of the physicians based on the symptoms that the patient is tested so but i i cannot speak for the rest of the of the state which i know it's there are different conditions in different areas of of the state yeah i mean i know from just from from i'm talking to colleagues that the availability is is very good for testing in new mexico as far as i know and i don't know if there's anyone on the line that's having trouble getting tested getting tests but but there there are a lot of different places where people can actually get tested at this point so joanne i'm going to turn it back over to you for the last couple of questions sure um what i might just add is that i'm gonna refer people back again to the new mexico department of health covid um website and actually the state yesterday just put out a really nice interactive map that actually shows the testing sites by county as well so there's a link from health and human human services division back to department of health so there's the department of health really has a nice interactive map that you can get to about test sites and they also doing the um calls like it was a call today from the hospital association and they went over state statistics great thing thanks octavia um fantastic um i wanted to ask um uh nestor about um just in general possibly unm university of new mexico but in general um the visitor guidelines uh we're hearing a lot just nationally but also locally um what the visitor guidelines are or perhaps the the kind of strictness of um kind of no visitors being allowed can you might might be able to go over that as as far as you know no i'm sorry johanna i'm not familiar with the visitor that have been implemented by infectious control with the hospital leadership and i haven't really paid attention unfortunately i've been so busy with the you know all the other stuff that i i don't i've see i've seen very few visitors but i would wouldn't be qualified to answer that question to be honest what i can do is i can take this question and and we can ask it on friday at our covet echo um where we'll have um either megan brett or another doctor striker another hospital epidemiologist and there were a lot of good questions related to ventilators today and i want to let our participants know we also have a critical care echo every thursday from eight to nine in the morning and michelle harkins uh leads that echo and so um for those questions too those might be uh directed towards michelle and critical care questions as well i might ask one more question and james urbina from acoma wants to know about different um supplements like uh um tumeric and cucumber um and how they're being used in terms of investigational studies in terms of um il-6 suppression and immune modulation have you heard anything nestor about using some supplements and in terms of um immune suppression no unfortunately i haven't the the only thing that i have seen because i've seen many protocols from different places both in europe and here are the inclusion of of for instance vitamin c uh they're people just empirically using uh high doses vitamin c i have seen also the inclusion of zinc supplementation in the diet because we know that zinc has some uh utility in in common cold in other respiratory viruses i have seen the use of statins interestingly enough uh statins as you know has some anti-inflammatory rheologic properties and and so there there are researchers and and even a clinician using statins or maintaining statins on their on their patients as a way to decrease inflammation but i haven't seen anything on on turmeric or or or that those specific supplements as an anti-inflammatory uh but i've seen a lot a lot of things been used obviously without much support but but people are are sort of trying or testing their different uh different uh things that that you know to a certain point makes sense but but nestor but but zinc and vitamin c so some maybe some um water-soluble vitamins that are antioxidants perhaps right nestor any last minute um we have about two minutes to the top of the hour any closing statements i think the most important thing and actually want to do sort of a pitch in favor of the convalescent plasma because there are a lot of providers here at some point we're going to need um convalescent plasma to to to treat some of the patients when we're doing the clinical studies either prophylactic or therapeutic so if if if you can talk into your positive patient those who are taking care of calling patients to encourage them or their relatives that are positive to approach when the when the moment is right to approach uh you know the blood banks or the places where they donate blood and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma we would be great i hope we're probably going to have like a media advertisement to disregard but i think you know a patient to provide or provided to patient uh recommendation or suggestion is so powerful so so i would definitely encourage if if you if you are treating patients with kobe that that are uh you know minimally symptomatic or doing well at home if you can ask them at some point when when vitalan and the red cross are ready to receive them which is going to be very soon to actually to actually do it because we're going to need a lot of convalescent plasma um and and that would be that would be you know a good a good um thing to do to help the patients thank you so much nestor we're right at the top of the hour so thanks again everyone for joining um we just as a reminder the cme link is in this uh is in the chat box and multiple times now if you can go in there and copy it and um joanna mentioned our other echoes but we do have four out of the five days of the week have covered related echoes and you can learn you can find out more about them on our website into the code 19 page so thank you so much everyone for joining and we will see you hopefully soon joanne dr cassman yes check your email uh the society for wgyn hospitalist has put out a protocol uh strongly recommending uh masking for patients in active labor whether uh coveted positive or coveted unknown all so take a look at your email okay sure thanks you</td>\n",

       "0  okay look at your list no it's dinner i'm actually on page 29 of 35 previously we are going off of this now so i need to get rid of the rest some of it don't freak out um yes um hello everybody i'm here hey nestor it's carla good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious disease office hours we're very excited to see everybody here today and welcome to those who've been before and welcome to any new participants as well just a couple of housekeeping announcement announcements before we get started um for those of you who are familiar with project echo we really like to our one of our goals is building community and so we really like to see people's faces so if you do not have if you have a camera and don't have it on we would love for you to turn it on and keep it on during the session if possible we would ask that people keep themselves muted unless they're called on by one of the facilitators we will try as always to answer all the questions that were submitted through the registration and we will also we would also love to hear your questions on the chat so if you have a question during this session please um enter it into the chat box and we'll try to get to those as well um a couple of other things we have a digital librarian who's amazing and and during this process uh during the entire session he'll be putting some links into the chat based on questions that come in so you can always look at the chat too to find more information because of many of you know there's been a lot of security issues with zinc with um zoom lately so we can't actually put hyperlinks in the chat anymore so if you want to go to one of those links you have to copy and paste them and put them into your own web browser and lastly our website is being updated all the time with videos of the sessions and other resources so please please go to that if you want more information okay so i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm going to do a couple of introductions and then i'll ask one question then and turn it over to joanna um i want to introduce our uh office hours with nester sosa who's our chief of uh the division of infectious diseases here at the university of new mexico and he is generously offered his to do this three times a week so we really appreciate it and he's been busy sort of on the front lines and has a lot of good information so nestor i'll have you introduce yourself in just a minute and just give us a little update on anything that you think is important for the group to know and i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and we work closely together she'll be helping to moderate the question question and answer section so nestor why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and please say a few words if you will sure thank you thank you very much carla and thank thank you everybody for one more time connecting and sending those uh excellent questions i think um really on the on the research front we we're starting to see um a couple of publications um a little bit you know debunking the the hope that we have with hydroxychloroquine there was a publication from brazil that actually showed uh increased toxicity when they use the the original molecule the chloroquine molecule especially cardiac toxicity and there is a pre-publication that is going to come out in the british medical journal of probably one of the first comparative trial of hydroxyl chloroquine versus control or placebo and it showed no benefit um and these were close to 180 181 subjects so so i think um we're probably going to be looking into other uh other uh products like rendezvous or maybe the convalescent plasma as some hope for for uh for a useful therapeutic intervention but i think soon we're going to have to be revising the recommendations and and protocols in many of the centers um here in the us uh in you know in view of these uh these results and then we you know continue to follow the very closely the the development of the literature and the scientific uh publications over thank you investor and i wanted to introduce one more person um i wanted to introduce you all to juanita barapa she's a medical director of medicaid here in new mexico and i just wanted to see if she had any announcements from medicaid or hsd that she would like to just share with us today juanita thank you oh hi good uh good afternoon everyone uh i want to thank uh practical and uh faculty you know assist us in learning subject together and medicaid we're trying to take advantage of uh other i shouldn't set advantage but we want to take a full cap capability that the federal government assistance to the state in terms of uh you know the waivers and uh the new way to do business via telehealth or telemedicine and telephone so um hsd and um medical assistant division working around the clock trying to keep up with all these uh blanket waivers to try to bring the uh the um the benefits to the state so i'd like to thank everyone you know hard work and also education to take care of our members thank you so much juanita so i'm going to just ask one question then i'll turn it over to joanna um nestor there's been a lot of questions over the last couple of weeks about masks and um one of the questions from today was does wearing a mask outside make sense and one you know there was a question last week uh last on monday that i don't think we got to that someone asked a very similar thing that these masks aren't masks that that protects you from viruses basically they're not homemade masks or cloth masks and so what does does it make sense what is the reason for wearing them right now yeah that's an excellent question and in fact to be honest at the beginning of the epidemic i didn't see any sense in the general public using mask but with the mounting evidence on especially on asymptomatic transmission or pre-symptomatic transmission it makes makes sense to use a mask more than anything to prevent youth infecting other people so it's actually because there are patients or or subjects that contract this infection and do not develop any symptoms but they can infect their their um co-workers or persons around them it makes sense to wear a mask because that contains to a certain degree the the respiratory droplets the saliva when you cough when you talk so it's more than anything to protect other people than to protect yourself because we know that a simple cloth mask or even a surgical mask is not 100 protective for you um for infection if there are aerosols in the air that contain the virus but on the other hand you are definitely limiting the spread of your respiratory secretions if you wear a mask in public so i think um it makes sense now to to to use that recommendation especially if you're going to be if you're going to go to the grocery store to the supermarket or to any place where you're going to be close to other people in order to protect them it's reasonable to wear a mask and we have seen this in in you know videos and and uh news from from from japan and china that they use it all the time even before the kobe my team was uh discover or prevalent so so now it really really makes sense on the current uh you know information that we have about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transition which is which is pretty um uh pretty significant i mean i just i just saw an article uh yesterday um and published in the new england journal about they actually tested over 200 pregnant females that went to the labor and delivery room and they found that 13 of them had asymptomatic viral shedding as opposed to one point something so it's seven times more frequent to have a young uh person treating the virus without even having symptoms uh than than symptoms so so asymptomatic transmission it's it's it's been appreciated more and more so that it makes sense just to wear a mask to protect others under those conditions thank you thank you nestor thanks carla this is joanna katzman here um i'm going to nestor if it's okay i'm gonna start with some treatment questions but i did want to let everybody know you might have seen the slide before the session and on the chat about the new um cdc covered 19 clinical call center it opened five days ago it's a 24 7 call center for clinicians and um health departments and a close colleague of mine is is manning it and she is referring clinicians actually to our echoes here um as well but she asked me to um let you you all know that this call center is for clinicians um and health departments if they have any urgent questions it i think it is being manned by physicians and advanced practice providers and they're giving cdc guidance and and particular questions so i think it's a really good um thing to know about if you have any urgent questions day and night and maybe to take a little load off of nestor on the pals call 24 7 too so the first question is um is ivermectin nester being explored for treatment after um some studies have shown um some in vitro studies have shown the inhibition of viral rna transcription there has been i know some studies on ivermectin right there is uh at least evidence in vitro that that hybrid mechanism also inhibits the virus there are actually a lot of of uh molecules being considered for clinical trials um i actually reviewed a paper in in journal that actually mentioned over 300 research protocols are being conducted at this moment in the united states and other countries looking for different interventions pharmacologic and otherwise intervention for copic night team i don't know if there's a specific protocol already for hybrid mechan but i wouldn't be surprised because there are many many molecules that have um either immunomodulator effect or direct antiviral that are being evaluated in different clinical trials either alone or in combination uh but but to my knowledge i i haven't really seen a protocol on either mechan um yet but i wouldn't be surprised to be honest thank you um and uh we might have uh touched on this last week but might you touch on it again your thoughts related to the uh timing of remdissevere and this other um immune modulating drug i'm i'm gonna not pronounce it right but uh t-o-l-i-c-i-z-u-m-a-b yeah the toss-illissum yes and and and you know because we we don't have uh well uh randomized control trials everything that i'm going to say sort of in analogy to what we know from other viral infections in general um you know this this viral infection and kobe 19 is not an exception it's actually pretty typical uh there is a component that the virus um that is it's it's the fault of the virus it's virus directed inflammation but then there's an uncontrolled immune response uh and and damaging immune response that also uh activates the coagulation cascade uh activate the cytokine storm so we have sort of uh you know two two phases to this disease that the viral and the immunologic i think for in general for antivirals to work they need to be used earlier so i wouldn't be surprised if most of the study points to our earlier rather than late uh efficacy for these drugs so if you use a antiviral probably late in the second week when the patient is already in icu it's probably going to be very hard to show efficacy uh and so so in general i think and this is true with influenza the earlier you use the antiviral the the better uh chance the patient have to to to have a good recovery or or or or do not advance to more severe disease on the other hand there are some drugs that have been or that i have that they are being considered in the in the more advanced patients and toscilisumati is an example because toscilicium it's a it's a it's an inhibitor of il-6 one of the cytokines that are elevated uh in the cytokine storm that this patient experienced so i think some of those immune modulators may be more useful in a sub-population of patients that actually have this severe inflammatory state um on the other hand there's there's mounting evidence that probably early anti-population something like low molecular weight heparin prophylactically maybe it may be useful in hospitalized patients so so you know we are learning a lot but i think if anything antivirals and including convalescent plasma are going to be useful if anything at the beginning early in the disease uh more than really late um and and some others may maybe still have some usefulness late but it will be mostly in the immune modulator uh or trying to quiet down the immune system at the end to prevent the excess inflammation excess correlation etc thanks mister i think you answered a couple of the questions under the treatment someone else i that dr urbina from akama asked kind of how would you suggest using low resource how would you suggest low resource institutions or kind of maybe critical access hospitals modulate this cytokine storm to prevent this moderate to severe disease but i think you answered that you gave a lot of kind of ideas in that in that sense um let me ask you one more question then i'll turn it over to carla is there any proof that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be gifted be given has that been disproven nestor right there is no evidence one way or the other at the beginning there was a general sort of a blanket recommendation from wa show and i think an official in france uh who actually a health official in france france who said that they were somewhat contra indicated um but i haven't seen any solid evidence in favor or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs what i say all the time if you use it for just fever control it's probably better to use a safer drug like like acetaminophen or paracetamol paracetamol at this point because we have no evidence of efficacy or or toxicity um and and there are some uh studies that that the non-steroidal may increase the number of receptors the h2 receptor so the i think until we have solid evidence i would say if you if you have a fever and you're at home with the kovid just take acetaminophen if you need to take anything uh for the fever um as opposed to to nonsteroidal until we really learn with more solid evidence if they are uh deleterious or or or if they help in any way thank you nestor before we move away from the treatment questions do you um can you just give an update about what uh clinical trials are going on at unm sure yeah we have several of them uh we have a uh one of the earliest trials that we started was the hydroxychromoquin combined with acetomycin right after we saw the the study from the french and the endorsement of the fda for for this combination we started an open label trial for patients and and we have been using hydroxychromic when combined with acetomycin in some of the patients that are in icu this is an open label study so we're probably not going to learn a lot from it i mean we have the some patients that did not use that combination so we will have at least historical controls uh but as i said it's just a it's an open label study mostly um directed towards allowing us access to the drugs um but now that we are sort of accumulating evidence of probably the the inefficacy or or or lack of efficacy of uh hydroxychloroquine and in fact some issues about toxicity because there's a carrier toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin also has the same uh problem with the prolongation of the qtc the the qtc segment in the ekg which is associated with some uh really dangerous ventricular arrhythmias so so we're probably going to move away from those drugs and then we are actually discussing them on each other about that that trial there's also uh we are in the planning stages of using convalescent plasma which is the other tool and we in fact we have we are applying to four different protocols one protocol in prophylaxis let's say a person like a family member close family member of a copy patient the question is can can that person receive plasma and prevent the disease from from uh from establishing itself so there's a there's a pulse exposure prophylaxis and also for a healthcare worker exposed so we have we are working on on starting that trial for possible exposure prophylaxis there's another trial for ambulatory patients patients that that are test positive but they are um not sick enough to be hospitalized can we give them convalescent plasma uh to prevent hospitalization and then there are two other trials for for uh mildly ill and and severely ill patients um looking at convalescent plasma there are a couple of um of sort of basic science studies that we are planning also to see the mutation rate of the virus to see the immune response of the virus the group from global health are actually planning uh these are more uh biological and immunological studies than than therapeutic studies so we have you know quite a few uh clinical trials which are about to start are in the process of carrying getting irb approval uh some of the them are local trials others are multi-center so we're participating with with tough university and uh and and um and also other universities to to develop these these multi-center uh trials thank you so much so i'm going to ask a couple questions about testing and screening um one of the questions from uh from somebody ackman also somebody in clovis given results in new england journal of medicine regarding pregnant patients should all pregnant and patients be screened for cobit 19. yeah i think this is a really powerful story uh uh obviously the the right answer you have to know what's going on in your community you're not gonna test uh all pregnant females if there's no community outbreak in in your area but if you're in an area where there is like you know widespread community transmission um it's probably based on these evidence it's probably a good idea to test in order to protect yourself i mean your your team your healthcare workers and and also know that that the that the mother is it's a copy positive and takes some actions regarding the the newborn also so i think it does makes make some sense uh but we have to see the the prevalence of the disease in the community the availability of resources the the including the tests the swaps to make up you know a more precise decision regarding regarding this uh this strategy sorry about that thank you nestor um do you i know that our department of health colleagues aren't on today but do you can you go over the latest criteria in new mexico for testing you you want me to go over yeah no i'm just saying i don't marla's not on today but if you if you can go over that that would be great yeah i think uh the the most uh like important criteria is symptomatic patient patients who have symptoms suggestive of covet including some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia or loss of sense of taste may trigger the need for the test they have also increased the number of or or increased the indication to certain situations where there's a congregation of people like uh in prisons jail nursing homes you can do testing even in asymptomatic patients those are the general guidelines um obviously the department of health um when they're doing an investigation of an outbreak they they also have some um you know flexibility in doing the test to the contacts and people around them but but it's really symptomatic patients and um in places where there is congregation of people like like nursing home jails and other and other instances where there's there's a lot of people living together thank you very much and a couple of other i know that i'm not sure if you know the answer to this but um one of the questions from uh albuquerque as well as is there any rapid testing in new mexico and i know we talked about this a little bit on monday and we don't have carissa un unfortunately on the line but if you if you want to speak to that nester yeah i can tell you what i know i mean i've been in so many zooms meetings at different levels that i have some information obviously not final thing but i know the the a person from the state lab commented that the state was receiving 30 able machines these are the 15 minutes uh rapid testing machines and they're going to distribute it mostly to like rural hospitals or areas where they don't have ready access to to testing so that was really good news they still don't have enough of the reagents or the cartridges that this machine use but they're going to receive more in the next few days if they haven't received it so so yes we're going to have some of this rapid testing obviously only 30 so far but 30 is better than zero so we're going to have some places especially in the highly affected areas that are going to have access to to this test i know also that we at unmh probably will get uh cartridges for the gene expert which is which is a relatively rapid test it's not like 15 minutes but it gives you an answer in less than less than an hour uh so we may be able to have that test available and that is important because we have seen cases for instance patients who come and need like emerging surgery or delivery or they're going to deliver a baby or they need some acute intervention and they may have symptoms objective for kobe they may have you know a little bit of cough or fever and but they they have another medical problem like an acute mi or they need emerging appendectomy and and it's good to to have a test so you can rapidly triage those patients okay they have some respiratory system but they're called negative so you can go ahead and do the procedure and don't waste uh you know uh ppe etc so i think there's a place and we are gonna get the rapid test and before and before i get asked there's also uh in development the the serologic test and they said that in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks uh we're gonna have a serologic test to detect igg i don't know how i mean at the beginning they're gonna probably have a learning curve and and they're going to be increasing their capacity initially will be restricted somehow um as it happened with this pcr base test at the beginning that it was available but very limited but i think in a matter of several weeks we'll probably be able to have this or logic test also more readily available across across the state which is good news uh because when the when the search passes we really want to know how many people what percentage of the population was affected and it's going to be important for like returning back to work see if you're if you have been exposed or not and other interventions that i think serological tests may have some useful usefulness thank you nestor and just as a reminder to those everyone next monday david grenache who's leading the um serologic testing at tricor is going to be on so he can give us an update about where we're at with zerologic testing thank you over to you joanna thank you so much carla i wanted to let you know also um that uh uh elizabeth uh rosenbaum who uh runs uh the former united blood services now by talent is uh is willing to come on and talk about uh the serology and um the you know plot plasma um ex you know plasma exchange um nester that probably in the next week or two so that would be a help as well um i i wanted to know if um uh diane gassin or teresa chavez was on the line if they wanted to unmute and ask their question about um about immunity after being infected are you are are you are either of you on the line diane or teresa okay um and i wondered if peggy spencer was on the line dr spencer okay peggy sorry hey peggy hey there you are i saw you earlier good to see you um do you want to ask your you had a couple of really good questions everyone's questions are great i wanted to see if you might want to answer your questions directly i don't remember what they were um they were about the um the advising patients to um you know if they are symptomatic at home covet positive getting in a prone position would you like to ask oh yeah oh yeah um because i'd heard about proning being used in the hospital so i was just wondering about advising people at home whether that's a good idea for them at home to keep if that's if there's any evidence that that helps it keep it from progressing yeah that's a great question and i haven't seen any publication for for data at home but i have been in several um presentations where experts icu experts from especially from the east coast are are uh you know relating that patients especially in the icu when they are placed on the prone position they improve their oxygenation and it has to do with with several factors with the with the blood flow within the lungs at the location of the the most affected areas and the lungs of brony seems to be helping i saw also and this was just a slide in one of the experts that actually mentioned that they were doing voluntary prone in the in the emergency department and in the in the general awards because of the same reason because we have used prone in before in icus and intubated patient but they are suggesting that there's probably uh also benefit of doing it outside icu i guess like in in the emergency room or general wars i haven't seen anything at home for that it would be interesting to to do a study and see because it's relatively simple i mean you can do it with a pulse oximeter and measure if the oxygenation improves but i have seen that i haven't seen any literature just as i said expert opinion part of presentations uh but i haven't seen any written like you know like a recommendation to actually implement prone on on patient but it's really a good question and i think it's not difficult to answer that question because you can you can do a before and after with with the pulse oximeter and see if actually patients improve by changing the position voluntarily thank you so much dr spencer um dr sosa i i'm wondering if you might be able to address this a little bit one of uh our our colleagues dr strumminger sent us a um just uh just some email uh literature this morning about delaying um putting someone on a ventilator because it might not be as useful as we had once thought um can you can you kind of uh critique that and kind of say what you think about that yeah again i want to say the disclaimer that i'm not an icu person and this is not my my strength but i have seen uh the comments going back and forth in the icu community um some people claim that that we're probably uh intubating people too early and and that actually ventilatory support may be damaging for the lungs in some cases um but i have seen the other the other comment also because if you delay intubation and you have to do it on an emergency basis because the patient is really short of breath they can even go into cardiac arrest and be a more difficult integration so so i i mean i i'm not going to say in i'm going to not going to be on one side or the other i think we need to look at the evidence and actually ask the experts from icu what is the latest on that on that but i know it's a concern uh and it's a difficult decision because when you have a patient that it's you know having trouble breathing and you're actually uh agonizing over should i intubate him and it's every day in all hospitals uh that decision is made and it's a difficult one because you know that that the mortality once they're intubated it's very high in some in some publications 50 others have seen up to 80 percent mortality once they they developed the ards the cytokine storm and go into a into a mechanical support so i think the jury is still out is the ventilator you know more makes more harm than good um it's really difficult to tell at this stage thank you great thank you i wanted to see if um if lisa cope is on if she would like to ask her question it came through the chat but i just wanted just to give a little bit more context and explain the question a little bit more lisa if you cannot meet yourself okay yes yeah i know but at least is one of the uh administrators here but uh my name is rajeev patel i'm a pulmonary intensivist at uh rehoboth hospital and gallup and we have a 54 year old uh woman who is chronic dialysis who's now trached after spending i think 18 days um uh with an endotracheal tube and she's doing actually quite well minimal event support but uh the quest so her third swab was negative we did a confirmatory uh after 24-hour interval that came back positive so i was gonna check a fifth uh after one week but i'm just kind of making that up um and i i don't know what other people are doing when you've got a negative and the confirmatory turns positive can you speak to that yes yeah that's very difficult and let me just give sort of a more general perspective i mean what we are measuring with this pcr it's rna it's the presence of rna in the in the respiratory secretion not actually unfortunately we don't have a sensitive enough tool to to measure infecting virus we're just measuring a section of the virus the rna and we know for instance if we use the analogy of tuberculosis people who are treated and no longer infections may still have dna of the of the bacilli for weeks or months in the respiratory secretions and that doesn't mean that they transmit uh so something similar may be happening with this virus we are detecting intermittently especially in patients that have had like a a really complicated course and we've seen this in the literature that they persist positive or they are intermittently positive do that means that they are transmitting the disease because they have uh the presence of the virus in their i mean the presence of the rna of the virus we do not know the there is a german study in which they actually tried to culture the virus they use cells to culture the virus and they were not able to culture any virus if there were less than 10 to the six so one million copies of rna after below that threshold they were not able to co to culture in cells the virus so so we know that that that rna is probably much more sensitive uh to detect rna than to detect infectious virus so so it's it's a difficult question in that case if the patient is going home um i wouldn't have any problem you know sending the person home but if it is with a tracheostomy it's going to like like a skill nor facility then you you really have to follow the cdc recommendation of having two consecutive uh negative uh rnas but but i still i don't think we're do we are sure that that is necessary and we'll probably learn more when we do you know other epidemiological studies with these patients who are discharged they actually still infection my feeling is that once the patient has you know neutralizing antibodies and and are clinically improving and are not coughing on a fever even if they have rna in their respiratory secretion they're probably not as infectious as they were in the first five days based on the data that we know from from some of the cruise ships and that they have done cultures and and also pcr and this german study that i mentioned um that that was also very well designed although it was really small but very well designed in which they were not able to culture buyers after certain days of disease progression thank you nestor and an important question just came through the chat was sort of related to this can you review which patient should have or might need a confirmatory testing or sequential testing can you talk a little bit about that yeah i think the the main indication if the person is not going to be discharged home but it's going to a to a facility where there is more you know more people living together um that that some centers are are asking for a negative actually two consecutive negative uh tests separated by 24 hours if the patient or the person is going to go home and can be isolated at home i think that there's no need for him to be negative as long as he's following the isolation the home isolation rules and and preventing their relatives to be being exposed to the buyers so i think that's that's uh the the the i think the general rule that they are they are asking for that if they're going to be transferred to another facility or to a rehab or or some skill nor facility that they are negative but otherwise otherwise uh if they're going to go home they can go home because we are sending people with positive copied home if they don't have any symptoms so that's that's essentially the the issue here thank you and you know i think that a little bit of the confusion is about the the use of the word confirmatory because it sounds like you have one test and then you have a confirmation test but but you're just talking about the one pcr test correct correct yeah they're the same test done twice it's just because of the intermittency of the positive test that's what they they ask for two consecutive i mean probably if you do three maybe the third is positive but the rule says two if you have two negative you're you're good to go um with the information that we have and follow in cdc recommendation but again you know we're probably overdoing it we probably you know in a patient who's 21 28 days into their illness and they have clear the secretion clear the x-ray they are a fever they're not coughing you know the chances that they are transmitting it's small not zero but probably small from what we have seen in this in the published story so far thank you nestor and i'm going to ask a couple of questions about immunity and transmission there was a question that came through the chat about if a mom has copied 19 is she can she breastfeed her baby yeah i think uh uh you know breastfeeding is okay uh the problem is i mean there's no evidence of transmission through through the milk the problem is also also the the close proximity of the baby to the mother so there's there's it's not just the breastfeeding itself the the milk itself as a as a way to transmit is the the proximity of the mother to the child that puts a risk to this to this baby so it's really a difficult difficult uh question to answer in the in the practical sense thank you and i know that um there's not a clear answer to this yet but can you just talk about what we know about people who are and how what their immunity is like after their if people are immune after they get infected right yeah that's a that's a great question you're right we don't have a definitive answer and i'm gonna just mention several things we know uh we have some experience with before i mean we have the endemic coronavirus and we have stars and mirrors what we know from the from the old coronaviruses from the endemic coronavirus that are associated with common cold people do develop immunity but the immunity doesn't last too long it lasts you know for months maybe a couple of years and then it goes down because we know that these coronaviruses actually come back every few years and they actually alternate there's one coronavirus circulating and the others are suppressed then the following year you have another coronavirus and so on and so forth so we know that coronavirus in general induces immunity when when when a person is infected we know that there's immunity also to stars and tumors in there are patients who had sars in way in the in you know 20 years ago and they had some detectable immunity so if this virus is going to behave the same we are going to have some degree of immunity regarding kobe 19 specifically you know we know we don't know too much about it but we know that there are patients who recover that have neutralizing antibodies because that's actually the marker that we're using or one of the markers that we're using to to uh to select convalescent plasma to use as treatment that the person have titles of neutralizing antibodies neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent cells in the laboratory from being infected there are there are sort of protective antibodies um because they attack the virus they attach to to a very important part of the virus which is a spike protein and prevent the virus from entering the cell so it is safe to assume that is if a person recovers and develops this neutralizing antibodies that person should be protected well we don't know really it's it's how long those those um protective antibodies are gonna last it's gonna be you know six months a year two years we do not know because you know this virus is only four or five months old um so we don't really know what the effect on the on the immune system and the same goes for the vaccine if a successful vaccine is developed we don't know if we're going to have to use it every couple of years every year like influenza because we don't really know what the need is going to be and there's also the possibility of some uh mutation and evolution of the virus the virus under the pressure of of the immune system may have uh mutations in their spike protein and other important parts of the viral may change over time when they're circulating in you know in thousands and thousands of human beings there may be some changes in the virus and we may need to reformulate the vaccine or people may need to have a different um or may have a second infection at some point in the in the in the future if the virus mutates a lot so those are all you know interesting things but we still don't know the definitive answer for most of those of those questions and that is something that that uh you know makes public health uh officials worry because we can have you know circulation of disaster for a longer period of time we have second wave we may need a uh reformulation of accidents when they are available etc so it's it's it's tough i mean the future is too complicated thank you um this is joanna here um i was wondering if octavia had a chat question and i'm wondering if she's on the line if she might be able to unmute for us and ask um her question yes i'm here a physician approached me this morning we definitely are for those patients under investigation and um covet 19 patients using the proper ppe he he said recently acog released something that says that we should wear the ppe and n95s for all second stage i looked on the site i could not find anything for everyone because of the new study out saying that so many people walk around asymptomatic and could actually have it and because second stage they're pushing the amount of aerosols in the air so i was wondering if anybody else heard anything no i haven't heard about that but i can tell you what we are doing here in um unm and and and i agree i mean there is there are uh some evidence that this virus can survive in the air we know that there are experiments in which they have they have actually taken samples from the air of in rooms of patients and they are able to find the virus there we know that there are some procedures that generate aerosols um like intubation cpr and relationship and other natural which in theory can contain the virus but then again the the measures that we recommend um because the main transmission mode is actually through droplets so to large droplet or direct contact with patients um most of the most of the contacts with patients are done with just contact precautions and and droplet precautions you don't need to use the n95 in all the situations when you are near one of these patients unless unless the patient is um you know a mechanical ventilation or they have they are going to undergo a procedure that generates aerosols because we know although in theory uh there could be uh you know viral particles in the air the chances and and the practical chances are are really small and and we gather these from from you know for instance uh the healthcare workers mo a lot of the haircut workers that get infected is because they're not using any ppe or or they didn't put a mask on the patient or actually they got in the community not necessarily because they were using contact precautions um so that's what the recommendation the general use of contact precaution and there's also another reality and it's the limited amount of n95 mass uh so you have to use it when really need it if you have a limited amount it's just a rational thing to do to use and only when when you are at high risk of being exposed to aerosol as opposed to you know in all contacts with patients that you put into you that you need so are you putting not just general ma mass on all patients during second stage um yeah i don't know if you can clarify what do you mean by second second stage when and when it's time to deliver because that's when we get all the pushing and grunting and all the interesting things we do i haven't been to the labor and delivery i will defer that question to maybe the infection control colleagues um because i i don't know what what type of pp they're using inside the the labor and delivery room here at unm uh yeah and i don't mean those that's tested positive or under suspicion i see allen waving but here if you can answer i'm listening i've also a physician a retired physician uh i have not found a publication a medical publication but i can tell you that it is now a common practice in all obstetrical units along the east coast in all women active in active second stage labor or if coughing are currently having a routine surgical mass placed on them okay uh no as to my knowledge no one's putting n95 on patients the last time that was recommended was by dr scars at the very start of this and that's now been retracted n95s are reserved for individuals who are in situations where there's definite um you know you're working on a definite positive we're just too short of 95's of importance there is an article that showed up in archives internal medicine a letter from april the 8th i believe that has subsequently been debunked that was a small chinese study suggesting that there was no significant difference between folks wearing a mask and coughing that study has been debunked because there was no negative control what they did in that case is they put out small containers of viral transport media they had patients cough as a positive control they found roughly uh 10 to the third log base 10 to the third to 10 to the fourth number of viruses from just open coughing these were active covenant patients four of them and they put on a mask and they had them cough and surprisingly they had very little difference in the number of organisms found what that ultimately proved they did not do a negative control what that proved is that after you cough there are a lot of particles that continue to stay in the atmosphere so without a negative control that that study failed but the general understanding is that a routine surgical mask does significantly decrease the number of virus particles that can transmit out especially in large droplet it's not going to stop things that are smaller than 5 microns we don't believe that most of the viruses coming out of individuals as they cough are that small so definitely i think the strong recommendation currently is that routine surgical mass either procedure type or tie type should be placed on women as they move into active labor and begin breathing heavily okay that's the current recommendation that i've seen that's the current practice thank thanks dr caro thank you and thank you octavia can't pronounce it thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much um dr sosa i'm going to move on to one more question and give it back to carla if a person is exposed to someone with uh who's covet positive when when might you test that person if they become sick when might you test that person or might you not test that person how long would it take uh for a test to become positive in general the first i mean it depends on the strategy are you using uh if the person is asymptomatic and it's not within one of the recommended protocols you don't have to test them but you have to instruct the patient to uh to to enter a quarantine of 14 days to prevent in case they develop the disease to transmit it to others usually the incubation period for this disease is around five days and we know that probably 48 hours before the symptoms are present patients uh start to to uh to disseminate or may disseminate the virus so you know the testing it's it's indicated really when they develop symptoms most of the time so but but we know from from studies that were done especially with the cruise ships affected um that there were people who excreted the virus two days before they actually developed symptoms and we know now for more from more recent studies that there are there are patients who develop who do not develop symptoms they're actually uh pcr positive and as i said with the study with the pregnant females that was a proportion of seven to one so seven um to one more frequent uh asymptomatic shedding than actually symptomatic setting in those in those uh labor and delivery uh patients or patients at the end of the of the of pregnancy so so there's definitely a lot of asymptomatic excretions but the moment for testing is when you develop symptoms based on the on the current recommendation unless there's another um you know factor that makes you tested earlier if the person is in a nursing home or or within another uh situation when there's a lot of people in the same physical space thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually ask one of my dear colleagues robert gish to unmute himself and ask the question about iga all right thanks these echo sessions have been fantastic nestor carla the rest of your team i really appreciate being involved that i shaved today so i could turn on my video just so you know i was off before um i've been very interested in the antibodies uh nestor and the rest of the team here about this whole issue about protection immune status neutralizing antibodies etc i keep reading more information at iga as a secretory antibody for gi and lung may be absolutely critical and are we testing for iga what proof do we have that iga may be protective should all the new tests come out including abbott came out with a test today for covid hiv hepatitis b hepatitis c that was released and covered on the lay press today anyway so iga is the main question thank you yeah unfortunately robert i haven't i haven't seen anything there's a good story and i'm trying to remember uh where was it published out of china in which they and i think the title is like immune reaction or immune uh uh response to copy 19 in which they detail um the different antibodies that are produced obviously secretory iga should be key to decreased uh infectivity and transmission but i haven't seen any any anything specific about that nor have i seen any any uh tests that involve iga most of them that i've seen are igg rgm combination not actually iga so it would be really interesting to see if there any but i haven't seen any i'm going to actually look into into that and review that article from the chinese to see if they actually measure i think they mentioned something about idea but i'm i'm not sure because i don't remember out of the top of my head the details of the of the measurement uh quest is going to have a soft roll out of an antibody test and i've asked them or advised them to add iga to that panel so expect here's something from quests in the next 48 to 72 hours great thank you to both of you um i just wanted to to let everybody know that the cme link for the session is now in the chat box again you have to copy it and paste it into your own web browser but it's it's sometimes hard to see because it gets lost in all the questions but um it came in there from elena martinez so you can take a look at that and i'll ask another question mr um there was a couple more questions well actually i'm going to ask a sort of big picture question which i know you don't know the answer to but you can at least give us your opinion there are several um there are several questions just about when we anticipate our peak in cases in new mexico and also a question about if you know of any plans for new mexico to join other states for development of sort of a reopening plan after the shut this shutdown you're right i don't know the answers to this question no just kidding i'm going to give you my opinion no actually uh yeah i've seen a couple of models there's a model that have been developed by uh by the um by a group that is actually advising the governor and and you know this mother had been moving and they they they seem to be expecting a peak in the middle of may that's what i heard and there are different type of peaks depending on what intervention that what measures are are um are taken or sustained until until that point and and also the the same modeling includes different predictions regarding beds icu beds and ventilators so it's really complicated uh but at least we know that that that uh you know in in some instances the people will be you know in some of the models i've seen late april and they go all the way to middle of may and then hopefully a descent um into june um i i don't know the answer to the to the second question definitely not thank you nestor and i i this is another hard question i i think you went over testing already but uh marianne spencer was wanting to know is there any testing of healthcare workers who are asymptomatic no we're not we're not routinely testing at least here at unmh uh asymptomatic persons if they have been exposed and and exposed meaning a close contact so somebody examine a patient or spend more than a few minutes with the patient without the appropriate ppe and then we know that that person has been exposed then they go into quarantine and they have some close follow-up of symptoms but not routine testing as far as i know and until this this this um this point great thank you and one other testing question that came through we're still hearing that um around the country even symptomatic people can't get tested is that a problem here in new mexico uh you know that i don't know i i mean it's not it's not an issue here for us at the university hospital we we have been increasing and tricore has been really increasing their capacity to the point and now we get an answer in less than 24 hours sometimes even you know half a day uh we can get an answer and a and if it's uh you know recommended by one of the physicians based on the symptoms that the patient is tested so but i i cannot speak for the rest of the of the state which i know it's there are different conditions in different areas of of the state yeah i mean i know from just from from i'm talking to colleagues that the availability is is very good for testing in new mexico as far as i know and i don't know if there's anyone on the line that's having trouble getting tested getting tests but but there there are a lot of different places where people can actually get tested at this point so joanne i'm going to turn it back over to you for the last couple of questions sure um what i might just add is that i'm gonna refer people back again to the new mexico department of health covid um website and actually the state yesterday just put out a really nice interactive map that actually shows the testing sites by county as well so there's a link from health and human human services division back to department of health so there's the department of health really has a nice interactive map that you can get to about test sites and they also doing the um calls like it was a call today from the hospital association and they went over state statistics great thing thanks octavia um fantastic um i wanted to ask um uh nestor about um just in general possibly unm university of new mexico but in general um the visitor guidelines uh we're hearing a lot just nationally but also locally um what the visitor guidelines are or perhaps the the kind of strictness of um kind of no visitors being allowed can you might might be able to go over that as as far as you know no i'm sorry johanna i'm not familiar with the visitor that have been implemented by infectious control with the hospital leadership and i haven't really paid attention unfortunately i've been so busy with the you know all the other stuff that i i don't i've see i've seen very few visitors but i would wouldn't be qualified to answer that question to be honest what i can do is i can take this question and and we can ask it on friday at our covet echo um where we'll have um either megan brett or another doctor striker another hospital epidemiologist and there were a lot of good questions related to ventilators today and i want to let our participants know we also have a critical care echo every thursday from eight to nine in the morning and michelle harkins uh leads that echo and so um for those questions too those might be uh directed towards michelle and critical care questions as well i might ask one more question and james urbina from acoma wants to know about different um supplements like uh um tumeric and cucumber um and how they're being used in terms of investigational studies in terms of um il-6 suppression and immune modulation have you heard anything nestor about using some supplements and in terms of um immune suppression no unfortunately i haven't the the only thing that i have seen because i've seen many protocols from different places both in europe and here are the inclusion of of for instance vitamin c uh they're people just empirically using uh high doses vitamin c i have seen also the inclusion of zinc supplementation in the diet because we know that zinc has some uh utility in in common cold in other respiratory viruses i have seen the use of statins interestingly enough uh statins as you know has some anti-inflammatory rheologic properties and and so there there are researchers and and even a clinician using statins or maintaining statins on their on their patients as a way to decrease inflammation but i haven't seen anything on on turmeric or or or that those specific supplements as an anti-inflammatory uh but i've seen a lot a lot of things been used obviously without much support but but people are are sort of trying or testing their different uh different uh things that that you know to a certain point makes sense but but nestor but but zinc and vitamin c so some maybe some um water-soluble vitamins that are antioxidants perhaps right nestor any last minute um we have about two minutes to the top of the hour any closing statements i think the most important thing and actually want to do sort of a pitch in favor of the convalescent plasma because there are a lot of providers here at some point we're going to need um convalescent plasma to to to treat some of the patients when we're doing the clinical studies either prophylactic or therapeutic so if if if you can talk into your positive patient those who are taking care of calling patients to encourage them or their relatives that are positive to approach when the when the moment is right to approach uh you know the blood banks or the places where they donate blood and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma we would be great i hope we're probably going to have like a media advertisement to disregard but i think you know a patient to provide or provided to patient uh recommendation or suggestion is so powerful so so i would definitely encourage if if you if you are treating patients with kobe that that are uh you know minimally symptomatic or doing well at home if you can ask them at some point when when vitalan and the red cross are ready to receive them which is going to be very soon to actually to actually do it because we're going to need a lot of convalescent plasma um and and that would be that would be you know a good a good um thing to do to help the patients thank you so much nestor we're right at the top of the hour so thanks again everyone for joining um we just as a reminder the cme link is in this uh is in the chat box and multiple times now if you can go in there and copy it and um joanna mentioned our other echoes but we do have four out of the five days of the week have covered related echoes and you can learn you can find out more about them on our website into the code 19 page so thank you so much everyone for joining and we will see you hopefully soon joanne dr cassman yes check your email uh the society for wgyn hospitalist has put out a protocol uh strongly recommending uh masking for patients in active labor whether uh coveted positive or coveted unknown all so take a look at your email okay sure thanks you   \n",

hello everybody i'm here hey nestor it's carla good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious disease office hours we're very excited to see everybody here today and welcome to those who've been before and welcome to any new participants as well just a couple of housekeeping announcement announcements before we get started um for those of you who are familiar with project echo we really like to our one of our goals is building community and so we really like to see people's faces so if you do not have if you have a camera and don't have it on we would love for you to turn it on and keep it on during the session if possible we would ask that people keep themselves muted unless they're called on by one of the facilitators we will try as always to answer all the questions that were submitted through the registration and we will also we would also love to hear your questions on the chat so if you have a question during this session please um enter it into the chat box and we'll try to get to those as well um a couple of other things we have a digital librarian who's amazing and and during this process uh during the entire session he'll be putting some links into the chat based on questions that come in so you can always look at the chat too to find more information because of many of you know there's been a lot of security issues with zinc with um zoom lately so we can't actually put hyperlinks in the chat anymore so if you want to go to one of those links you have to copy and paste them and put them into your own web browser and lastly our website is being updated all the time with videos of the sessions and other resources so please please go to that if you want more information okay so i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm going to do a couple of introductions and then i'll ask one question then and turn it over to joanna um i want to introduce our uh office hours with nester sosa who's our chief of uh the division of infectious diseases here at the university of new mexico and he is generously offered his to do this three times a week so we really appreciate it and he's been busy sort of on the front lines and has a lot of good information so nestor i'll have you introduce yourself in just a minute and just give us a little update on anything that you think is important for the group to know and i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and we work closely together she'll be helping to moderate the question question and answer section so nestor why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and please say a few words if you will sure thank you thank you very much carla and thank thank you everybody for one more time connecting and sending those uh excellent questions i think um really on the on the research front we we're starting to see um a couple of publications um a little bit you know debunking the the hope that we have with hydroxychloroquine there was a publication from brazil that actually showed uh increased toxicity when they use the the original molecule the chloroquine molecule especially cardiac toxicity and there is a pre-publication that is going to come out in the british medical journal of probably one of the first comparative trial of hydroxyl chloroquine versus control or placebo and it showed no benefit um and these were close to 180 181 subjects so so i think um we're probably going to be looking into other uh other uh products like rendezvous or maybe the convalescent plasma as some hope for for uh for a useful therapeutic intervention but i think soon we're going to have to be revising the recommendations and and protocols in many of the centers um here in the us uh in you know in view of these uh these results and then we you know continue to follow the very closely the the development of the literature and the scientific uh publications over thank you investor and i wanted to introduce one more person um i wanted to introduce you all to juanita barapa she's a medical director of medicaid here in new mexico and i just wanted to see if she had any announcements from medicaid or hsd that she would like to just share with us today juanita thank you oh hi good uh good afternoon everyone uh i want to thank uh practical and uh faculty you know assist us in learning subject together and medicaid we're trying to take advantage of uh other i shouldn't set advantage but we want to take a full cap capability that the federal government assistance to the state in terms of uh you know the waivers and uh the new way to do business via telehealth or telemedicine and telephone so um hsd and um medical assistant division working around the clock trying to keep up with all these uh blanket waivers to try to bring the uh the um the benefits to the state so i'd like to thank everyone you know hard work and also education to take care of our members thank you so much juanita so i'm going to just ask one question then i'll turn it over to joanna um nestor there's been a lot of questions over the last couple of weeks about masks and um one of the questions from today was does wearing a mask outside make sense and one you know there was a question last week uh last on monday that i don't think we got to that someone asked a very similar thing that these masks aren't masks that that protects you from viruses basically they're not homemade masks or cloth masks and so what does does it make sense what is the reason for wearing them right now yeah that's an excellent question and in fact to be honest at the beginning of the epidemic i didn't see any sense in the general public using mask but with the mounting evidence on especially on asymptomatic transmission or pre-symptomatic transmission it makes makes sense to use a mask more than anything to prevent youth infecting other people so it's actually because there are patients or or subjects that contract this infection and do not develop any symptoms but they can infect their their um co-workers or persons around them it makes sense to wear a mask because that contains to a certain degree the the respiratory droplets the saliva when you cough when you talk so it's more than anything to protect other people than to protect yourself because we know that a simple cloth mask or even a surgical mask is not 100 protective for you um for infection if there are aerosols in the air that contain the virus but on the other hand you are definitely limiting the spread of your respiratory secretions if you wear a mask in public so i think um it makes sense now to to to use that recommendation especially if you're going to be if you're going to go to the grocery store to the supermarket or to any place where you're going to be close to other people in order to protect them it's reasonable to wear a mask and we have seen this in in you know videos and and uh news from from from japan and china that they use it all the time even before the kobe my team was uh discover or prevalent so so now it really really makes sense on the current uh you know information that we have about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transition which is which is pretty um uh pretty significant i mean i just i just saw an article uh yesterday um and published in the new england journal about they actually tested over 200 pregnant females that went to the labor and delivery room and they found that 13 of them had asymptomatic viral shedding as opposed to one point something so it's seven times more frequent to have a young uh person treating the virus without even having symptoms uh than than symptoms so so asymptomatic transmission it's it's it's been appreciated more and more so that it makes sense just to wear a mask to protect others under those conditions thank you thank you nestor thanks carla this is joanna katzman here um i'm going to nestor if it's okay i'm gonna start with some treatment questions but i did want to let everybody know you might have seen the slide before the session and on the chat about the new um cdc covered 19 clinical call center it opened five days ago it's a 24 7 call center for clinicians and um health departments and a close colleague of mine is is manning it and she is referring clinicians actually to our echoes here um as well but she asked me to um let you you all know that this call center is for clinicians um and health departments if they have any urgent questions it i think it is being manned by physicians and advanced practice providers and they're giving cdc guidance and and particular questions so i think it's a really good um thing to know about if you have any urgent questions day and night and maybe to take a little load off of nestor on the pals call 24 7 too so the first question is um is ivermectin nester being explored for treatment after um some studies have shown um some in vitro studies have shown the inhibition of viral rna transcription there has been i know some studies on ivermectin right there is uh at least evidence in vitro that that hybrid mechanism also inhibits the virus there are actually a lot of of uh molecules being considered for clinical trials um i actually reviewed a paper in in journal that actually mentioned over 300 research protocols are being conducted at this moment in the united states and other countries looking for different interventions pharmacologic and otherwise intervention for copic night team i don't know if there's a specific protocol already for hybrid mechan but i wouldn't be surprised because there are many many molecules that have um either immunomodulator effect or direct antiviral that are being evaluated in different clinical trials either alone or in combination uh but but to my knowledge i i haven't really seen a protocol on either mechan um yet but i wouldn't be surprised to be honest thank you um and uh we might have uh touched on this last week but might you touch on it again your thoughts related to the uh timing of remdissevere and this other um immune modulating drug i'm i'm gonna not pronounce it right but uh t-o-l-i-c-i-z-u-m-a-b yeah the toss-illissum yes and and and you know because we we don't have uh well uh randomized control trials everything that i'm going to say sort of in analogy to what we know from other viral infections in general um you know this this viral infection and kobe 19 is not an exception it's actually pretty typical uh there is a component that the virus um that is it's it's the fault of the virus it's virus directed inflammation but then there's an uncontrolled immune response uh and and damaging immune response that also uh activates the coagulation cascade uh activate the cytokine storm so we have sort of uh you know two two phases to this disease that the viral and the immunologic i think for in general for antivirals to work they need to be used earlier so i wouldn't be surprised if most of the study points to our earlier rather than late uh efficacy for these drugs so if you use a antiviral probably late in the second week when the patient is already in icu it's probably going to be very hard to show efficacy uh and so so in general i think and this is true with influenza the earlier you use the antiviral the the better uh chance the patient have to to to have a good recovery or or or or do not advance to more severe disease on the other hand there are some drugs that have been or that i have that they are being considered in the in the more advanced patients and toscilisumati is an example because toscilicium it's a it's a it's an inhibitor of il-6 one of the cytokines that are elevated uh in the cytokine storm that this patient experienced so i think some of those immune modulators may be more useful in a sub-population of patients that actually have this severe inflammatory state um on the other hand there's there's mounting evidence that probably early anti-population something like low molecular weight heparin prophylactically maybe it may be useful in hospitalized patients so so you know we are learning a lot but i think if anything antivirals and including convalescent plasma are going to be useful if anything at the beginning early in the disease uh more than really late um and and some others may maybe still have some usefulness late but it will be mostly in the immune modulator uh or trying to quiet down the immune system at the end to prevent the excess inflammation excess correlation etc thanks mister i think you answered a couple of the questions under the treatment someone else i that dr urbina from akama asked kind of how would you suggest using low resource how would you suggest low resource institutions or kind of maybe critical access hospitals modulate this cytokine storm to prevent this moderate to severe disease but i think you answered that you gave a lot of kind of ideas in that in that sense um let me ask you one more question then i'll turn it over to carla is there any proof that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be gifted be given has that been disproven nestor right there is no evidence one way or the other at the beginning there was a general sort of a blanket recommendation from wa show and i think an official in france uh who actually a health official in france france who said that they were somewhat contra indicated um but i haven't seen any solid evidence in favor or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs what i say all the time if you use it for just fever control it's probably better to use a safer drug like like acetaminophen or paracetamol paracetamol at this point because we have no evidence of efficacy or or toxicity um and and there are some uh studies that that the non-steroidal may increase the number of receptors the h2 receptor so the i think until we have solid evidence i would say if you if you have a fever and you're at home with the kovid just take acetaminophen if you need to take anything uh for the fever um as opposed to to nonsteroidal until we really learn with more solid evidence if they are uh deleterious or or or if they help in any way thank you nestor before we move away from the treatment questions do you um can you just give an update about what uh clinical trials are going on at unm sure yeah we have several of them uh we have a uh one of the earliest trials that we started was the hydroxychromoquin combined with acetomycin right after we saw the the study from the french and the endorsement of the fda for for this combination we started an open label trial for patients and and we have been using hydroxychromic when combined with acetomycin in some of the patients that are in icu this is an open label study so we're probably not going to learn a lot from it i mean we have the some patients that did not use that combination so we will have at least historical controls uh but as i said it's just a it's an open label study mostly um directed towards allowing us access to the drugs um but now that we are sort of accumulating evidence of probably the the inefficacy or or or lack of efficacy of uh hydroxychloroquine and in fact some issues about toxicity because there's a carrier toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin also has the same uh problem with the prolongation of the qtc the the qtc segment in the ekg which is associated with some uh really dangerous ventricular arrhythmias so so we're probably going to move away from those drugs and then we are actually discussing them on each other about that that trial there's also uh we are in the planning stages of using convalescent plasma which is the other tool and we in fact we have we are applying to four different protocols one protocol in prophylaxis let's say a person like a family member close family member of a copy patient the question is can can that person receive plasma and prevent the disease from from uh from establishing itself so there's a there's a pulse exposure prophylaxis and also for a healthcare worker exposed so we have we are working on on starting that trial for possible exposure prophylaxis there's another trial for ambulatory patients patients that that are test positive but they are um not sick enough to be hospitalized can we give them convalescent plasma uh to prevent hospitalization and then there are two other trials for for uh mildly ill and and severely ill patients um looking at convalescent plasma there are a couple of um of sort of basic science studies that we are planning also to see the mutation rate of the virus to see the immune response of the virus the group from global health are actually planning uh these are more uh biological and immunological studies than than therapeutic studies so we have you know quite a few uh clinical trials which are about to start are in the process of carrying getting irb approval uh some of the them are local trials others are multi-center so we're participating with with tough university and uh and and um and also other universities to to develop these these multi-center uh trials thank you so much so i'm going to ask a couple questions about testing and screening um one of the questions from uh from somebody ackman also somebody in clovis given results in new england journal of medicine regarding pregnant patients should all pregnant and patients be screened for cobit 19. yeah i think this is a really powerful story uh uh obviously the the right answer you have to know what's going on in your community you're not gonna test uh all pregnant females if there's no community outbreak in in your area but if you're in an area where there is like you know widespread community transmission um it's probably based on these evidence it's probably a good idea to test in order to protect yourself i mean your your team your healthcare workers and and also know that that the that the mother is it's a copy positive and takes some actions regarding the the newborn also so i think it does makes make some sense uh but we have to see the the prevalence of the disease in the community the availability of resources the the including the tests the swaps to make up you know a more precise decision regarding regarding this uh this strategy sorry about that thank you nestor um do you i know that our department of health colleagues aren't on today but do you can you go over the latest criteria in new mexico for testing you you want me to go over yeah no i'm just saying i don't marla's not on today but if you if you can go over that that would be great yeah i think uh the the most uh like important criteria is symptomatic patient patients who have symptoms suggestive of covet including some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia or loss of sense of taste may trigger the need for the test they have also increased the number of or or increased the indication to certain situations where there's a congregation of people like uh in prisons jail nursing homes you can do testing even in asymptomatic patients those are the general guidelines um obviously the department of health um when they're doing an investigation of an outbreak they they also have some um you know flexibility in doing the test to the contacts and people around them but but it's really symptomatic patients and um in places where there is congregation of people like like nursing home jails and other and other instances where there's there's a lot of people living together thank you very much and a couple of other i know that i'm not sure if you know the answer to this but um one of the questions from uh albuquerque as well as is there any rapid testing in new mexico and i know we talked about this a little bit on monday and we don't have carissa un unfortunately on the line but if you if you want to speak to that nester yeah i can tell you what i know i mean i've been in so many zooms meetings at different levels that i have some information obviously not final thing but i know the the a person from the state lab commented that the state was receiving 30 able machines these are the 15 minutes uh rapid testing machines and they're going to distribute it mostly to like rural hospitals or areas where they don't have ready access to to testing so that was really good news they still don't have enough of the reagents or the cartridges that this machine use but they're going to receive more in the next few days if they haven't received it so so yes we're going to have some of this rapid testing obviously only 30 so far but 30 is better than zero so we're going to have some places especially in the highly affected areas that are going to have access to to this test i know also that we at unmh probably will get uh cartridges for the gene expert which is which is a relatively rapid test it's not like 15 minutes but it gives you an answer in less than less than an hour uh so we may be able to have that test available and that is important because we have seen cases for instance patients who come and need like emerging surgery or delivery or they're going to deliver a baby or they need some acute intervention and they may have symptoms objective for kobe they may have you know a little bit of cough or fever and but they they have another medical problem like an acute mi or they need emerging appendectomy and and it's good to to have a test so you can rapidly triage those patients okay they have some respiratory system but they're called negative so you can go ahead and do the procedure and don't waste uh you know uh ppe etc so i think there's a place and we are gonna get the rapid test and before and before i get asked there's also uh in development the the serologic test and they said that in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks uh we're gonna have a serologic test to detect igg i don't know how i mean at the beginning they're gonna probably have a learning curve and and they're going to be increasing their capacity initially will be restricted somehow um as it happened with this pcr base test at the beginning that it was available but very limited but i think in a matter of several weeks we'll probably be able to have this or logic test also more readily available across across the state which is good news uh because when the when the search passes we really want to know how many people what percentage of the population was affected and it's going to be important for like returning back to work see if you're if you have been exposed or not and other interventions that i think serological tests may have some useful usefulness thank you nestor and just as a reminder to those everyone next monday david grenache who's leading the um serologic testing at tricor is going to be on so he can give us an update about where we're at with zerologic testing thank you over to you joanna thank you so much carla i wanted to let you know also um that uh uh elizabeth uh rosenbaum who uh runs uh the former united blood services now by talent is uh is willing to come on and talk about uh the serology and um the you know plot plasma um ex you know plasma exchange um nester that probably in the next week or two so that would be a help as well um i i wanted to know if um uh diane gassin or teresa chavez was on the line if they wanted to unmute and ask their question about um about immunity after being infected are you are are you are either of you on the line diane or teresa okay um and i wondered if peggy spencer was on the line dr spencer okay peggy sorry hey peggy hey there you are i saw you earlier good to see you um do you want to ask your you had a couple of really good questions everyone's questions are great i wanted to see if you might want to answer your questions directly i don't remember what they were um they were about the um the advising patients to um you know if they are symptomatic at home covet positive getting in a prone position would you like to ask oh yeah oh yeah um because i'd heard about proning being used in the hospital so i was just wondering about advising people at home whether that's a good idea for them at home to keep if that's if there's any evidence that that helps it keep it from progressing yeah that's a great question and i haven't seen any publication for for data at home but i have been in several um presentations where experts icu experts from especially from the east coast are are uh you know relating that patients especially in the icu when they are placed on the prone position they improve their oxygenation and it has to do with with several factors with the with the blood flow within the lungs at the location of the the most affected areas and the lungs of brony seems to be helping i saw also and this was just a slide in one of the experts that actually mentioned that they were doing voluntary prone in the in the emergency department and in the in the general awards because of the same reason because we have used prone in before in icus and intubated patient but they are suggesting that there's probably uh also benefit of doing it outside icu i guess like in in the emergency room or general wars i haven't seen anything at home for that it would be interesting to to do a study and see because it's relatively simple i mean you can do it with a pulse oximeter and measure if the oxygenation improves but i have seen that i haven't seen any literature just as i said expert opinion part of presentations uh but i haven't seen any written like you know like a recommendation to actually implement prone on on patient but it's really a good question and i think it's not difficult to answer that question because you can you can do a before and after with with the pulse oximeter and see if actually patients improve by changing the position voluntarily thank you so much dr spencer um dr sosa i i'm wondering if you might be able to address this a little bit one of uh our our colleagues dr strumminger sent us a um just uh just some email uh literature this morning about delaying um putting someone on a ventilator because it might not be as useful as we had once thought um can you can you kind of uh critique that and kind of say what you think about that yeah again i want to say the disclaimer that i'm not an icu person and this is not my my strength but i have seen uh the comments going back and forth in the icu community um some people claim that that we're probably uh intubating people too early and and that actually ventilatory support may be damaging for the lungs in some cases um but i have seen the other the other comment also because if you delay intubation and you have to do it on an emergency basis because the patient is really short of breath they can even go into cardiac arrest and be a more difficult integration so so i i mean i i'm not going to say in i'm going to not going to be on one side or the other i think we need to look at the evidence and actually ask the experts from icu what is the latest on that on that but i know it's a concern uh and it's a difficult decision because when you have a patient that it's you know having trouble breathing and you're actually uh agonizing over should i intubate him and it's every day in all hospitals uh that decision is made and it's a difficult one because you know that that the mortality once they're intubated it's very high in some in some publications 50 others have seen up to 80 percent mortality once they they developed the ards the cytokine storm and go into a into a mechanical support so i think the jury is still out is the ventilator you know more makes more harm than good um it's really difficult to tell at this stage thank you great thank you i wanted to see if um if lisa cope is on if she would like to ask her question it came through the chat but i just wanted just to give a little bit more context and explain the question a little bit more lisa if you cannot meet yourself okay yes yeah i know but at least is one of the uh administrators here but uh my name is rajeev patel i'm a pulmonary intensivist at uh rehoboth hospital and gallup and we have a 54 year old uh woman who is chronic dialysis who's now trached after spending i think 18 days um uh with an endotracheal tube and she's doing actually quite well minimal event support but uh the quest so her third swab was negative we did a confirmatory uh after 24-hour interval that came back positive so i was gonna check a fifth uh after one week but i'm just kind of making that up um and i i don't know what other people are doing when you've got a negative and the confirmatory turns positive can you speak to that yes yeah that's very difficult and let me just give sort of a more general perspective i mean what we are measuring with this pcr it's rna it's the presence of rna in the in the respiratory secretion not actually unfortunately we don't have a sensitive enough tool to to measure infecting virus we're just measuring a section of the virus the rna and we know for instance if we use the analogy of tuberculosis people who are treated and no longer infections may still have dna of the of the bacilli for weeks or months in the respiratory secretions and that doesn't mean that they transmit uh so something similar may be happening with this virus we are detecting intermittently especially in patients that have had like a a really complicated course and we've seen this in the literature that they persist positive or they are intermittently positive do that means that they are transmitting the disease because they have uh the presence of the virus in their i mean the presence of the rna of the virus we do not know the there is a german study in which they actually tried to culture the virus they use cells to culture the virus and they were not able to culture any virus if there were less than 10 to the six so one million copies of rna after below that threshold they were not able to co to culture in cells the virus so so we know that that that rna is probably much more sensitive uh to detect rna than to detect infectious virus so so it's it's a difficult question in that case if the patient is going home um i wouldn't have any problem you know sending the person home but if it is with a tracheostomy it's going to like like a skill nor facility then you you really have to follow the cdc recommendation of having two consecutive uh negative uh rnas but but i still i don't think we're do we are sure that that is necessary and we'll probably learn more when we do you know other epidemiological studies with these patients who are discharged they actually still infection my feeling is that once the patient has you know neutralizing antibodies and and are clinically improving and are not coughing on a fever even if they have rna in their respiratory secretion they're probably not as infectious as they were in the first five days based on the data that we know from from some of the cruise ships and that they have done cultures and and also pcr and this german study that i mentioned um that that was also very well designed although it was really small but very well designed in which they were not able to culture buyers after certain days of disease progression thank you nestor and an important question just came through the chat was sort of related to this can you review which patient should have or might need a confirmatory testing or sequential testing can you talk a little bit about that yeah i think the the main indication if the person is not going to be discharged home but it's going to a to a facility where there is more you know more people living together um that that some centers are are asking for a negative actually two consecutive negative uh tests separated by 24 hours if the patient or the person is going to go home and can be isolated at home i think that there's no need for him to be negative as long as he's following the isolation the home isolation rules and and preventing their relatives to be being exposed to the buyers so i think that's that's uh the the the i think the general rule that they are they are asking for that if they're going to be transferred to another facility or to a rehab or or some skill nor facility that they are negative but otherwise otherwise uh if they're going to go home they can go home because we are sending people with positive copied home if they don't have any symptoms so that's that's essentially the the issue here thank you and you know i think that a little bit of the confusion is about the the use of the word confirmatory because it sounds like you have one test and then you have a confirmation test but but you're just talking about the one pcr test correct correct yeah they're the same test done twice it's just because of the intermittency of the positive test that's what they they ask for two consecutive i mean probably if you do three maybe the third is positive but the rule says two if you have two negative you're you're good to go um with the information that we have and follow in cdc recommendation but again you know we're probably overdoing it we probably you know in a patient who's 21 28 days into their illness and they have clear the secretion clear the x-ray they are a fever they're not coughing you know the chances that they are transmitting it's small not zero but probably small from what we have seen in this in the published story so far thank you nestor and i'm going to ask a couple of questions about immunity and transmission there was a question that came through the chat about if a mom has copied 19 is she can she breastfeed her baby yeah i think uh uh you know breastfeeding is okay uh the problem is i mean there's no evidence of transmission through through the milk the problem is also also the the close proximity of the baby to the mother so there's there's it's not just the breastfeeding itself the the milk itself as a as a way to transmit is the the proximity of the mother to the child that puts a risk to this to this baby so it's really a difficult difficult uh question to answer in the in the practical sense thank you and i know that um there's not a clear answer to this yet but can you just talk about what we know about people who are and how what their immunity is like after their if people are immune after they get infected right yeah that's a that's a great question you're right we don't have a definitive answer and i'm gonna just mention several things we know uh we have some experience with before i mean we have the endemic coronavirus and we have stars and mirrors what we know from the from the old coronaviruses from the endemic coronavirus that are associated with common cold people do develop immunity but the immunity doesn't last too long it lasts you know for months maybe a couple of years and then it goes down because we know that these coronaviruses actually come back every few years and they actually alternate there's one coronavirus circulating and the others are suppressed then the following year you have another coronavirus and so on and so forth so we know that coronavirus in general induces immunity when when when a person is infected we know that there's immunity also to stars and tumors in there are patients who had sars in way in the in you know 20 years ago and they had some detectable immunity so if this virus is going to behave the same we are going to have some degree of immunity regarding kobe 19 specifically you know we know we don't know too much about it but we know that there are patients who recover that have neutralizing antibodies because that's actually the marker that we're using or one of the markers that we're using to to uh to select convalescent plasma to use as treatment that the person have titles of neutralizing antibodies neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent cells in the laboratory from being infected there are there are sort of protective antibodies um because they attack the virus they attach to to a very important part of the virus which is a spike protein and prevent the virus from entering the cell so it is safe to assume that is if a person recovers and develops this neutralizing antibodies that person should be protected well we don't know really it's it's how long those those um protective antibodies are gonna last it's gonna be you know six months a year two years we do not know because you know this virus is only four or five months old um so we don't really know what the effect on the on the immune system and the same goes for the vaccine if a successful vaccine is developed we don't know if we're going to have to use it every couple of years every year like influenza because we don't really know what the need is going to be and there's also the possibility of some uh mutation and evolution of the virus the virus under the pressure of of the immune system may have uh mutations in their spike protein and other important parts of the viral may change over time when they're circulating in you know in thousands and thousands of human beings there may be some changes in the virus and we may need to reformulate the vaccine or people may need to have a different um or may have a second infection at some point in the in the in the future if the virus mutates a lot so those are all you know interesting things but we still don't know the definitive answer for most of those of those questions and that is something that that uh you know makes public health uh officials worry because we can have you know circulation of disaster for a longer period of time we have second wave we may need a uh reformulation of accidents when they are available etc so it's it's it's tough i mean the future is too complicated thank you um this is joanna here um i was wondering if octavia had a chat question and i'm wondering if she's on the line if she might be able to unmute for us and ask um her question yes i'm here a physician approached me this morning we definitely are for those patients under investigation and um covet 19 patients using the proper ppe he he said recently acog released something that says that we should wear the ppe and n95s for all second stage i looked on the site i could not find anything for everyone because of the new study out saying that so many people walk around asymptomatic and could actually have it and because second stage they're pushing the amount of aerosols in the air so i was wondering if anybody else heard anything no i haven't heard about that but i can tell you what we are doing here in um unm and and and i agree i mean there is there are uh some evidence that this virus can survive in the air we know that there are experiments in which they have they have actually taken samples from the air of in rooms of patients and they are able to find the virus there we know that there are some procedures that generate aerosols um like intubation cpr and relationship and other natural which in theory can contain the virus but then again the the measures that we recommend um because the main transmission mode is actually through droplets so to large droplet or direct contact with patients um most of the most of the contacts with patients are done with just contact precautions and and droplet precautions you don't need to use the n95 in all the situations when you are near one of these patients unless unless the patient is um you know a mechanical ventilation or they have they are going to undergo a procedure that generates aerosols because we know although in theory uh there could be uh you know viral particles in the air the chances and and the practical chances are are really small and and we gather these from from you know for instance uh the healthcare workers mo a lot of the haircut workers that get infected is because they're not using any ppe or or they didn't put a mask on the patient or actually they got in the community not necessarily because they were using contact precautions um so that's what the recommendation the general use of contact precaution and there's also another reality and it's the limited amount of n95 mass uh so you have to use it when really need it if you have a limited amount it's just a rational thing to do to use and only when when you are at high risk of being exposed to aerosol as opposed to you know in all contacts with patients that you put into you that you need so are you putting not just general ma mass on all patients during second stage um yeah i don't know if you can clarify what do you mean by second second stage when and when it's time to deliver because that's when we get all the pushing and grunting and all the interesting things we do i haven't been to the labor and delivery i will defer that question to maybe the infection control colleagues um because i i don't know what what type of pp they're using inside the the labor and delivery room here at unm uh yeah and i don't mean those that's tested positive or under suspicion i see allen waving but here if you can answer i'm listening i've also a physician a retired physician uh i have not found a publication a medical publication but i can tell you that it is now a common practice in all obstetrical units along the east coast in all women active in active second stage labor or if coughing are currently having a routine surgical mass placed on them okay uh no as to my knowledge no one's putting n95 on patients the last time that was recommended was by dr scars at the very start of this and that's now been retracted n95s are reserved for individuals who are in situations where there's definite um you know you're working on a definite positive we're just too short of 95's of importance there is an article that showed up in archives internal medicine a letter from april the 8th i believe that has subsequently been debunked that was a small chinese study suggesting that there was no significant difference between folks wearing a mask and coughing that study has been debunked because there was no negative control what they did in that case is they put out small containers of viral transport media they had patients cough as a positive control they found roughly uh 10 to the third log base 10 to the third to 10 to the fourth number of viruses from just open coughing these were active covenant patients four of them and they put on a mask and they had them cough and surprisingly they had very little difference in the number of organisms found what that ultimately proved they did not do a negative control what that proved is that after you cough there are a lot of particles that continue to stay in the atmosphere so without a negative control that that study failed but the general understanding is that a routine surgical mask does significantly decrease the number of virus particles that can transmit out especially in large droplet it's not going to stop things that are smaller than 5 microns we don't believe that most of the viruses coming out of individuals as they cough are that small so definitely i think the strong recommendation currently is that routine surgical mass either procedure type or tie type should be placed on women as they move into active labor and begin breathing heavily okay that's the current recommendation that i've seen that's the current practice thank thanks dr caro thank you and thank you octavia can't pronounce it thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much um dr sosa i'm going to move on to one more question and give it back to carla if a person is exposed to someone with uh who's covet positive when when might you test that person if they become sick when might you test that person or might you not test that person how long would it take uh for a test to become positive in general the first i mean it depends on the strategy are you using uh if the person is asymptomatic and it's not within one of the recommended protocols you don't have to test them but you have to instruct the patient to uh to to enter a quarantine of 14 days to prevent in case they develop the disease to transmit it to others usually the incubation period for this disease is around five days and we know that probably 48 hours before the symptoms are present patients uh start to to uh to disseminate or may disseminate the virus so you know the testing it's it's indicated really when they develop symptoms most of the time so but but we know from from studies that were done especially with the cruise ships affected um that there were people who excreted the virus two days before they actually developed symptoms and we know now for more from more recent studies that there are there are patients who develop who do not develop symptoms they're actually uh pcr positive and as i said with the study with the pregnant females that was a proportion of seven to one so seven um to one more frequent uh asymptomatic shedding than actually symptomatic setting in those in those uh labor and delivery uh patients or patients at the end of the of the of pregnancy so so there's definitely a lot of asymptomatic excretions but the moment for testing is when you develop symptoms based on the on the current recommendation unless there's another um you know factor that makes you tested earlier if the person is in a nursing home or or within another uh situation when there's a lot of people in the same physical space thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually ask one of my dear colleagues robert gish to unmute himself and ask the question about iga all right thanks these echo sessions have been fantastic nestor carla the rest of your team i really appreciate being involved that i shaved today so i could turn on my video just so you know i was off before um i've been very interested in the antibodies uh nestor and the rest of the team here about this whole issue about protection immune status neutralizing antibodies etc i keep reading more information at iga as a secretory antibody for gi and lung may be absolutely critical and are we testing for iga what proof do we have that iga may be protective should all the new tests come out including abbott came out with a test today for covid hiv hepatitis b hepatitis c that was released and covered on the lay press today anyway so iga is the main question thank you yeah unfortunately robert i haven't i haven't seen anything there's a good story and i'm trying to remember uh where was it published out of china in which they and i think the title is like immune reaction or immune uh uh response to copy 19 in which they detail um the different antibodies that are produced obviously secretory iga should be key to decreased uh infectivity and transmission but i haven't seen any any anything specific about that nor have i seen any any uh tests that involve iga most of them that i've seen are igg rgm combination not actually iga so it would be really interesting to see if there any but i haven't seen any i'm going to actually look into into that and review that article from the chinese to see if they actually measure i think they mentioned something about idea but i'm i'm not sure because i don't remember out of the top of my head the details of the of the measurement uh quest is going to have a soft roll out of an antibody test and i've asked them or advised them to add iga to that panel so expect here's something from quests in the next 48 to 72 hours great thank you to both of you um i just wanted to to let everybody know that the cme link for the session is now in the chat box again you have to copy it and paste it into your own web browser but it's it's sometimes hard to see because it gets lost in all the questions but um it came in there from elena martinez so you can take a look at that and i'll ask another question mr um there was a couple more questions well actually i'm going to ask a sort of big picture question which i know you don't know the answer to but you can at least give us your opinion there are several um there are several questions just about when we anticipate our peak in cases in new mexico and also a question about if you know of any plans for new mexico to join other states for development of sort of a reopening plan after the shut this shutdown you're right i don't know the answers to this question no just kidding i'm going to give you my opinion no actually uh yeah i've seen a couple of models there's a model that have been developed by uh by the um by a group that is actually advising the governor and and you know this mother had been moving and they they they seem to be expecting a peak in the middle of may that's what i heard and there are different type of peaks depending on what intervention that what measures are are um are taken or sustained until until that point and and also the the same modeling includes different predictions regarding beds icu beds and ventilators so it's really complicated uh but at least we know that that that uh you know in in some instances the people will be you know in some of the models i've seen late april and they go all the way to middle of may and then hopefully a descent um into june um i i don't know the answer to the to the second question definitely not thank you nestor and i i this is another hard question i i think you went over testing already but uh marianne spencer was wanting to know is there any testing of healthcare workers who are asymptomatic no we're not we're not routinely testing at least here at unmh uh asymptomatic persons if they have been exposed and and exposed meaning a close contact so somebody examine a patient or spend more than a few minutes with the patient without the appropriate ppe and then we know that that person has been exposed then they go into quarantine and they have some close follow-up of symptoms but not routine testing as far as i know and until this this this um this point great thank you and one other testing question that came through we're still hearing that um around the country even symptomatic people can't get tested is that a problem here in new mexico uh you know that i don't know i i mean it's not it's not an issue here for us at the university hospital we we have been increasing and tricore has been really increasing their capacity to the point and now we get an answer in less than 24 hours sometimes even you know half a day uh we can get an answer and a and if it's uh you know recommended by one of the physicians based on the symptoms that the patient is tested so but i i cannot speak for the rest of the of the state which i know it's there are different conditions in different areas of of the state yeah i mean i know from just from from i'm talking to colleagues that the availability is is very good for testing in new mexico as far as i know and i don't know if there's anyone on the line that's having trouble getting tested getting tests but but there there are a lot of different places where people can actually get tested at this point so joanne i'm going to turn it back over to you for the last couple of questions sure um what i might just add is that i'm gonna refer people back again to the new mexico department of health covid um website and actually the state yesterday just put out a really nice interactive map that actually shows the testing sites by county as well so there's a link from health and human human services division back to department of health so there's the department of health really has a nice interactive map that you can get to about test sites and they also doing the um calls like it was a call today from the hospital association and they went over state statistics great thing thanks octavia um fantastic um i wanted to ask um uh nestor about um just in general possibly unm university of new mexico but in general um the visitor guidelines uh we're hearing a lot just nationally but also locally um what the visitor guidelines are or perhaps the the kind of strictness of um kind of no visitors being allowed can you might might be able to go over that as as far as you know no i'm sorry johanna i'm not familiar with the visitor that have been implemented by infectious control with the hospital leadership and i haven't really paid attention unfortunately i've been so busy with the you know all the other stuff that i i don't i've see i've seen very few visitors but i would wouldn't be qualified to answer that question to be honest what i can do is i can take this question and and we can ask it on friday at our covet echo um where we'll have um either megan brett or another doctor striker another hospital epidemiologist and there were a lot of good questions related to ventilators today and i want to let our participants know we also have a critical care echo every thursday from eight to nine in the morning and michelle harkins uh leads that echo and so um for those questions too those might be uh directed towards michelle and critical care questions as well i might ask one more question and james urbina from acoma wants to know about different um supplements like uh um tumeric and cucumber um and how they're being used in terms of investigational studies in terms of um il-6 suppression and immune modulation have you heard anything nestor about using some supplements and in terms of um immune suppression no unfortunately i haven't the the only thing that i have seen because i've seen many protocols from different places both in europe and here are the inclusion of of for instance vitamin c uh they're people just empirically using uh high doses vitamin c i have seen also the inclusion of zinc supplementation in the diet because we know that zinc has some uh utility in in common cold in other respiratory viruses i have seen the use of statins interestingly enough uh statins as you know has some anti-inflammatory rheologic properties and and so there there are researchers and and even a clinician using statins or maintaining statins on their on their patients as a way to decrease inflammation but i haven't seen anything on on turmeric or or or that those specific supplements as an anti-inflammatory uh but i've seen a lot a lot of things been used obviously without much support but but people are are sort of trying or testing their different uh different uh things that that you know to a certain point makes sense but but nestor but but zinc and vitamin c so some maybe some um water-soluble vitamins that are antioxidants perhaps right nestor any last minute um we have about two minutes to the top of the hour any closing statements i think the most important thing and actually want to do sort of a pitch in favor of the convalescent plasma because there are a lot of providers here at some point we're going to need um convalescent plasma to to to treat some of the patients when we're doing the clinical studies either prophylactic or therapeutic so if if if you can talk into your positive patient those who are taking care of calling patients to encourage them or their relatives that are positive to approach when the when the moment is right to approach uh you know the blood banks or the places where they donate blood and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma we would be great i hope we're probably going to have like a media advertisement to disregard but i think you know a patient to provide or provided to patient uh recommendation or suggestion is so powerful so so i would definitely encourage if if you if you are treating patients with kobe that that are uh you know minimally symptomatic or doing well at home if you can ask them at some point when when vitalan and the red cross are ready to receive them which is going to be very soon to actually to actually do it because we're going to need a lot of convalescent plasma um and and that would be that would be you know a good a good um thing to do to help the patients thank you so much nestor we're right at the top of the hour so thanks again everyone for joining um we just as a reminder the cme link is in this uh is in the chat box and multiple times now if you can go in there and copy it and um joanna mentioned our other echoes but we do have four out of the five days of the week have covered related echoes and you can learn you can find out more about them on our website into the code 19 page so thank you so much everyone for joining and we will see you hopefully soon joanne dr cassman yes check your email uh the society for wgyn hospitalist has put out a protocol uh strongly recommending uh masking for patients in active labor whether uh coveted positive or coveted unknown all so take a look at your email okay sure thanks you</td>\n",

       "0  okay look at your list no it's dinner i'm actually on page 29 of 35 previously we are going off of this now so i need to get rid of the rest some of it don't freak out um yes um hello everybody i'm here hey nestor it's carla good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious disease office hours we're very excited to see everybody here today and welcome to those who've been before and welcome to any new participants as well just a couple of housekeeping announcement announcements before we get started um for those of you who are familiar with project echo we really like to our one of our goals is building community and so we really like to see people's faces so if you do not have if you have a camera and don't have it on we would love for you to turn it on and keep it on during the session if possible we would ask that people keep themselves muted unless they're called on by one of the facilitators we will try as always to answer all the questions that were submitted through the registration and we will also we would also love to hear your questions on the chat so if you have a question during this session please um enter it into the chat box and we'll try to get to those as well um a couple of other things we have a digital librarian who's amazing and and during this process uh during the entire session he'll be putting some links into the chat based on questions that come in so you can always look at the chat too to find more information because of many of you know there's been a lot of security issues with zinc with um zoom lately so we can't actually put hyperlinks in the chat anymore so if you want to go to one of those links you have to copy and paste them and put them into your own web browser and lastly our website is being updated all the time with videos of the sessions and other resources so please please go to that if you want more information okay so i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm going to do a couple of introductions and then i'll ask one question then and turn it over to joanna um i want to introduce our uh office hours with nester sosa who's our chief of uh the division of infectious diseases here at the university of new mexico and he is generously offered his to do this three times a week so we really appreciate it and he's been busy sort of on the front lines and has a lot of good information so nestor i'll have you introduce yourself in just a minute and just give us a little update on anything that you think is important for the group to know and i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and we work closely together she'll be helping to moderate the question question and answer section so nestor why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and please say a few words if you will sure thank you thank you very much carla and thank thank you everybody for one more time connecting and sending those uh excellent questions i think um really on the on the research front we we're starting to see um a couple of publications um a little bit you know debunking the the hope that we have with hydroxychloroquine there was a publication from brazil that actually showed uh increased toxicity when they use the the original molecule the chloroquine molecule especially cardiac toxicity and there is a pre-publication that is going to come out in the british medical journal of probably one of the first comparative trial of hydroxyl chloroquine versus control or placebo and it showed no benefit um and these were close to 180 181 subjects so so i think um we're probably going to be looking into other uh other uh products like rendezvous or maybe the convalescent plasma as some hope for for uh for a useful therapeutic intervention but i think soon we're going to have to be revising the recommendations and and protocols in many of the centers um here in the us uh in you know in view of these uh these results and then we you know continue to follow the very closely the the development of the literature and the scientific uh publications over thank you investor and i wanted to introduce one more person um i wanted to introduce you all to juanita barapa she's a medical director of medicaid here in new mexico and i just wanted to see if she had any announcements from medicaid or hsd that she would like to just share with us today juanita thank you oh hi good uh good afternoon everyone uh i want to thank uh practical and uh faculty you know assist us in learning subject together and medicaid we're trying to take advantage of uh other i shouldn't set advantage but we want to take a full cap capability that the federal government assistance to the state in terms of uh you know the waivers and uh the new way to do business via telehealth or telemedicine and telephone so um hsd and um medical assistant division working around the clock trying to keep up with all these uh blanket waivers to try to bring the uh the um the benefits to the state so i'd like to thank everyone you know hard work and also education to take care of our members thank you so much juanita so i'm going to just ask one question then i'll turn it over to joanna um nestor there's been a lot of questions over the last couple of weeks about masks and um one of the questions from today was does wearing a mask outside make sense and one you know there was a question last week uh last on monday that i don't think we got to that someone asked a very similar thing that these masks aren't masks that that protects you from viruses basically they're not homemade masks or cloth masks and so what does does it make sense what is the reason for wearing them right now yeah that's an excellent question and in fact to be honest at the beginning of the epidemic i didn't see any sense in the general public using mask but with the mounting evidence on especially on asymptomatic transmission or pre-symptomatic transmission it makes makes sense to use a mask more than anything to prevent youth infecting other people so it's actually because there are patients or or subjects that contract this infection and do not develop any symptoms but they can infect their their um co-workers or persons around them it makes sense to wear a mask because that contains to a certain degree the the respiratory droplets the saliva when you cough when you talk so it's more than anything to protect other people than to protect yourself because we know that a simple cloth mask or even a surgical mask is not 100 protective for you um for infection if there are aerosols in the air that contain the virus but on the other hand you are definitely limiting the spread of your respiratory secretions if you wear a mask in public so i think um it makes sense now to to to use that recommendation especially if you're going to be if you're going to go to the grocery store to the supermarket or to any place where you're going to be close to other people in order to protect them it's reasonable to wear a mask and we have seen this in in you know videos and and uh news from from from japan and china that they use it all the time even before the kobe my team was uh discover or prevalent so so now it really really makes sense on the current uh you know information that we have about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transition which is which is pretty um uh pretty significant i mean i just i just saw an article uh yesterday um and published in the new england journal about they actually tested over 200 pregnant females that went to the labor and delivery room and they found that 13 of them had asymptomatic viral shedding as opposed to one point something so it's seven times more frequent to have a young uh person treating the virus without even having symptoms uh than than symptoms so so asymptomatic transmission it's it's it's been appreciated more and more so that it makes sense just to wear a mask to protect others under those conditions thank you thank you nestor thanks carla this is joanna katzman here um i'm going to nestor if it's okay i'm gonna start with some treatment questions but i did want to let everybody know you might have seen the slide before the session and on the chat about the new um cdc covered 19 clinical call center it opened five days ago it's a 24 7 call center for clinicians and um health departments and a close colleague of mine is is manning it and she is referring clinicians actually to our echoes here um as well but she asked me to um let you you all know that this call center is for clinicians um and health departments if they have any urgent questions it i think it is being manned by physicians and advanced practice providers and they're giving cdc guidance and and particular questions so i think it's a really good um thing to know about if you have any urgent questions day and night and maybe to take a little load off of nestor on the pals call 24 7 too so the first question is um is ivermectin nester being explored for treatment after um some studies have shown um some in vitro studies have shown the inhibition of viral rna transcription there has been i know some studies on ivermectin right there is uh at least evidence in vitro that that hybrid mechanism also inhibits the virus there are actually a lot of of uh molecules being considered for clinical trials um i actually reviewed a paper in in journal that actually mentioned over 300 research protocols are being conducted at this moment in the united states and other countries looking for different interventions pharmacologic and otherwise intervention for copic night team i don't know if there's a specific protocol already for hybrid mechan but i wouldn't be surprised because there are many many molecules that have um either immunomodulator effect or direct antiviral that are being evaluated in different clinical trials either alone or in combination uh but but to my knowledge i i haven't really seen a protocol on either mechan um yet but i wouldn't be surprised to be honest thank you um and uh we might have uh touched on this last week but might you touch on it again your thoughts related to the uh timing of remdissevere and this other um immune modulating drug i'm i'm gonna not pronounce it right but uh t-o-l-i-c-i-z-u-m-a-b yeah the toss-illissum yes and and and you know because we we don't have uh well uh randomized control trials everything that i'm going to say sort of in analogy to what we know from other viral infections in general um you know this this viral infection and kobe 19 is not an exception it's actually pretty typical uh there is a component that the virus um that is it's it's the fault of the virus it's virus directed inflammation but then there's an uncontrolled immune response uh and and damaging immune response that also uh activates the coagulation cascade uh activate the cytokine storm so we have sort of uh you know two two phases to this disease that the viral and the immunologic i think for in general for antivirals to work they need to be used earlier so i wouldn't be surprised if most of the study points to our earlier rather than late uh efficacy for these drugs so if you use a antiviral probably late in the second week when the patient is already in icu it's probably going to be very hard to show efficacy uh and so so in general i think and this is true with influenza the earlier you use the antiviral the the better uh chance the patient have to to to have a good recovery or or or or do not advance to more severe disease on the other hand there are some drugs that have been or that i have that they are being considered in the in the more advanced patients and toscilisumati is an example because toscilicium it's a it's a it's an inhibitor of il-6 one of the cytokines that are elevated uh in the cytokine storm that this patient experienced so i think some of those immune modulators may be more useful in a sub-population of patients that actually have this severe inflammatory state um on the other hand there's there's mounting evidence that probably early anti-population something like low molecular weight heparin prophylactically maybe it may be useful in hospitalized patients so so you know we are learning a lot but i think if anything antivirals and including convalescent plasma are going to be useful if anything at the beginning early in the disease uh more than really late um and and some others may maybe still have some usefulness late but it will be mostly in the immune modulator uh or trying to quiet down the immune system at the end to prevent the excess inflammation excess correlation etc thanks mister i think you answered a couple of the questions under the treatment someone else i that dr urbina from akama asked kind of how would you suggest using low resource how would you suggest low resource institutions or kind of maybe critical access hospitals modulate this cytokine storm to prevent this moderate to severe disease but i think you answered that you gave a lot of kind of ideas in that in that sense um let me ask you one more question then i'll turn it over to carla is there any proof that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be gifted be given has that been disproven nestor right there is no evidence one way or the other at the beginning there was a general sort of a blanket recommendation from wa show and i think an official in france uh who actually a health official in france france who said that they were somewhat contra indicated um but i haven't seen any solid evidence in favor or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs what i say all the time if you use it for just fever control it's probably better to use a safer drug like like acetaminophen or paracetamol paracetamol at this point because we have no evidence of efficacy or or toxicity um and and there are some uh studies that that the non-steroidal may increase the number of receptors the h2 receptor so the i think until we have solid evidence i would say if you if you have a fever and you're at home with the kovid just take acetaminophen if you need to take anything uh for the fever um as opposed to to nonsteroidal until we really learn with more solid evidence if they are uh deleterious or or or if they help in any way thank you nestor before we move away from the treatment questions do you um can you just give an update about what uh clinical trials are going on at unm sure yeah we have several of them uh we have a uh one of the earliest trials that we started was the hydroxychromoquin combined with acetomycin right after we saw the the study from the french and the endorsement of the fda for for this combination we started an open label trial for patients and and we have been using hydroxychromic when combined with acetomycin in some of the patients that are in icu this is an open label study so we're probably not going to learn a lot from it i mean we have the some patients that did not use that combination so we will have at least historical controls uh but as i said it's just a it's an open label study mostly um directed towards allowing us access to the drugs um but now that we are sort of accumulating evidence of probably the the inefficacy or or or lack of efficacy of uh hydroxychloroquine and in fact some issues about toxicity because there's a carrier toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin also has the same uh problem with the prolongation of the qtc the the qtc segment in the ekg which is associated with some uh really dangerous ventricular arrhythmias so so we're probably going to move away from those drugs and then we are actually discussing them on each other about that that trial there's also uh we are in the planning stages of using convalescent plasma which is the other tool and we in fact we have we are applying to four different protocols one protocol in prophylaxis let's say a person like a family member close family member of a copy patient the question is can can that person receive plasma and prevent the disease from from uh from establishing itself so there's a there's a pulse exposure prophylaxis and also for a healthcare worker exposed so we have we are working on on starting that trial for possible exposure prophylaxis there's another trial for ambulatory patients patients that that are test positive but they are um not sick enough to be hospitalized can we give them convalescent plasma uh to prevent hospitalization and then there are two other trials for for uh mildly ill and and severely ill patients um looking at convalescent plasma there are a couple of um of sort of basic science studies that we are planning also to see the mutation rate of the virus to see the immune response of the virus the group from global health are actually planning uh these are more uh biological and immunological studies than than therapeutic studies so we have you know quite a few uh clinical trials which are about to start are in the process of carrying getting irb approval uh some of the them are local trials others are multi-center so we're participating with with tough university and uh and and um and also other universities to to develop these these multi-center uh trials thank you so much so i'm going to ask a couple questions about testing and screening um one of the questions from uh from somebody ackman also somebody in clovis given results in new england journal of medicine regarding pregnant patients should all pregnant and patients be screened for cobit 19. yeah i think this is a really powerful story uh uh obviously the the right answer you have to know what's going on in your community you're not gonna test uh all pregnant females if there's no community outbreak in in your area but if you're in an area where there is like you know widespread community transmission um it's probably based on these evidence it's probably a good idea to test in order to protect yourself i mean your your team your healthcare workers and and also know that that the that the mother is it's a copy positive and takes some actions regarding the the newborn also so i think it does makes make some sense uh but we have to see the the prevalence of the disease in the community the availability of resources the the including the tests the swaps to make up you know a more precise decision regarding regarding this uh this strategy sorry about that thank you nestor um do you i know that our department of health colleagues aren't on today but do you can you go over the latest criteria in new mexico for testing you you want me to go over yeah no i'm just saying i don't marla's not on today but if you if you can go over that that would be great yeah i think uh the the most uh like important criteria is symptomatic patient patients who have symptoms suggestive of covet including some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia or loss of sense of taste may trigger the need for the test they have also increased the number of or or increased the indication to certain situations where there's a congregation of people like uh in prisons jail nursing homes you can do testing even in asymptomatic patients those are the general guidelines um obviously the department of health um when they're doing an investigation of an outbreak they they also have some um you know flexibility in doing the test to the contacts and people around them but but it's really symptomatic patients and um in places where there is congregation of people like like nursing home jails and other and other instances where there's there's a lot of people living together thank you very much and a couple of other i know that i'm not sure if you know the answer to this but um one of the questions from uh albuquerque as well as is there any rapid testing in new mexico and i know we talked about this a little bit on monday and we don't have carissa un unfortunately on the line but if you if you want to speak to that nester yeah i can tell you what i know i mean i've been in so many zooms meetings at different levels that i have some information obviously not final thing but i know the the a person from the state lab commented that the state was receiving 30 able machines these are the 15 minutes uh rapid testing machines and they're going to distribute it mostly to like rural hospitals or areas where they don't have ready access to to testing so that was really good news they still don't have enough of the reagents or the cartridges that this machine use but they're going to receive more in the next few days if they haven't received it so so yes we're going to have some of this rapid testing obviously only 30 so far but 30 is better than zero so we're going to have some places especially in the highly affected areas that are going to have access to to this test i know also that we at unmh probably will get uh cartridges for the gene expert which is which is a relatively rapid test it's not like 15 minutes but it gives you an answer in less than less than an hour uh so we may be able to have that test available and that is important because we have seen cases for instance patients who come and need like emerging surgery or delivery or they're going to deliver a baby or they need some acute intervention and they may have symptoms objective for kobe they may have you know a little bit of cough or fever and but they they have another medical problem like an acute mi or they need emerging appendectomy and and it's good to to have a test so you can rapidly triage those patients okay they have some respiratory system but they're called negative so you can go ahead and do the procedure and don't waste uh you know uh ppe etc so i think there's a place and we are gonna get the rapid test and before and before i get asked there's also uh in development the the serologic test and they said that in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks uh we're gonna have a serologic test to detect igg i don't know how i mean at the beginning they're gonna probably have a learning curve and and they're going to be increasing their capacity initially will be restricted somehow um as it happened with this pcr base test at the beginning that it was available but very limited but i think in a matter of several weeks we'll probably be able to have this or logic test also more readily available across across the state which is good news uh because when the when the search passes we really want to know how many people what percentage of the population was affected and it's going to be important for like returning back to work see if you're if you have been exposed or not and other interventions that i think serological tests may have some useful usefulness thank you nestor and just as a reminder to those everyone next monday david grenache who's leading the um serologic testing at tricor is going to be on so he can give us an update about where we're at with zerologic testing thank you over to you joanna thank you so much carla i wanted to let you know also um that uh uh elizabeth uh rosenbaum who uh runs uh the former united blood services now by talent is uh is willing to come on and talk about uh the serology and um the you know plot plasma um ex you know plasma exchange um nester that probably in the next week or two so that would be a help as well um i i wanted to know if um uh diane gassin or teresa chavez was on the line if they wanted to unmute and ask their question about um about immunity after being infected are you are are you are either of you on the line diane or teresa okay um and i wondered if peggy spencer was on the line dr spencer okay peggy sorry hey peggy hey there you are i saw you earlier good to see you um do you want to ask your you had a couple of really good questions everyone's questions are great i wanted to see if you might want to answer your questions directly i don't remember what they were um they were about the um the advising patients to um you know if they are symptomatic at home covet positive getting in a prone position would you like to ask oh yeah oh yeah um because i'd heard about proning being used in the hospital so i was just wondering about advising people at home whether that's a good idea for them at home to keep if that's if there's any evidence that that helps it keep it from progressing yeah that's a great question and i haven't seen any publication for for data at home but i have been in several um presentations where experts icu experts from especially from the east coast are are uh you know relating that patients especially in the icu when they are placed on the prone position they improve their oxygenation and it has to do with with several factors with the with the blood flow within the lungs at the location of the the most affected areas and the lungs of brony seems to be helping i saw also and this was just a slide in one of the experts that actually mentioned that they were doing voluntary prone in the in the emergency department and in the in the general awards because of the same reason because we have used prone in before in icus and intubated patient but they are suggesting that there's probably uh also benefit of doing it outside icu i guess like in in the emergency room or general wars i haven't seen anything at home for that it would be interesting to to do a study and see because it's relatively simple i mean you can do it with a pulse oximeter and measure if the oxygenation improves but i have seen that i haven't seen any literature just as i said expert opinion part of presentations uh but i haven't seen any written like you know like a recommendation to actually implement prone on on patient but it's really a good question and i think it's not difficult to answer that question because you can you can do a before and after with with the pulse oximeter and see if actually patients improve by changing the position voluntarily thank you so much dr spencer um dr sosa i i'm wondering if you might be able to address this a little bit one of uh our our colleagues dr strumminger sent us a um just uh just some email uh literature this morning about delaying um putting someone on a ventilator because it might not be as useful as we had once thought um can you can you kind of uh critique that and kind of say what you think about that yeah again i want to say the disclaimer that i'm not an icu person and this is not my my strength but i have seen uh the comments going back and forth in the icu community um some people claim that that we're probably uh intubating people too early and and that actually ventilatory support may be damaging for the lungs in some cases um but i have seen the other the other comment also because if you delay intubation and you have to do it on an emergency basis because the patient is really short of breath they can even go into cardiac arrest and be a more difficult integration so so i i mean i i'm not going to say in i'm going to not going to be on one side or the other i think we need to look at the evidence and actually ask the experts from icu what is the latest on that on that but i know it's a concern uh and it's a difficult decision because when you have a patient that it's you know having trouble breathing and you're actually uh agonizing over should i intubate him and it's every day in all hospitals uh that decision is made and it's a difficult one because you know that that the mortality once they're intubated it's very high in some in some publications 50 others have seen up to 80 percent mortality once they they developed the ards the cytokine storm and go into a into a mechanical support so i think the jury is still out is the ventilator you know more makes more harm than good um it's really difficult to tell at this stage thank you great thank you i wanted to see if um if lisa cope is on if she would like to ask her question it came through the chat but i just wanted just to give a little bit more context and explain the question a little bit more lisa if you cannot meet yourself okay yes yeah i know but at least is one of the uh administrators here but uh my name is rajeev patel i'm a pulmonary intensivist at uh rehoboth hospital and gallup and we have a 54 year old uh woman who is chronic dialysis who's now trached after spending i think 18 days um uh with an endotracheal tube and she's doing actually quite well minimal event support but uh the quest so her third swab was negative we did a confirmatory uh after 24-hour interval that came back positive so i was gonna check a fifth uh after one week but i'm just kind of making that up um and i i don't know what other people are doing when you've got a negative and the confirmatory turns positive can you speak to that yes yeah that's very difficult and let me just give sort of a more general perspective i mean what we are measuring with this pcr it's rna it's the presence of rna in the in the respiratory secretion not actually unfortunately we don't have a sensitive enough tool to to measure infecting virus we're just measuring a section of the virus the rna and we know for instance if we use the analogy of tuberculosis people who are treated and no longer infections may still have dna of the of the bacilli for weeks or months in the respiratory secretions and that doesn't mean that they transmit uh so something similar may be happening with this virus we are detecting intermittently especially in patients that have had like a a really complicated course and we've seen this in the literature that they persist positive or they are intermittently positive do that means that they are transmitting the disease because they have uh the presence of the virus in their i mean the presence of the rna of the virus we do not know the there is a german study in which they actually tried to culture the virus they use cells to culture the virus and they were not able to culture any virus if there were less than 10 to the six so one million copies of rna after below that threshold they were not able to co to culture in cells the virus so so we know that that that rna is probably much more sensitive uh to detect rna than to detect infectious virus so so it's it's a difficult question in that case if the patient is going home um i wouldn't have any problem you know sending the person home but if it is with a tracheostomy it's going to like like a skill nor facility then you you really have to follow the cdc recommendation of having two consecutive uh negative uh rnas but but i still i don't think we're do we are sure that that is necessary and we'll probably learn more when we do you know other epidemiological studies with these patients who are discharged they actually still infection my feeling is that once the patient has you know neutralizing antibodies and and are clinically improving and are not coughing on a fever even if they have rna in their respiratory secretion they're probably not as infectious as they were in the first five days based on the data that we know from from some of the cruise ships and that they have done cultures and and also pcr and this german study that i mentioned um that that was also very well designed although it was really small but very well designed in which they were not able to culture buyers after certain days of disease progression thank you nestor and an important question just came through the chat was sort of related to this can you review which patient should have or might need a confirmatory testing or sequential testing can you talk a little bit about that yeah i think the the main indication if the person is not going to be discharged home but it's going to a to a facility where there is more you know more people living together um that that some centers are are asking for a negative actually two consecutive negative uh tests separated by 24 hours if the patient or the person is going to go home and can be isolated at home i think that there's no need for him to be negative as long as he's following the isolation the home isolation rules and and preventing their relatives to be being exposed to the buyers so i think that's that's uh the the the i think the general rule that they are they are asking for that if they're going to be transferred to another facility or to a rehab or or some skill nor facility that they are negative but otherwise otherwise uh if they're going to go home they can go home because we are sending people with positive copied home if they don't have any symptoms so that's that's essentially the the issue here thank you and you know i think that a little bit of the confusion is about the the use of the word confirmatory because it sounds like you have one test and then you have a confirmation test but but you're just talking about the one pcr test correct correct yeah they're the same test done twice it's just because of the intermittency of the positive test that's what they they ask for two consecutive i mean probably if you do three maybe the third is positive but the rule says two if you have two negative you're you're good to go um with the information that we have and follow in cdc recommendation but again you know we're probably overdoing it we probably you know in a patient who's 21 28 days into their illness and they have clear the secretion clear the x-ray they are a fever they're not coughing you know the chances that they are transmitting it's small not zero but probably small from what we have seen in this in the published story so far thank you nestor and i'm going to ask a couple of questions about immunity and transmission there was a question that came through the chat about if a mom has copied 19 is she can she breastfeed her baby yeah i think uh uh you know breastfeeding is okay uh the problem is i mean there's no evidence of transmission through through the milk the problem is also also the the close proximity of the baby to the mother so there's there's it's not just the breastfeeding itself the the milk itself as a as a way to transmit is the the proximity of the mother to the child that puts a risk to this to this baby so it's really a difficult difficult uh question to answer in the in the practical sense thank you and i know that um there's not a clear answer to this yet but can you just talk about what we know about people who are and how what their immunity is like after their if people are immune after they get infected right yeah that's a that's a great question you're right we don't have a definitive answer and i'm gonna just mention several things we know uh we have some experience with before i mean we have the endemic coronavirus and we have stars and mirrors what we know from the from the old coronaviruses from the endemic coronavirus that are associated with common cold people do develop immunity but the immunity doesn't last too long it lasts you know for months maybe a couple of years and then it goes down because we know that these coronaviruses actually come back every few years and they actually alternate there's one coronavirus circulating and the others are suppressed then the following year you have another coronavirus and so on and so forth so we know that coronavirus in general induces immunity when when when a person is infected we know that there's immunity also to stars and tumors in there are patients who had sars in way in the in you know 20 years ago and they had some detectable immunity so if this virus is going to behave the same we are going to have some degree of immunity regarding kobe 19 specifically you know we know we don't know too much about it but we know that there are patients who recover that have neutralizing antibodies because that's actually the marker that we're using or one of the markers that we're using to to uh to select convalescent plasma to use as treatment that the person have titles of neutralizing antibodies neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent cells in the laboratory from being infected there are there are sort of protective antibodies um because they attack the virus they attach to to a very important part of the virus which is a spike protein and prevent the virus from entering the cell so it is safe to assume that is if a person recovers and develops this neutralizing antibodies that person should be protected well we don't know really it's it's how long those those um protective antibodies are gonna last it's gonna be you know six months a year two years we do not know because you know this virus is only four or five months old um so we don't really know what the effect on the on the immune system and the same goes for the vaccine if a successful vaccine is developed we don't know if we're going to have to use it every couple of years every year like influenza because we don't really know what the need is going to be and there's also the possibility of some uh mutation and evolution of the virus the virus under the pressure of of the immune system may have uh mutations in their spike protein and other important parts of the viral may change over time when they're circulating in you know in thousands and thousands of human beings there may be some changes in the virus and we may need to reformulate the vaccine or people may need to have a different um or may have a second infection at some point in the in the in the future if the virus mutates a lot so those are all you know interesting things but we still don't know the definitive answer for most of those of those questions and that is something that that uh you know makes public health uh officials worry because we can have you know circulation of disaster for a longer period of time we have second wave we may need a uh reformulation of accidents when they are available etc so it's it's it's tough i mean the future is too complicated thank you um this is joanna here um i was wondering if octavia had a chat question and i'm wondering if she's on the line if she might be able to unmute for us and ask um her question yes i'm here a physician approached me this morning we definitely are for those patients under investigation and um covet 19 patients using the proper ppe he he said recently acog released something that says that we should wear the ppe and n95s for all second stage i looked on the site i could not find anything for everyone because of the new study out saying that so many people walk around asymptomatic and could actually have it and because second stage they're pushing the amount of aerosols in the air so i was wondering if anybody else heard anything no i haven't heard about that but i can tell you what we are doing here in um unm and and and i agree i mean there is there are uh some evidence that this virus can survive in the air we know that there are experiments in which they have they have actually taken samples from the air of in rooms of patients and they are able to find the virus there we know that there are some procedures that generate aerosols um like intubation cpr and relationship and other natural which in theory can contain the virus but then again the the measures that we recommend um because the main transmission mode is actually through droplets so to large droplet or direct contact with patients um most of the most of the contacts with patients are done with just contact precautions and and droplet precautions you don't need to use the n95 in all the situations when you are near one of these patients unless unless the patient is um you know a mechanical ventilation or they have they are going to undergo a procedure that generates aerosols because we know although in theory uh there could be uh you know viral particles in the air the chances and and the practical chances are are really small and and we gather these from from you know for instance uh the healthcare workers mo a lot of the haircut workers that get infected is because they're not using any ppe or or they didn't put a mask on the patient or actually they got in the community not necessarily because they were using contact precautions um so that's what the recommendation the general use of contact precaution and there's also another reality and it's the limited amount of n95 mass uh so you have to use it when really need it if you have a limited amount it's just a rational thing to do to use and only when when you are at high risk of being exposed to aerosol as opposed to you know in all contacts with patients that you put into you that you need so are you putting not just general ma mass on all patients during second stage um yeah i don't know if you can clarify what do you mean by second second stage when and when it's time to deliver because that's when we get all the pushing and grunting and all the interesting things we do i haven't been to the labor and delivery i will defer that question to maybe the infection control colleagues um because i i don't know what what type of pp they're using inside the the labor and delivery room here at unm uh yeah and i don't mean those that's tested positive or under suspicion i see allen waving but here if you can answer i'm listening i've also a physician a retired physician uh i have not found a publication a medical publication but i can tell you that it is now a common practice in all obstetrical units along the east coast in all women active in active second stage labor or if coughing are currently having a routine surgical mass placed on them okay uh no as to my knowledge no one's putting n95 on patients the last time that was recommended was by dr scars at the very start of this and that's now been retracted n95s are reserved for individuals who are in situations where there's definite um you know you're working on a definite positive we're just too short of 95's of importance there is an article that showed up in archives internal medicine a letter from april the 8th i believe that has subsequently been debunked that was a small chinese study suggesting that there was no significant difference between folks wearing a mask and coughing that study has been debunked because there was no negative control what they did in that case is they put out small containers of viral transport media they had patients cough as a positive control they found roughly uh 10 to the third log base 10 to the third to 10 to the fourth number of viruses from just open coughing these were active covenant patients four of them and they put on a mask and they had them cough and surprisingly they had very little difference in the number of organisms found what that ultimately proved they did not do a negative control what that proved is that after you cough there are a lot of particles that continue to stay in the atmosphere so without a negative control that that study failed but the general understanding is that a routine surgical mask does significantly decrease the number of virus particles that can transmit out especially in large droplet it's not going to stop things that are smaller than 5 microns we don't believe that most of the viruses coming out of individuals as they cough are that small so definitely i think the strong recommendation currently is that routine surgical mass either procedure type or tie type should be placed on women as they move into active labor and begin breathing heavily okay that's the current recommendation that i've seen that's the current practice thank thanks dr caro thank you and thank you octavia can't pronounce it thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much um dr sosa i'm going to move on to one more question and give it back to carla if a person is exposed to someone with uh who's covet positive when when might you test that person if they become sick when might you test that person or might you not test that person how long would it take uh for a test to become positive in general the first i mean it depends on the strategy are you using uh if the person is asymptomatic and it's not within one of the recommended protocols you don't have to test them but you have to instruct the patient to uh to to enter a quarantine of 14 days to prevent in case they develop the disease to transmit it to others usually the incubation period for this disease is around five days and we know that probably 48 hours before the symptoms are present patients uh start to to uh to disseminate or may disseminate the virus so you know the testing it's it's indicated really when they develop symptoms most of the time so but but we know from from studies that were done especially with the cruise ships affected um that there were people who excreted the virus two days before they actually developed symptoms and we know now for more from more recent studies that there are there are patients who develop who do not develop symptoms they're actually uh pcr positive and as i said with the study with the pregnant females that was a proportion of seven to one so seven um to one more frequent uh asymptomatic shedding than actually symptomatic setting in those in those uh labor and delivery uh patients or patients at the end of the of the of pregnancy so so there's definitely a lot of asymptomatic excretions but the moment for testing is when you develop symptoms based on the on the current recommendation unless there's another um you know factor that makes you tested earlier if the person is in a nursing home or or within another uh situation when there's a lot of people in the same physical space thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually ask one of my dear colleagues robert gish to unmute himself and ask the question about iga all right thanks these echo sessions have been fantastic nestor carla the rest of your team i really appreciate being involved that i shaved today so i could turn on my video just so you know i was off before um i've been very interested in the antibodies uh nestor and the rest of the team here about this whole issue about protection immune status neutralizing antibodies etc i keep reading more information at iga as a secretory antibody for gi and lung may be absolutely critical and are we testing for iga what proof do we have that iga may be protective should all the new tests come out including abbott came out with a test today for covid hiv hepatitis b hepatitis c that was released and covered on the lay press today anyway so iga is the main question thank you yeah unfortunately robert i haven't i haven't seen anything there's a good story and i'm trying to remember uh where was it published out of china in which they and i think the title is like immune reaction or immune uh uh response to copy 19 in which they detail um the different antibodies that are produced obviously secretory iga should be key to decreased uh infectivity and transmission but i haven't seen any any anything specific about that nor have i seen any any uh tests that involve iga most of them that i've seen are igg rgm combination not actually iga so it would be really interesting to see if there any but i haven't seen any i'm going to actually look into into that and review that article from the chinese to see if they actually measure i think they mentioned something about idea but i'm i'm not sure because i don't remember out of the top of my head the details of the of the measurement uh quest is going to have a soft roll out of an antibody test and i've asked them or advised them to add iga to that panel so expect here's something from quests in the next 48 to 72 hours great thank you to both of you um i just wanted to to let everybody know that the cme link for the session is now in the chat box again you have to copy it and paste it into your own web browser but it's it's sometimes hard to see because it gets lost in all the questions but um it came in there from elena martinez so you can take a look at that and i'll ask another question mr um there was a couple more questions well actually i'm going to ask a sort of big picture question which i know you don't know the answer to but you can at least give us your opinion there are several um there are several questions just about when we anticipate our peak in cases in new mexico and also a question about if you know of any plans for new mexico to join other states for development of sort of a reopening plan after the shut this shutdown you're right i don't know the answers to this question no just kidding i'm going to give you my opinion no actually uh yeah i've seen a couple of models there's a model that have been developed by uh by the um by a group that is actually advising the governor and and you know this mother had been moving and they they they seem to be expecting a peak in the middle of may that's what i heard and there are different type of peaks depending on what intervention that what measures are are um are taken or sustained until until that point and and also the the same modeling includes different predictions regarding beds icu beds and ventilators so it's really complicated uh but at least we know that that that uh you know in in some instances the people will be you know in some of the models i've seen late april and they go all the way to middle of may and then hopefully a descent um into june um i i don't know the answer to the to the second question definitely not thank you nestor and i i this is another hard question i i think you went over testing already but uh marianne spencer was wanting to know is there any testing of healthcare workers who are asymptomatic no we're not we're not routinely testing at least here at unmh uh asymptomatic persons if they have been exposed and and exposed meaning a close contact so somebody examine a patient or spend more than a few minutes with the patient without the appropriate ppe and then we know that that person has been exposed then they go into quarantine and they have some close follow-up of symptoms but not routine testing as far as i know and until this this this um this point great thank you and one other testing question that came through we're still hearing that um around the country even symptomatic people can't get tested is that a problem here in new mexico uh you know that i don't know i i mean it's not it's not an issue here for us at the university hospital we we have been increasing and tricore has been really increasing their capacity to the point and now we get an answer in less than 24 hours sometimes even you know half a day uh we can get an answer and a and if it's uh you know recommended by one of the physicians based on the symptoms that the patient is tested so but i i cannot speak for the rest of the of the state which i know it's there are different conditions in different areas of of the state yeah i mean i know from just from from i'm talking to colleagues that the availability is is very good for testing in new mexico as far as i know and i don't know if there's anyone on the line that's having trouble getting tested getting tests but but there there are a lot of different places where people can actually get tested at this point so joanne i'm going to turn it back over to you for the last couple of questions sure um what i might just add is that i'm gonna refer people back again to the new mexico department of health covid um website and actually the state yesterday just put out a really nice interactive map that actually shows the testing sites by county as well so there's a link from health and human human services division back to department of health so there's the department of health really has a nice interactive map that you can get to about test sites and they also doing the um calls like it was a call today from the hospital association and they went over state statistics great thing thanks octavia um fantastic um i wanted to ask um uh nestor about um just in general possibly unm university of new mexico but in general um the visitor guidelines uh we're hearing a lot just nationally but also locally um what the visitor guidelines are or perhaps the the kind of strictness of um kind of no visitors being allowed can you might might be able to go over that as as far as you know no i'm sorry johanna i'm not familiar with the visitor that have been implemented by infectious control with the hospital leadership and i haven't really paid attention unfortunately i've been so busy with the you know all the other stuff that i i don't i've see i've seen very few visitors but i would wouldn't be qualified to answer that question to be honest what i can do is i can take this question and and we can ask it on friday at our covet echo um where we'll have um either megan brett or another doctor striker another hospital epidemiologist and there were a lot of good questions related to ventilators today and i want to let our participants know we also have a critical care echo every thursday from eight to nine in the morning and michelle harkins uh leads that echo and so um for those questions too those might be uh directed towards michelle and critical care questions as well i might ask one more question and james urbina from acoma wants to know about different um supplements like uh um tumeric and cucumber um and how they're being used in terms of investigational studies in terms of um il-6 suppression and immune modulation have you heard anything nestor about using some supplements and in terms of um immune suppression no unfortunately i haven't the the only thing that i have seen because i've seen many protocols from different places both in europe and here are the inclusion of of for instance vitamin c uh they're people just empirically using uh high doses vitamin c i have seen also the inclusion of zinc supplementation in the diet because we know that zinc has some uh utility in in common cold in other respiratory viruses i have seen the use of statins interestingly enough uh statins as you know has some anti-inflammatory rheologic properties and and so there there are researchers and and even a clinician using statins or maintaining statins on their on their patients as a way to decrease inflammation but i haven't seen anything on on turmeric or or or that those specific supplements as an anti-inflammatory uh but i've seen a lot a lot of things been used obviously without much support but but people are are sort of trying or testing their different uh different uh things that that you know to a certain point makes sense but but nestor but but zinc and vitamin c so some maybe some um water-soluble vitamins that are antioxidants perhaps right nestor any last minute um we have about two minutes to the top of the hour any closing statements i think the most important thing and actually want to do sort of a pitch in favor of the convalescent plasma because there are a lot of providers here at some point we're going to need um convalescent plasma to to to treat some of the patients when we're doing the clinical studies either prophylactic or therapeutic so if if if you can talk into your positive patient those who are taking care of calling patients to encourage them or their relatives that are positive to approach when the when the moment is right to approach uh you know the blood banks or the places where they donate blood and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma we would be great i hope we're probably going to have like a media advertisement to disregard but i think you know a patient to provide or provided to patient uh recommendation or suggestion is so powerful so so i would definitely encourage if if you if you are treating patients with kobe that that are uh you know minimally symptomatic or doing well at home if you can ask them at some point when when vitalan and the red cross are ready to receive them which is going to be very soon to actually to actually do it because we're going to need a lot of convalescent plasma um and and that would be that would be you know a good a good um thing to do to help the patients thank you so much nestor we're right at the top of the hour so thanks again everyone for joining um we just as a reminder the cme link is in this uh is in the chat box and multiple times now if you can go in there and copy it and um joanna mentioned our other echoes but we do have four out of the five days of the week have covered related echoes and you can learn you can find out more about them on our website into the code 19 page so thank you so much everyone for joining and we will see you hopefully soon joanne dr cassman yes check your email uh the society for wgyn hospitalist has put out a protocol uh strongly recommending uh masking for patients in active labor whether uh coveted positive or coveted unknown all so take a look at your email okay sure thanks you   \n",

      "Text: \"everybody can you hear me okay great thank you well welcome everybody to our monday office hours infectious disease echo i'm joanna katzman i want to get started right away and wanted to remind everybody that if you have a video camera and you're able to turn it on please do so it allows us to be able to see you and we can kind of see each other and it's uh more bi-directional and in line with the echo model that would be fantastic i would like to introduce my colleague carla thornton carla do you want to say hi sure thank you joanna i'm carla thornton infectious diseases here at unm thank you thanks carlin carla will be asking some questions a little in a little bit but i want to get right to we have presentations from our leader dr nester sosa who's the division chief of infectious diseases at university of new mexico um dr sosa has a presentation uh followed by that of leslie hayes and then we've got a great update from marla sivers who's one of the senior epidemiologists at the new mexico department of health um so without further ado i just wanted to let everybody know that we also have a our digital librarian kent noseworthy who's going to be putting many things in the chat and just wanted to remind everybody please do not hesitate if you have any questions um you know burning questions during the presentations from either dr sosa dr hayes or marla sivers please uh please put that in the chat so that you don't forget so dr sosa we are ready thank you thank you hello everyone let me see if i can share my screenplay in presentation mode can you see my screen really well good okay so really an exciting day for for the united states there as you know they're starting the vaccinations so i decided today to review the data the published data of the pfizer vaccine which is the one that that hopefully some of the healthcare workers and nursing home residents and employees will receive in the next few days and actually there was a lot of discussion last last week at the with the fda meeting but but we uh we're lucky to see that they publish their their data um in the new england journal on the 10th so we have access to the to the complete publication besides the report so this this trial was actually the the phase three trial with some safety information for the phase one and two and the the article is titled safety and efficacy of and this is the name of the vaccine bnt 16 162 b2 mrna covet vaccine or better known as the physical mrna vaccine this uh product is actually a lipid nanoparticle formulated with a nucleoside modified rna that encodes um the sars kobe 2 spike protein so so basically it gives the cells the information to to produce the full length spike protein in a in a in a specified uh um three-dimensional structure that is more amenable for for antigen presentation and antibody development and the way they conducted this trial uh they actually administered uh 30 micrograms of the of the vaccine which was the highest those tested in the in the earlier in the phase one and phase two study that we i think we have discussed before and and the way they stole it was two doses 21 days apart um and this is different from like the astra seneca for instance is 28 days apart the one that have been studied uh by the university of oxford and this uh analysis was uh showing the data of um healthy volunteers or volunteers 16 years of age of age and older although they had a small group of 12 to 15 they did not show those results at this point nor did they presented to the fda um and and they excluded patients with a history of immunosuppression either because of medication or or underlying condition and also um patients who had history of copying nitin although in reality they didn't uh exclude those who didn't know had covenanted so there were some patients who actually were vaccinated uh who had been exposed previously previously to copy by vaccine but it was a small minority and then the primary endpoint which is the most important where they confirm copy 19 cases and they they call confirm copy 19 cases patient who had at least one symptom and you know the classical symptoms of fever fatigue and osmia et cetera and they had to have also a pcr a positive pcr um and they actually uh started counting the cases for the primary and bone 10.7 days after the second dose that was the the moment when they said okay we're gonna really start the the the primary endpoint evaluation although they look at other other moments in the vaccination um times but it was actually for the primary important was seven days after the circles let me advance here and and one thing that i want i want just everybody to to be clear is how vaccine efficacy is calculated because you know maybe it may be intuitive but there's actually a formula for for vaccine efficacy and it's actually um a hundred times one minus the the irr and the irr is actually a ratio is the the the ratio of of patients who develop the disease among those vaccinated divided by those who who develop the disease in this case kobe 19 divided by those vaccinated by the placebo and if you use this example let's say that we have 10 000 patients and 10 develop the disease in the in the in the real vaccine in the active arm of the trial and a hundred of ten thousand develop the disease in the placebo that gives you a zero point one and then one minus point one it's it's point nine times a hundred is ninety percent so this will give you the the the so-called vaccine efficacy it's a very relatively simple formula i have seen it calculated with just by person vaccinated person but in this trial they actually use person a year so they have to calculate the follow-up and incorporate a time of follow-up of these patients in the in the formula and and they define it as um you know this formula where the irr is calculated to confirm cases of copy illness per 100 person years okay so how they did this trial had more than 40 000 participants and you can see the disposition of the patients 44 000 were screened they ended up randomizing and 43 eight um and and um some of them were assigned to the to the b uh to the to the bnt to the active vaccine um and and others to the placebo obviously this is a one to one randomization so it was equal uh probability of getting the placebo or the active um of the active vaccine and then at the end uh they ended up analyzing 1800 who who actually received the those one um i'm sorry eighteen thousand and eighteen thousand receive also the placebo and a similar number received the second dose uh of the vaccine and the placebo and you can see um very few patients if you if you take into consideration this huge trial of 18 000 only 48 and 95 discontinued after the trial after after those those two there was one patient died um unrelated death in the in this um in this arm against two and the placebo and obviously were things that you might expect if you enroll enough people that that some things might may happen to them uh during the follow-up um the distribution or the balance among the groups was was very similar because this was a randomized trial but some things to um to point out the uh white white race was actually the majority as you can see over 80 80 to 83 in each in each arm were white um very very small uh representation by other races only nine percent african-american ethnicity they had close to 30 percent latinos so so it was 27.9 and 28 in the in the bnt and placebo arms and that's that's important this is a different i think with moderna with some of the others that have higher uh higher representation by other by other races and ethnicity this was as you can see mostly mostly whites you can see the countries the age uh there was 42 percent of the of the patient were actually over 55 so that's important to have a good representation because this is this is the group more susceptible to the to the worst complication of kobe 19 and there were a significant proportion of these uh subjects um and this is probably the representation of the of the population in the u.s and in other countries 35 percent of the of the subjects were uh considered obese uh with a with a bmi over 30. and then let's let's we're going to see the safety and the efficacy the safety uh they actually collected data on the reactorgenicity which is basically and then they deal with with like an electronic with an app in which people after they got the vaccine they registered their symptoms and there were local reactions and systemic reaction and and and the authors of this paper actually divided the analysis uh between the groups and between the doses so it was um less than 55 over 55 and and and that's what we're going to see in the next few graphs so the first the first graph uh are the the younger groups 16 to 55 and you can see this is those one on top those two and these are local reactions so we're we're basically talking about redness swelling and pain and you can see really the the significant uh the only really significant uh event was was pain on the side of injection which was different from the placebo significantly different from the placebo so just to to have a sort of a ballpark idea around 80 percent uh of the subjects um developing in the injection site but but the great majority were either mild or moderate pain the red line are the the more severe pain so so that's something that we are going to expect in probably the the the biggest proportion of of of of participants or in this case of people who are vaccinated um if we see this is the same graph for but for for over 55 and the first uh detail that that that comes to mind is the fact that older folks have less reactorgenicity so you can see that here it's it's really averaging between the first and the second those around 66 and 70. so around 70 of the uh great older than 55 have had pain in the in the in the area of injection so those were the local the local uh reactions the systemic reactions are a little bit less frequent but nevertheless significant you can see the fever um and this is the age over 55 fever was 11 in this group fatigue headache more or less 20 25 but it was also present in the placebo and the placebo here was actually sailing it was not another vaccine so so you know it's reasonable to expect some degree of fatigue in in probably one third to half of the of the subject and you can see the the the second thing is that there is a difference between those one and those two in the systemic event so it's more much more frequent the the fatigue and the headache during the second dose than in the first dose but nevertheless nothing really really uh extraordinary here and you can see you know few patients have muscle pain diarrhea chills joint pain etc and this is greater than 55 and younger than than 55 you can see a very similar picture again those two is more more reactogenic than those one because probably the immune system already reacts more vigorously and you can see that some of the patients had um severe fatigue and some of the patients have severe headache um but usually the authors make the comment that the great majority of these symptoms go away after 24 maximum 48 hours so that's that's reassuring and then there were very few uh serious adverse event actually for uh and this you know taken into consideration the size of this trial for related serious subversiven um among the vaccine recipient and you can see that they're you know not really um anything anything to be concerned at this point shoulder injury related to the vaccine lymphadenopathy one patient had a ventricular arrhythmia and leg paresthesia we may have not may not nothing to do with the vaccine and and um and that there were two uh in the vaccine recipients one from atherosclerosis and another one cardiac arrest and remember we are enrolling in this patient subjects who are are older than than 55 and then really older groups so and they were also for that in the recipients also completely unrelated to the to the placebo obviously hemorrhagic stroke a myocardial infarction um but no no no none of the death were related to the vaccine or the placebo were just um you know random events that occurred to the to this large number of participants then the other the other data here is the efficacy and and they actually that the main endpoint that they look was a patient without any evidence of infection before those seven days of the second dose and the vaccine efficacy um it's 95 as you have heard in the in the in the press in the news if you look if you include those who who had kobe during the the in the in the time between the first and the second dose it didn't change significantly 94.6 um efficacy so so that's that's like the main main finding regarding uh efficacy um if we um analyze the efficacy by different groups you can see and in this column the vaccine efficacy it's really pretty uh similar across all um age groups 95 93.4 so very very very consistent among all of the groups the only common that i would make is because some of these groups have so few events the the ins the confidence intervals are really wide like in this case more than 75 there was only five cases in the in the placebo group so so as you might expect when you apply the calculation the confidence interval really are really wide i mean from -13 so non-protected to 100 protected uh in the case of the greater than 75 and the same thing happened because there were so few uh african-americans you can see yeah the efficacy was 100 but it was because there were zero and seven cases in the in the vaccine and placebo respectively so so you have to interpret that with caution but overall very consistent uh over 90 percent efficacy in in all groups studied even with underlying condition and then how soon the vaccine protects uh this is the curve of the events every square here it's a it's a kobe 19 event every circle is a it's a kobe 19 event uh in red the black vaccine group and glue the placebo and you can see that the curb tends to divert after more or less day 12 day 10 to day 12 and they make it bigger here so you can see that around day 12 you start seeing the benefit of the first dose um because the as as i mentioned this vaccine was applied um you know day 0 and day 21 so even even the first those seem to be to provide or confirm some protection and you can see how the curve divert to the point um of that and then the dark the dark marks are the severe disease and you can see there are more severe disease and the placebo only one here in the in the in the vaccine arm so so obviously this this vaccine protects against disease in general and also decreases the incidence of severe disease in those vaccinated so and this is this is probably the most important uh graph and so so for the discussion and this is my last my last slide essentially or before last um there are some unanswered questions i mean we know that the ficus is 90 95 but there's still questions about it does does this vaccine prevent transmission that wasn't really analyzed in this paper or in the report to the fda for that they need to look at asymptomatic infection and we don't know if it prevents asymptomatic infection they do comment in the paper that they they are going to have a serologic endpoint which is going to tell us if the vaccine worked against asymptomatic infection or not but we don't have that information obviously this this was the median follow-up of two months uh for severity and efficacy so we really don't know um you know how long the protection is going to last and and obviously despite being very large trial i mean if there is an event that is less than uh it's less frequent than point zero one percent it's probably not um this study was not detected or it was not i'm sorry designed to detect uh such an infrequent event so we have to wait when they vaccinate you know hundreds of thousands of people to actually see those very rare events events if there's going to be any uh and finally there are some subgroups which which were really not um reported there were 196 hiv hiv-positive patients in the study but they didn't report the immunogenicity in that group they excluded immunosuppressed they excluded pregnant and bacterium females although the the american society of obstetric and american college of society society of or college of uh obstetrics and gynecology actually um um said that that if if uh if a working person in a kobe war like a nurse that works in icu is pregnant and requires the vaccine that the vaccine can be given because they they think there's not um data that there's any any um ill effect with it but it obviously wasn't it wasn't stolen in this group and then again the less than 16 still need future uh or newer studies and then the other thing that has been speculated it's uh it because the graph separated at 12 days um could we use just one dose and vaccinate more people and that's something that this story was not designed because obviously at day 21 people got another dose so you don't know how long that that single dose protection really lasts so so it's it's impossible to tell but those are some of the questions that i that i have uh after reading the the the pfizer report for the to the fda and these and this paper and and just and and i have heard this quote several times but i just want to um remind this quote by whistling treasury which i think it's it's uh um it's uh important at this point where we are um and this this happened when when when the the the british got the first victory against germany in egypt um and he said now this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning so so that's what we are i think right now thank you i want to start stop sharing and and go to to carl and joanna thank you thank you dr sosa so much that was a fantastic review of the the pfizer uh vaccine really appreciate it um for everyone on the call right now please please continue to put in put your questions in the chat um so you don't forget them and so we have we can get to them as soon as our updates are over with we're gonna turn to uh dr leslie hayes our ambulatory specialist dr hayes and then we're going to proceed on to uh marla sivers has some updates from the department of health regarding vaccines hi so i'm actually not going to be um talking about studies this week i um got curious there are definitely things that i've learned from cobit that i think i will learn in the use in the future and i asked my covid group on facebook and the providers i work with what they have learned from kova that they will use in a post-covert world and um i got so many really fascinating responses i'm not going to get through all of this today i'm just going to go through um the first few slides especially because i want to hear what um marla has to say but i thought i'd just start and um one of my favorite comments was the experience of the pandemic reminds me of those blue kid pills the kids the dentists used to get kids to chew to show them all the places they missed with their toothbrush and covet has definitely shown us where the gaps were and i know that's a pink pill the blue ones looked really pretty awful and i decided i couldn't put that up so by far and away the three most popular responses that i got on what people thought that they would continue to do differently after the pandemic is over because of their experience with covid were telehealth masks and zoom and if anyone is not following andrew cotter and his dogs on twitter you definitely want to do it this is his zoom meeting with his dogs to discuss um the the business so today i'm just going to go over what people said they had learned about telehealth during the pandemic and so people said there were a lot of advantages for providers from telehealth telehealth has opened up a world of possibilities i can leave for a month continue to see patients not have to ask anyone to cover for me telehealth visits are especially helpful for our patients with transportation issues time management is so much easier if you can do telemedicine for things like medication checks and follow-up visits for a lot of issues and i think this is a really important one we have a mechanism in my department to switch your schedule to remote if you're sick but not that sick so then we don't infect each other working from home does not equal low productivity i think we've all been kind of shocked to find that we are actually as productive or more so when we work from home we can also do things like get the laundry done and sweep and mop the floors in between patients for people who have long commutes it definitely saves on commute commuting time someone posted that they live in a chicago suburb and they were saving an hour and a half every day saves on gas eating out and buying new outfits and very cost effective cherry on top is the kids are ill you don't have to get emergency child care and somebody who couldn't work from home commented that hopefully everyone else has learned that it's feasible to work from home so the traffic is better for the people who actually can't work from home and then some visits just are better over telehealth according um uh so newborn televisions um it's so much nicer to have people i'm getting an echo somewhere um it's so much nicer not to have to make people schlep a newborn baby out things like reflux dacross that cryostenosis constipation if the baby is cooing and term and looks well it's just as easy to see them over the phone laceration evaluation is another thing that people said works well over the phone and then definitely for i have found for patients with substance use disorder and mental health issues that they're often willing to tell me stuff over the phone that they're just too embarrassed to say in person and then um social anxiety severe depression generalized anxiety ptsd all of them can be much more open over the phone than they ever were in person um people mentioned for rare conditions if there's only you know one specialist who deals with your condition in denver sometimes it's really helpful to be able to get an expert opinion um over the telehealth and someone else mentioned they're in oncology and they're two hours from new york city or philadelphia and but a lot of the patients hate to leave home and they can actually get sub-specialty opinions uh without convincing the patients to travel and then advantages for patients it's a great time saver one physician mentioned that they didn't have to take time off or drive two hours round trip for a fall appointment they just closed their office door for 15 minutes and then they were back at work and then also for patients who have a baby and don't have child care it's been a real blessing for them sometimes they're distracted but someone calling and connecting with them is better than nothing somebody did mention one disadvantage and i've definitely had this where some patients are not making their appointments a priority you're calling them and they are shopping i had one patient who was driving and doing a video call i made him pull over um i've definitely had patients who were you know comparing the prices of uh various cuts of meat while i'm trying to talk to them um having people over they're not making their appointments a priority as much as they would if they came in then the other thing is payment um i think we've all realized we were providing just a huge amount of free medical care over the phone before now and that actually can be put into a telemedicine build um everybody's hoping insurance will really continue to cover and patients really appreciate it it makes follow-ups much easier especially for patients with transportation issues and also hopefully insurance companies will continue to allow us to build just for phone sessions we've gone mostly to phone in my organization because so few people have smart phones or video connections and much of northern new mexico just does not have the bandwidth to do zoom for patients with economic and other barriers there was a lot of disagreement among the comments about whether or not it was more beneficial or less i personally found it to be very beneficial one person her comment was telehealth for what she called sdoh social determinants of health patients is ensuring that they will continue to do worse i'm not totally sure that's true but definitely there are patients who it's made worse um somebody said the majority of their patients just don't have the technology to do telehealth and they have ended up in the er more than usual out of medication and doing worse than before and technology is a barrier but transportation is also a barrier so it's hard to say which is harder for people and somebody commented that it seemed worse for the rural and elderly patients but better for the more urban disadvantaged patients who have a decent video signal somebody else said that their english as a second language patients um just were not able to do the telephone visits and they've been transferring into this clinic who would see them in person and somebody else commented that televisions are a great way to reach many of the underserved and marginalized patients and the home bell and elderly are happy to have the telephone visits and they have been following up more and then somebody else said they'd had the opposite experience from patients who were struggling with telehealth and instead they'd done several research qi projects and they found that the number one barrier for their patients was transportation so the expansion of telehealth had really let them reach patients who otherwise had had very inconsistent care and now and i've certainly had this happen as well that patients who really need an in-office visit for a pelvic exam or something else like that just want to do all of it over the phone it's like no i really can't do this visit over the phone and um somebody else commented that they're less privileged patients had a hard time getting the office for appointments whether they were working or they had to go pick up their child so they were much better able to follow up with video visits and i think yeah so and i'll go on to the next section next week thank you dr hayes um fantastic um and it'd be curious to see what other people um are doing in terms of their uh televisions and uh zoom visits as well well that was a nice break from turning now to marla sivers to talk about vaccines again um marla are you there i'm here great um what can you tell us in terms of you know vaccine distribution in new mexico and um uh any any gaps that dr sosa did not provide what would you be able to share with us and we also had some questions in the chat that i can either go over after or you can certainly maybe get to right now sure i wanted to share some updates from some phone calls that i attended over the weekend with cdc and members from the fda and asip advisory committees where they discussed some of the recommendations that they have now posted on the cdc and fda website so just sort of to share an update from those calls and share what's happening in new mexico so as you all know the fdi fda immunization advisory committee met on december 10th and recommended that the fda grant emergency use authorization for the pfizer vaccine in person 16 years of age and older and the fda issued that emergency youth authorization on friday evening and shipments of the vaccine began over the weekend some vaccine has already arrived in new mexico today and some healthcare workers in one of our hub hospitals will start receiving their vaccine this afternoon so we are expecting additional shipments of that initial 17 500 pfizer doses to arrive to continue to arrive today but also to arrive tomorrow and wednesday and vaccine distribution will begin immediately hhs will be rolling out additional supplies of vaccine as they become available and part of how states will get their allocation is based on not only their population but their demonstrated ability to mobilize the vaccine and get it administered so all vaccines that are administered are reported through our statewide immunization monitoring program through the impsis nmcis and that gets reported daily to hhs and so as we are able to demonstrate our ability to get the vaccine distributed and show that it's not sitting in a refrigerator or a freezer somewhere we can expect that we'll continue to receive additional distributions week by week so the pfizer uh vaccine is two doses administered 21 days apart um there was some discussion um over the weekend you know what would happen if a person was not able to get their second dose on the 21st day um and there was some discussion about sort of a three-day window on either side of that um to get your second dose um it looks like what's on the cdc website is you know up to three days before day 21 and if you go past day 21 then getting your second dose as soon as possible um after day 21. so the vaccine is shipped in multi-dose vials that are not diluted and frozen as you all know and the vaccine has to be thought at room temperature um for at least 30 minutes so brought up to room temperature diluted and then administered once the vaccine's been diluted and reconstituted it's only good for six hours and after six hours any remaining vaccine must be discarded so there's an fda fact sheet that's up on the fda webpage this morning that walks through all of the dosage handling and administration instructions just a warning it's quite long it's 29 pages but it is available on the fda website today the pfizer vaccine should not be administered to individuals with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine and the discussion this weekend the two adverse reactions in the uk are still being investigated but the current thinking is that these two healthcare providers who had severe allergic reactions were reacting to one of the lipid nano particles in the vaccine um so that's the current thinking and the full dosing and contraindications for people who have previous known allergies as in the package insert they did recommend that people who had had serious reactions to other vaccines or injectables sort of proceed with caution basically you know have a risk assessment discussion with your health care provider make sure that the vaccine would be administered in a setting where a severe allergic reaction could be appropriately managed and that that person should be observed for 30 minutes following their vaccination so those people can still be vaccinated but it's a you know discuss and proceed with caution make sure you're getting the vaccine in the appropriate setting um the most common side effects is dr said we're really injection site pain and redness chills fatigue muscle aches joint pain typically these reactions developed within one to three days following the vaccination and similarly resolved with within one to three days so fairly mild reactions um let's see there's really no data currently on the safety and efficacy of using the vaccine and pregnant and lactating persons however the american college of obstetrics and gynecology did come out with a statement saying if you're a person who would normally be prioritized for vaccine because of your work or your exposures and you happen to be pregnant you should discuss with your provider but that they would recommend proceeding with vaccine unless there was another reason not to like one of these you know severe allergic reactions the vaccine should not be co-administered with other vaccines so you can't get your flu vaccine and your covet vaccine at the same time they recommend that you wait at least 14 days before or after before administering any other vaccines people who were previously infected with covet 19 can be vaccinated as long as they're outside their infectious periods so if they've met the criteria for recovery and they're no longer in their infectious period they can receive the vaccine however there was some discussion that people may want to sort of de-prioritize in that first 90 days following their infection they will have some natural immunity and while vaccine supplies are very limited those people may choose to sort of de-prioritize themselves during that 90 days post-infection people who have received who had coveted and received a monoclonal antibody treatment the current recommendation uh discussed over the weekend was that those people should wait 90 days before receiving the vaccine so those are people who've received treatment with monoclonal antibodies um there were some questions about how getting the vaccine might affect future covid tests so there's no reason to think that getting a copic vaccine would affect your test result from a pcr or an antigen test um there are some igg and igms that look for that spike protein and so those current serology tests would not be able to determine between uh you know vaccine response or a response from covet infection so how that will impact you know ongoing serial prevalence studies is sort of unknown at this point so i think more information to come about that people who get their first dose with the spicer vaccine should also get their second dose with the same vaccine product there's currently no evidence about mixing vaccine products when people get vaccinated they'll get a card which gives information about the type of the vaccine they received the date they received it when their second dose is due and also importantly a link to a phone app called v-safe that will be used to conduct um active uh post-vaccine monitoring so people who enroll in be safe will get a text message every day for the first five days um inquiring about any vaccine reactions and linking people to resources if they report vaccine reactions and then after the initial five days they'll get a weekly message for the next five weeks they'll also get a reminder by text when it's almost time for them to get their second dose and then there's some ongoing monitoring at 3 6 and 12 months post vaccination through this v-safe phone app there's a copa19 vaccination tool kit which has been posted to cdc um and on december 17th so thursday this week the fda advisory committee will be meeting again to discuss emergency use authorization recommendations for the moderna vaccine and so if the panel recommends an emergency use authorization i suspect that fda will move quickly on that like they did with the pfizer vaccine if the moderna vaccine is approved we're expecting about 40 000 doses to come to new mexico um in that following a couple of weeks many of those are going to be distributed through a federal pharmacy partnership program with cvs and walgreens which will target long-term care residents and staff and i'll in the chat i'm going to put a email address that clinicians can use to reach out to the vaccine program if they have questions about when their you know clinic or healthcare setting may be prioritized for vaccine and how to get connected with those resources so i'll put that in the chat so people have it thank you marla that was an amazing update and we are so appreciative uh for your time and all the meetings there was so much more so i tried to give like a really quick kind of the top questions that uh came up and um even though dr sosa reminded us this is not the end i have to tell you i feel almost giddy with excitement that this is finally happening yeah well if you're if you're giddy i'm gonna i'm gonna really get giddy then i'm gonna follow your lead if you're giddy that's good news marla um i'm gonna turn it over to carla who's uh who has lots of questions um i know there's most of the questions are vaccine related and since we have you uh we'd like to you know be able to ask you and nestor lots of vaccine related questions today so carla thank you thank you joanna um you amazingly you answered a lot of them violet in your in your discussion but there is a and i'm not sure if you talked about this specifically but fred fox was asking where in new mexico is the pfizer vaccine being distributed so that initial allotment from pfizer it's a very small number of doses 17 500 doses and it's being primarily distributed to our partner hub hospitals so these are the hub hospitals that have been working you know since the beginning of the pandemic as part of our triage and transfer team um you know they're the primary sort of health systems located in each of their health regions throughout the state and so they will be receiving sort of those first doses to vaccinate their priority health care staff such as nurses who work you know in the icu uh critical care providers respiratory therapists intensivists each hospital has kind of created their priority list there's obviously not a vaccine to be enough vaccine available initially to be able to vaccinate everyone on that list um so hospitals will have sort of their own pri prioritization protocol and as we get more vaccine you know those will start to become open pods rather than closed pods and i know many hospitals are planning on working with partner institutions first responders ems and others in that priority group in their region to help distribute vaccine to those folks as well thank you marla and there's another question about the navajo nation was that is that allotment include the navajo nation or did i think they got separate vaccine is what i read they got a separate vaccine allotment and also uh federal facilities like the va and ihs are getting a separate allotment as well okay perfect thank you and there's a question about bell's palsy is i don't know nestor if you want to comment on this was there um bell's palsy scene related to the vaccine yeah there was a not on the pfizer vaccine but i saw the report for the astra seneca vaccine there were three cases of facial paralysis on each arm actually three in the placebo and three cases in the in the treatment arm so so and you know the if you have 40 000 patients you may see some facial paralysis the the incidence is around 20 to 30 cases for 100 000 people so if you have 40 people and you follow them long enough some of them will develop facial paralysis and and it could be unrelated to the vaccine but but yeah there were three cases in the vaccine in the astrazeneca stories uh but there was also three cases in the in the placebo i don't remember if there were any in the physics i don't think there was any in the pfizer because i i look at the data and i didn't see facial paralysis but i may be wrong but i remember clearly but it's it's something that is expected with this huge number of people who are enrolled thank you very much um there's a question from may goldenberg about is vaccine contraindicated for those on tnf blockers or other immunosuppressive medications i don't know marla or either if either of you know that uh currently no um the only contraindication that fda is currently um stating is people who've had a known allergic reaction to a vaccine com to a vaccine component that's part of the pfizer vaccine so that may change um as we learn more over the next few weeks but currently it's not a contraindication they do however say you know there's not enough information to know um about the efficacy of the vaccine in that group and what their immune response will be right thank you and another question about dial should dialysis patients be prioritized or do you know where they are in the prioritization scheme i think people with uh significant underlying conditions are in phase 1b so still in that first tier after we sort of get through um the healthcare worker priority thank you jeff miller do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question i'm not sure if you feel like it was answered or can you go ahead and unmute yourself okay sure oh i can you hear me [Music] oh sorry i was asking for jeffrey miller to unmute himself i apologize no problem can you hear me yeah so uh my question is uh with the fate when you're talking about getting to patients there are different priorities of patients how is the system going to determine when someone can go get their shot so for example would doctors have to write an order that hey my patient has this pre-existing condition or how are we how is that going to be figured out so i think some of that is still being figured out um however you know once we get into um a period where we're sort of past the phase you know one a group moving into the phase one b group if we have more vaccine available from moderna that doesn't require the ultracold storage you know then i think the plan for the vaccine program is to engage their vaccine partners people who are already doing vaccines you know in clinics throughout the community who are enrolled with the new mexico vaccine program to start to actually have those clinicians be able to place orders for the vaccine and vaccinate in their clinic that's a little further down the line you know not until after the first of the year until we have more supply i think will those um you know that roll out get firmed up a little bit more so i don't have a great answer to that question except that you know that's sort of in the planning phase as we uh move to the period of time where we have more vaccine available thank you marla there's been a couple of questions i know you said that you were going to put um some information into the chat but about how physicians in the community who are not connected to these hub hospitals how they are going to access vaccine for their patients yeah and that's you know again going to be a distribution through the vaccine program i put the email address in the chat so people can email the vaccine program to inquire you know specifically about when their clinic would be able to order okay thank you very much um joanna back over to you thanks carla um and thanks nestor and and marla as well um there's a question from daniel smith daniel do you want to unmute and ask your question uh sure hi uh this is dan smith uh here i'm a director of pharmacy at the new mexico behavior at health institute and um uh i'm just getting lots of questions from people worried about egg allergies and we know lots of vaccines sometimes are derived from porsche elements or bovine elements and my read is that that doesn't seem to be an issue with the at least the pfizer vaccine i think modern as well and just looking for some confirmation of that point and then i think daniel you also asked about um is history of guillain-barre a contraindication thanks daniel thank you nestor or marla do you want to take that one yeah i just say what i know about the manufacturer this vaccine because it's not derived from a virus it's actually a synthetic product of mrna and then lipid um components which which accompanied the mrna there's no um link which either egg or or any other animal product that we know of it and that's what there's no advice on allergy to eggs or or any animal product because it's completely synthetic it's done essentially in the lab uh and not derived from from like cell cultures in in embryonated eggs or something like that that we used to do with with the influenza vaccine uh thank you nestor um and i think we talked about uh melvina mccabe asked about the distribution to ihs hospitals and i think marley you said that that was a a separate distribution line as as was the the va hospital um i think as well as the pueblos as well too marla ihs will have their own um allocation so not all uh tribal entities you know are part of ihs so the ones that aren't will coordinate with department of health but ihs facilities will get their own allotment great um i'm wondering if uh laura perrajone if you might want to unmute and ask your question about those people experiencing homelessness oh hi thank you joanna that's so nice of you to allow me to ask my question yeah so um i have a question about seven day quarantine i know that the you know that new mexico doesn't have the seven day quarantine but we do have a lot of people experiencing homelessness at the largest shelter here it's about 300 people a night there and many of them don't you know it's difficult for them to stay the 14-day quarantine and so we were wondering dr sosa if you have any thoughts about that for certain types of populations like people experiencing homelessness would you consider a seven day knowing that they perhaps might stay seven days so you could assure at least seven days of quarantine and then would you consider then doing like um we have an id now um abbott id binax testing unit there and i was wondering what your thoughts were on that it's still a pcr i know and i've heard it's not as accurate but would that be a reasonable thing um to do um yeah i know it's kind of like off label right now but what are your thoughts on that yeah no that's a great question i really have uh i haven't really thought much of of of of that and and the logistics of vaccinating homeless persons and um you know the use of of the uh um binax uh id now so i i don't really have i don't know if marla or some of the other uh in the in the in the group can can answer but i really haven't really thought of that to be honest laura marla any thoughts about the seven a seven day quarantine yeah hi dr paran um i i've seen your written proposal about this um and i think yeah yeah david shared it with me and um you know i think that for your setting and the resources that you have available including the binax testing you know i think your your reasoning and your plan is sound and makes a lot of sense um and i know you're sort of waiting for some more official feedback from department of health about that but um i did see your proposal and you know i think you're kind of utilizing all of your resources and making the best of a really difficult situation to try to make sure people is or you know are as protected as possible yeah and i guess my question was also around like using like because we have both the binax now the little you know the one that looks like the pregnancy test but we also have the id now little machine that apparently is pcr and more accurate like if if that was a situation where you would say let's end the quarantine at seven days you know would it be would it be better preferable i mean obviously it's kind of difficult sometimes because we have a huge number of people in there but like would it be would it be okay to say if you're trying to compare the id now test machine you know the machine versus the binax cards do you guys have a preference around that i guess that's kind of another question i have like yeah in general i can tell you it's we don't have carrissa here to help us but in general the the obviously the rapid test the lateral flow test have a slightly lower sensitivity than the than the more formal you know machine base electronic reader pcr so so if if i i guess if if you're planning to shorten the quarantine you like a sensitive test you don't want people with infection be released from quarantine but it's it's a cost uh effectivity analysis and it depends on you know the resources but obviously if i have a choice and and and cost is not an issue i will select the most sensitive test uh in order to to prevent people from from escaping detection uh because in fact yeah id now and some of the antigen tests require a higher viral load they're a good indication of of transmissibility where their sensitivity is slightly lower than than the than the standard pcrs or the more sophisticated pcr determination correct okay thank you so much this is super helpful so so you would say just overall um i mean obviously i'm waiting for the doh i just wanted like it was that asked dr sosa days like yay um to just ask for like the scientific back background piece of it um okay so so yeah so um so uh marla i will just await whatever you guys decide and then i just wanted to know like scientifically was it okay thanks laura thank you thank you great appreciate it um i just wanted to turn to uh dr fred fox would you like to unmute and ask your question you have got a great question or maybe i will just an interest of time be able to read it whatever um would you like to ask it or you're you're muted sure my question had to do about the availability of the vaccine to rural and small town healthcare providers since the pfizer's going to the big places and the first modernist going to cvs for long-term care facilities that leaves small town and rural healthcare workers out in the cold initially for phase 1a are they looking at that for any other way to get vaccine to those groups of healthcare work so is spicer going to also be distributing to to the smaller hospitals in other words yeah so the hub hospitals will be doing uh some redistribution to their spoke hospitals um so you know if you look at your designated hub hub hospital um you know in your area so you know like for roswell um eastern new mexico medical center is the is the hub hospital but they're working with their spoke hospitals so those smaller community hospitals around them to help identify those people in phase 1a and distribute vaccine through that hub and spoke model that has existed as i said kind of from the beginning of the pandemic to help make sure we're allocating you know hospital beds and other hospital resources effectively thank you marla i just wanted to point everybody to the um at 12 45 the cme link went into the chat and even if you don't need it you can certainly fill it out and always give us pointers in in terms of how we can do better um just in the interest of time i'd like to invite dr laura tomadi she's one of our project echo senior research scientists to come on and just tell you a little bit about a project that um that she's doing um in terms of looking in terms of improving uh the quality of this office hours infectious disease echo dr tomati hi thank you all so i know that we're um almost that time but i wanted to thank you all so much for participating in this echo and hopefully it's been helpful to you um we especially as the landscape of covet is about to change pretty drastically we'd really like to hear from you on how we can improve this echo what has worked for you um so we're going to be conducting just a a small focus group sometime between the 18th and the 22nd um right after the session today you will receive an email from that new mexico govind19 email address that you get the you get the registration info for this session you'll be getting an email from the email address that will invite you to um participate in a focus group where you would give us feedback so that we can make this the best possible echo for everybody involved um please please share your feedback we would really appreciate it um just so you know that email will go out to folks who have attended three or excuse me four or more times so if you've only if you're new to the echo you've only attended maybe once or twice uh you are super welcome we hope that you will definitely continue to join us however we're hoping this time to just do the focus groups among the folks who have attended for more time so please email us um at that email and let us know if you are willing to um you know give us your feedback we would love it and we'd really appreciate it would uh hopefully just take a little bit of your time um so thank you i hope you all have a good day thank you so much laura we really appreciate it and we we certainly appreciate everybody on on the line right now and every week um with that i just wanted to let everybody know that we have many weekly uh echoes at two o'clock today we have a first responder resiliency echo that is talking about coping with grief um we have an uh dr michelle harkins has a critical care echo this thursday and i'm just uh it slipped my mind the topic but i think elena martinez might be able to post it in the chat um and then um i believe um over the course of the next couple of weeks dr aurora is is having echo covered 19 um conversations kind of global conversations about a covid19 that you might be getting emails about as well so really wanted to thank dr hayes dr sosa and thank marla for coming on today and give a special update on vaccines and um hope we all we will see you all next week and i really hope you might be able to participate in the focus group sessions we'll learn an awful lot thank you everybody thank you carla you\"\n",

      "Text: \"group c and d uh the ones that had the adjuvant the 50 micrograms of the agilent which is a plant-based adjuvant and and received two doses were the two most uh immunogenic vaccines and we can see here we have the placebo a b and you can see the five microgram and the 25 micrograms a double dose those one and two using the matrix which is the matrix mi is the adjuvant they have the higher and this is the the anti-spike igg the highest level of antibody and they actually use uh convalescent uh plasma levels to compare these are patients who actually recover from kobe uh some have asymptomatic disease some were hospitalized like the one in in purple and other had like just outpatient kobe and you can see that the the level of antibodies with the vaccines which are actually comparable or maybe slightly higher but definitely similar to convalescent plasma on those five micrograms and and 25 microgram double dose of the vaccine so probably they're gonna move forward with the five microgram because as you can see produce the same immunological response these are the the neutralizing antibodies which is the other measure that we have shown in previous studies again uh decent levels neutralizing antibodies comparable to the convalescent plasma in the double dose adjuvant vaccine so so good results from the humeral immunity and there was a correlation between the antique spike because this is basically a spike protein injected um between the anti-spikes igg and the neutralizing antibodies are linear correlation very clear um on the on the generation of neutralizing antibodies associated with antibodies to this by protein looking at the at the t cell response um from the from the best two candidates the five microgram and 25 both generated th1 type of of cytokines and and cellular response and almost none uh th2 which is which is considered not not appropriate uh you you when you use this type of vaccine for respiratory viruses you prefer th1 because th2 have been associated with some uh evidence of of long inflammation especially with the rsv vaccine so so so this protein with adjuvant uh produce good humeral response and good cellular response and that was basically the conclusion of these uh small story phase one two and they're obviously going to move forward with this protein vaccine to the phase three studies the other the other uh clinical trial that was published was the the the gamalia institute vaccine or the russian vaccine as a as it is known on the on the media this is actually an adenovirus human adenovirus recombinant adenovirus vaccine and uses two different adenovirus adenovirus 26 and adenovirus 5 and within that adenovirus which is which is actually a virus that can cause you know a reaction in the body but it's not replicative the inside of these these virus they put a small piece of uh genetic material that actually uh produces the the spike protein so the idea is to use this as a a vector to get into the cells and then to produce the protein and then the immune system will recognize the spike protein from from from the from the coronavirus and and thus give give you protection they actually i'll show you the design of the story they actually did two studies one with the frozen vaccine they call it a gamma layer copied back which is basically frozen and another one leo files preparation 38 volunteers in each arm so a relatively small phase one slash two study and they they uh actually administer different preparation there's no placebo here to one group of nine subjects they gave just the adenovirus 26 um another group just got the adenovirus 5 and then 20 received uh sort of a sequential the adenovirus 26 on day 0 and then adenovirus 5 on day 21 so it was sort of a prime booster with two different adenovirus and the idea is that in case the subject has immunity to adenovirus 26 natural immunity from previous infection um you're giving a different you're given the the protein the s-protein with a different adenovirus a second time around with with the hope of producing a better response and very similar uh for the la the lyophilized vaccine 26 5 by itself or the combination which is what they actually plan to do on the large um and then they follow this patient and evaluate the immune response safety and and immunogenicity and by the way i didn't mention the safety of the nova x vaccine but they they obviously did not um detected any serious adverse event in those small small studies just local and and systemic reaction but were not really uh considered uh serious and this is the results of the of the russian story regarding antibodies against the spike protein or the rbd which is the receptor binding domain the the specific part of the spike protein that is presumed to be associated with neutralizing antibodies and you can see that for the combination on day 28 and 42 there were significantly high levels of antibodies both in the frozen and the leo lyo formulation and again they should they use also a very similar uh idea they compare with convalescent plasma from russian patients that have recovered from kobe 19. so these are the levels of antibodies which you can see that are similar to the levels achieved in day 28 and 42 with his vaccine so apparently apparently good immune response the same with neutralizing antibodies you can see the levels at day 42 uh pretty decent levels very similar to what you get with the natural infection according to these uh russian scientists and when you look at t-cell t-cell immunity they actually measure the proportion of cd4 and cda cells that were stimulated or or growth and they and they found basically also a good cellular immune response with these adenovirus recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine um and and and also interferon gamma release also which is a sign of th1 again with the with the the two formulations of vaccine they didn't find any any significant difference between the two preparation the frozen and the and the other the the the lyophilia feliz um vaccine so their conclusion was that these heterologous adenovirus vaccine with 26 and 5 induce had a good safety profile and induce strong humeral and cellular immune responses after the the study was published i saw in the social media some criticism to some of the graphs and values they said that some of the values were repetitive so they're questioning their result but obviously we have to wait for the for the authors to to respond to those criticism in the in the journal but at least um they publish the phase one two study another another uh another uh different issue is the the use of of corticosteroids you remember we we actually talked about this with the recovery trial the recovery trial was the uk large trial that demonstrated that steroids especially in patients requiring oxygen or in mechanical ventilation had a mortality benefit or decreasing the mortality from using dexamethasone so the the investigator from the w a show uh group called the whole rapid evidence appraisal for copy therapy actually did a meta-analysis of of the seven randomized clinical trials that have been published using steroids they actually put together all that all those seven trials a total of um 1700 approximately 1700 critically ill patients with choline 19 and and their their conclusion was that they actually found uh in this meta-analysis was that in those in those 1700 patients there was an odds ratio of 0.66 of mortality so a 33 percent less mortality when they were treated with corticosteroids and in this case they use not only dexamethasone but they included they included uh materials alone um and hydrocortisone in there in their uh in their different trials so so it's sort of a um another piece of evidence that that actually is it's uh it's um additional to the recovery trial that was published before giving um usefulness for for steroids to decrease mortality per body in especially in patients with severe coping or advanced scoby not at the beginning of the disease that's important to to clarify and then we move just to finish a couple of interesting transmission papers or papers on transmission both from china and the first one it's an outbreak it's really really uh interesting this is an outbreak that occur uh in china during the lockdown uh and it occurred in a 30-story floor residential building in one sioux city uh in that building there were 202 residents 57 families some of the flats or or apartments were unoccupied in that relatively large building and actually they documented three families in that building affected the index family or the the first one has traveled to wuhan and then they found uh cases on the 25th and 27th floor and the interesting thing is that all the this is the the sort of the blueprint of the building and there were like three areas the area zero one zero three and zero four and all of the cases in the 15th 25th and 27th floor occur on these on this area so the authors actually postulated that that those infected in in the 15th floor somehow transmitted the disease through the through the through the pipes to actually to the black water pipes in the building and they actually have a drawing in the and their hypothesis and and you know it's it's sort of um exploratory hypothesis that that because the virus is just creating in fecal matter uh probably when the the families living on the 15th floor that were infected actually uh send the virus into the into the pipes essentially and then fecal aerosols probably travel up the black water pipe and got into the bathtub or floor drain in those uh bathroom in the 25th and 27th floor because there was no other epidemiological exposure for these families except for being in their house during the the the pandemic and no no contact with the with the with the family on 1502 so that's and they did also they they actually tested also a gas they put like a like a marker gas into the into the system and they were able to document the presence of the gas in other floors uh especially if the if the the new trap that it was dry there was no water here you can get the the vapor of the gas to come out out of the drain so interesting and these have been seen before with the sars kobe one some some of you may remember the outbreak in the amoy gardens building in i think in hong kong with the sars kobe one there were several people in that building affected with such kobe one so that was i thought it was interesting the other uh outbreak it's a demonstration of another outbreak in a closed environment this this was an activity um that also happened in china in which there were a group of of of uh lay buddhist buddhists who were going to a religious event one a group winning a boss 60 and another one 68 another boss and there was one person infected in boss number two and actually 24 out of the 68 turned out to be positive later on so that it was a 35.3 attack rate just by sharing the bus for a hundred minutes uh it was an air-conditioning boss so it had a close ventilation system and this is the sort of the the the pink and yellow are people who became infected white are those who did not become infected this is actually the the drawing of the boss and you can see that all over the bus there were positive positive uh persons with with uh with kobe then the index patient was the one in red here identified by ip uh this this group also shares some time in the in the uh actually temple that they visited but the attack rate in the temple was much less it was only 4.1 percent of the 172 people who attended that religious activity only seven that were not in the boss got infected as opposed to 24 out of 68 illustrating the you know the potential for for transmission in a in a close environment like this with with air condition for 100 minutes um so that was basically the conclusion all right thank you i want to start sharing and we'll go through the questions thank you so much nestor um marla seaver's some has has a brief update and then leslie sieber leslie hayes has a brief update and then we'll go through the questions of okay nestor marla thanks joanna i just had a brief announcement um department of health is engaged across many divisions in planning for a sars kobe vaccine rollout which we are told may be expected as soon as sometime in early november and so all state health departments are currently engaged in planning for receipt of this vaccine and rollout cdc has set some priority groups for vaccine one being frontline healthcare workers and the other being residents and employees in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities and as part of our vaccine planning we will be sending out a survey through the statewide immunization registry at the end of this week asking all health care providers primarily acute care hospitals community health centers fqhcs to respond and provide us some information about front-line healthcare workers in your facility particularly those that are engaged in high risk activities like icu care or respiratory therapy and also some questions about your ability to store vaccine and how many vaccine providers you might have at your location so what we're currently planning for is a roll out to priority populations as early as late fall and through the winter and then uh scaled up roll out which may reach population levels as early as this spring and so we're trying to plan for um how vaccine will be deployed around the state using partners like pharmacies hospitals and fqhcs to help us do that so if you receive that survey please respond we're using it for our planning for vaccine rollout and once that goes out i'll bring the link to this meeting next week in case you're unsure if your facility has received that and i'll bring it so that you all can follow up if you'd like for your facility to make sure that someone received that survey and responded thank you thank you thank you marla which vet do you know which vaccine is being entertained for the state all we've been told now is that you know among the six sort of primary vaccine candidates you know there's three that we hear a lot about and um they are anticipating that at least one we've not been told which one yet um available for early distribution sometime in november and like i said cdc is going to set some priorities with hhs about who that vaccine will be available to first and then the anticipation is that they that will continue to scale up um through the winter and that by spring 2021 we may have enough vaccine available to make it um you know widely distributed through the population so more to come there's a lot of we we have more um unanswered questions than answered at this point um but logistically um we're starting to get ready for that rollout thank you marla and please uh chat in your questions um i want to turn it over to leslie hayes who has a brief update as well i was mostly going to focus on mental health and covid today um first is just depression and they had a telephone survey of 1441 adults that they compared with nhanes data from prior to covered 19 and not surprising they found that depression was much much higher it's about three times higher um it's especially high if you have lower income less than five thousand dollars in savings and um quite high if you had exposure to more stressors um they also found that people who were married um have less risk of depression than people who are divorced or separated or people who have never been married so i think it's really important we'd be screening patients for this and offering referral to treatment and i think it's also in my experience been helpful just to kind of normalize that i have patients calling in and saying i just i don't know why i'm not coping and talking to them about the fact that this is actually very very common and multiple people are suffering from depression at this point i find has been reassuring to them um there was also a new york times article about this where they were talking about the long haulards actually anxiety and depression has been a very common symptom for them anxiety was actually the eighth most common symptom they listed and then difficulty concentrating and depression were also common and part of the reason they gave was that people didn't take them seriously thought they were just kind of milking it or you know didn't really have this or being unreasonable about it and so normalizing it and saying yes that this can happen afterwards um really um seemed to help and then some people actually stated that participation in online support groups improved their mental health symptoms and then um we've mentioned this before wall street journal had a pretty good article on this last week about the opioid crisis and just rising drug fatalities across the country they surveyed u.s adults in june and 13 they had either started or increased their substance use to deal with stress or emotions related to covid19 um social distancing is making it a lot harder for people to access meetings and counseling and then the pandemic also interrupted the supply chain so as a result people often needed to go to new dealers and potential for more potent drugs or potential to be contaminated with fentanyl any number of issues and then people are still this is still an issue of people delaying or avoiding medical care in june there was an estimate that 41 percent of you adult us adults had either delayed or avoided medical care including emergency or urgent care and routine care as well and i think it's really important we do let people know it is safe to come into our clinics the studies have really shown that people are not getting cobit from health care settings at this point i think the medical system despite not getting great support on ppe i think we've done a wonderful job of doing everything we can to make sure it's safe in our facilities and i think it's important to let people know that and especially if you look the people who are not getting urgent or emergency care was really prevalent among people who are also at high risk for covid so unpaid caregivers for adults persons with underlying medical conditions black adults hispanic adults young adults are the only group not at high risk but persons with disabilities and then this last one i thought was cool so um when i was eight i actually read an article about how they developed the smallpox vaccine and i thought that was so cool that i decided i wanted to be a doctor and um almost 50 years later here i am and so um so this was a an editorial in the new england journal and it was about um variolation so the difference between variolation and vaccination is that variolation actually uses the actual virus and it induces a mild infection and you get immunity from this and there was a really wonderful book a few years ago called the speckled monster that talked a lot about um a noble lady in england and a doctor in colonial america who introduced variolation into their communities and variola is the scientific name for the smallpox virus and so you're using just a small amount of smallpox virus they would inject just a small amount and induce immunity that way um so that people didn't get bad infection vaccination is where you're using something that's not actual virus to induce immunity and that's the original vaccine was vaccinia or cow pox so and what they found was universal masking seems to reduce the rate of new infections and possibly increases the proportion of infections that are symptomatic and they think it's due to the variolation that when you get exposed to it you get exposed to a much smaller amount because the masks are filtering it out so and they had a few um examples of this there was an outbreak on a closed argentinian cruise ship where the passengers were provided with surgical masks and the staff had an n95 rate of asymmetric infection on that ship was 81 and there was an earlier cruise ship where they did not have masking and that was only 20 percent there were also two recent outbreaks in u.s food processing plants and all the workers were issued masks and there were asymptomatic infections um uh among the 95 percent of the infections were asymptomatic among more than 500 people and only 5 actually had symptoms and then in countries that had mandatory enforced population wide masking the case fatality rates are lower even when you have resurgence of cases so i just thought that was kind of a cool thing and a good reason to wear masks so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie thanks for all the great updates i'm going to turn it over to carla who's going to start without all the great questions yeah thank you joanna um yeah there's a lot of questions so we're going to go we're gonna try to combine some of them i think um so nestor just the two the two studies that you presented at the at the end the one about particularly about the apartment building there are a couple of questions like i'm gonna just gonna go over a few of them and you can you can talk about that um they were asking about how did how did they know basically that it wasn't in the air and then transmitted through the air and also one of the questions was didn't people use the same elevators like how did they how did they decide that that was the way that that was transmitted yeah well first first of all there were no other cases in any other areas of the of the building so that was one it was only on that tower on that part of the tower second they didn't i mean they interview uh all of the affected families and you know according to what they reported they didn't coincide in any social areas or elevators as far as they could remember so so um so they they basically did it because they rule out other ways of contact and as i said um there were no other infections in any other areas and on the same floor or people who actually share the elevators more so that's why how they concluded obviously this is a working hypothesis but they concluded that the most likely source was these uh what they call the the the fecal bio aerosols through the through the pipes and as i said in the in the presentation they actually tested the hypothesis by putting uh gas in the in the in the system and they actually detected gas that special detectable gas in other floors above when they when they put it on the on the pipes and they also culture some of the apartments that were empty and they found virus in the apartments that were empty so that was another piece of evidence that not only they showed that the you know the testing gas could move up but also they didn't demonstrate the presence of virus in one of the floors above the 15th floor uh there was an apartment that there had not been no humans there uh because of the it was empty so so that was another piece of evidence that probably it actually traveled somehow and and what they said is that these families the difference between this family and other families is that they didn't use the bathtub so the hypothesis was that the manhole the thing that is like a u was was not with the water seal it was actually dry so the so the gas or the the bio aerosols can actually travel backward and go through the through the to the drain as opposed to people who are using their their their showers or their their bathtubs and they were filled with water in the in the u part so all of those were like sort of circumstantial evidence but the conclusion was the most likely was through these this type of of of of uh you know of pipes in the building as opposed to some other some other way great thank you fascinating um the other about the in in terms of the bus outbreak a couple of questions asked about masks were people wearing masks no they were not they were not they were not wearing masks it was really early in the in the epidemic and and what the author says that in that city there hasn't been any any cases of kobe 19 at that moment so people were not really wearing masks and as i said they they shared the boss and they also were together in the in the in the temple and they had i think either lunch or dinner during the activity but the interesting thing is was the the really the contagion occur mainly in the bus there were a few cases among uh other participants that didn't share the boss but it was definitely the bus the the area where most of the most of the positive and and the the other interesting thing is that those who were in the bus did not sit together to have lunch they actually were mixed with other groups so it was definitely the contact during the boss trip more than the contact in the in the temple although there were as i said there were i think nine or seven uh who got infected outside the boss presumably and all of those who got infected outside the bus had direct contact with the with the index case in the bus during the during the ceremony et cetera great thank you and lynn coleman asked maybe lin you must have read this study but she said um writers sitting by open windows did not get infected however is that correct that i don't know i know they they have the drawings of the of the windows in the bus but i i i don't remember that detail to be honest i don't know lynn are you if you can unmute yourself and did you so much that all those presentations were so fantastic thank you all yeah i thought that study was really fascinating that even the symptomatic patient wasn't coughing he had no symptoms until later his whole family was then infected but nobody in the other bus and each bus had what almost 70 people um so i don't you know it's concerning but i'm trying to think of what we can learn from that because especially with all the fires now we have to be more inside so your advice is appreciated yeah thank you lynn nestor did you have something i i mean one is try to avoid any crowded areas i mean buses restaurants places are closed and if you cannot obviously wear a mask and the other thing is to try to improve the ventilation and it was the same with the example of the restaurant in china um you know if you have a closed uh area if there's any way you can open a couple of windows uh you know to have air circulation air exchange obviously there are ways to to uh to to produce air exchange with special you know air conditioning system and machines and and hepa filter but if you can at least have a ventilator area if you if you that's what i'm telling my colleagues in latin america to try to to instruct people who own restaurants or small businesses to have their doors open especially in tropical climates but you can have the door opens and windows open so there's at least some air circulation within those close places and obviously where where the mask for the varialization too thank you nestor and marla there's a couple of questions you may have seen them in the chat just about for the vaccine or homeless populations in congregate settings going to be um prioritized as well and also a question about domestic violence shelters yeah those other sorts of congregate living settings um might be prioritized in more of the tier two um you know cdc and hhs will really be setting the priorities for tier one um and then as more vaccine becomes available states will have more um ability to influence um and identify priority populations on their own so those are all um settings that we're already talking about people who live in you know any sort of congregate living situation um people who are incarcerated um people who are in different types of shelters um you know also for new mexico we have to think about our american indian and alaska native population as they've been disproportionately impacted and should that be a priority population for vaccines so it's part of what the working group is talking about but initially we won't be setting the priorities at the state level they'll be coming from the federal level but sort of as vaccine availability ramps up and kind of that phase two we'll be able to identify some of our own priorities and those are all areas that we're talking about thank you very much um i wanted just to go to a question for um cecilia cecilia can you enter um thank you cecilia can you end yourself and introduce yourself from tricor yeah my name is cecilia thompson i recently moved here to new mexico and um i will be working with dr carissa culbreth as medical director of infectious disease here great thank you we're really happy to have you um there's a question from our colleague in espanola kim joy asking if we could get an update on the rapid tests for covid how available they are how good they are just any any new knowledge that you have about that sure um there's not a lot to update they are not widely available at this time and it's kind of questionable when they will become widely available as far as the accuracy if you look at the eua and the product information they do tend to make very high claims that they have they're very good but as they move into the general public and and laboratories are able to test them with real patient samples we've seen kind of a wide range of of how well they perform so especially now for the binax that was made some headlines a few weeks ago that is not widely available and it has not been tested in clinical laboratories to verify the claims made of how accurate it is great thank you this comes up almost every monday so i'll be happy to hear an update every every monday about that sure i wanted to go to deborah van willigan from el prado new mexico i don't know if debra if you can meet yourself but just had questions about this i know leslie talked a little bit about long haulers but just whether or not there were uh studies that they could enroll in to sort of look at the impact of postcovid deborah are you yes i am can you hear me yeah okay great so i'm a family medicine doc in towson new mexico and i have two patients one has brain fog and the other one has extreme fatigue and they were ill in march um one of them tried to get tested and wasn't able to because she hadn't traveled but it it all you know they were they had suspicious symptoms and so the question is are there any studies that i can refer them to or any further information on long haulers as it becomes more more known thank you deborah nestor did you have any yeah no i don't have any knowledge of any study here at unm uh i will have to to talk uh uh to dr paratha i think deborah is here also from from the group of the 1209 clinic i mean we are interested we have been following i've been exchanging uh some of the publication with with the group of of the ambulatory internal medicine uh but it's it's something relatively new and i'm not aware of any open enrolling stories i can tell you there have been important publication i was going to share it in the next week and the next monday but i can give you sort of an advance there's a publication in the landsat if i remember correctly about the the brain or neurologic manifestations of of long copy they use uh some sophisticated imaging techniques and also surveys and there's definitely if i remember correctly like around 55 of the patients in that study had some neurological symptoms and and a lot of findings in the imaging they're also been uh cardiac manifestation in athletes there was a publication on 26 uh college uh uh athletes who had some evidence of of cardiac disease so so we are getting more and more information um on on the on the manifestation not only on the subjective you know reported symptoms which are many many there's actually a large survey um like a crowdsourcing survey from university of indiana in which people using an app are are telling their symptoms but there's also a lot of publications on on more uh details on the on the pathophysiological findings on these subjects but not that i i don't think we are doing uh slowly now i know jail university will start um a slowly more than anything looking at the immunological uh alterations we don't know if it's if it's low grade virus replication if it's uh those pieces of rna that we are detecting in the in the in the nasopharyngeal testing if they are stimulating the immune system or it's just a hyperactive immune system and not not really any virus around we don't know what the explanation for this uh uh unusual persistent persistent symptoms are thank you great thank you so much for the all the great questions i'm the joanna katzman here i'm going to take over some of the questioning now um question from mary zeitner says do we have any information about people avoiding medical care secondary to financial reasons i need to see if you've seen that nestor or perhaps leslie hayes has leslie hayes family medicine oh sorry go ahead i have definitely seen patients avoiding medical care because of financial stress and um it's been very hard to get people in for um some testing um especially because of it i have not seen any studies but i gotta believe that's the case nestor what is your thinking about that no i haven't i mean i'm a sober specialist so i don't do primary care but i can tell you from what i have read i remember i think we presented this story on cancer how the cancer incidents went down for several kind is people are not going i'm not searching for the usual you know i don't know if it's for financial reason or for fear of the virus but the results is the same people are delaying the diagnosis and their attendance to to uh to their clinics because of these epidemics so uh it's something really you know worrisome because they're going to present later in the course of their diseases many or with already established a consequence or sequelae thank you both joanna here again um i wanted to ask you a question this is actually from leslie leslie hayes she says i've seen suggestions using um inhaled steroids and out outpatient and is there any evidence for this do you know about that nestor no i haven't reviewed the literature on that specifically i i remember seeing uh some planned stories in clinicaltrial.gov but i haven't seen any published you know large trial of inhaled uh steroids great great um thank you um another question uh is um related to debra von willigan who was just on the phone asked this question about mass and might carbon or other filter mass be helpful um if if uses inserts and have you um seen anything about that nestor no i mean the stories that we have reviewed before there is obviously a difference between the different masks i mean the best to filter everything obviously are the n95 then probably probably next to that is a surgical mask that you know the the professional grade surgical math then the the procedure mask and then you have the whole plethora of other you know cotton with with polyester mask regular mask all the way down to the lowest which is bandanas i remember in one of the studies had the lead the least filtering capacity so there's sort of a you know a very diverse um variety of masks with diverse abilities to filter and there was a paper on these that actually tried to evaluate the the retention of particles with different materials i remember that obviously n95 and surgical mask got the number one into a place in quality thank you nestor um i'm wondering if a dan might be able to come on if he might be able to unmute and ask his questions about the the apps related to contact tracing perhaps marla might have any uh be able to answer that thanks dan hi uh hi thank you all for you for your efforts in this uh i was just um yeah the test test trace and isolate is a is the public health response for cu that involves contact tracing and and apple and and google released these uh bluetooth enabled apps that that that are that supposedly have anonymity built into them in a real integral way and i was wondering if they've been studied at all and if there's um you know and the protocols for test trace and isolate has been a big challenge for public health departments i think and i was wondering if there's been any quality improvement uh efforts in that or like if there's a if there's protocols for that that are becoming best practices and uh lastly about that you know is is it still is it still a viable strategy that just too many you know is the horse out of the barn are there just too many infections to be able to effectively test trace and isolate you know track down the contact is that realistic anymore so um yeah great marla um might you be able to speak to dan's question sure so i think there was a good um article in nature talking about uh the google and apple contact tracing apps and there wasn't any sort of outcome or efficacy data but they did talk about implementation challenges um uptake for this kind of tracing in the united states has not been good people you know have not been motivated or interested in participating in these kind of um location sharing and data sharing um apps for contact tracing so the uptake in the united states has been really challenging so they've not really been rolled out um in a wide you know wide usage the way i think um you know we thought there was promise maybe for them they've there's not been much uptake in the us but there's a good article um in nature about that um that you can read it's really interesting um and i think in terms of contact tracing you know now in new mexico where our case counts are much lower we actually you know have an opportunity for contact tracing to be more effective again to your point when there's widespread um community transmission it's harder to pinpoint you know what the exposures or the contacts might have been but now that um you know our case counts are much lower our test positivity rate is much lower our r effective is below one we really do have the opportunity to identify those transmission events and small clusters and use contact tracing to try to isolate people and prevent further spread so we definitely went through a phase where contact tracing was probably less effective but because we've brought the case counts down significantly contact tracing can be more effective than it was when we were sort of you know at the height of community transmission thanks marlo we're really grateful to how well mexico and new mexico is doing and and it's primarily because of everything you're doing uh doug clark has a question uh uh uh for us and as you know doug works for the state and he says is there any evidence regarding coven risks and obtaining dental care um do you know about that nestor no i i just remember either hearing or or in a postcast or something that the risk is slow that there hasn't been many cases but i i honestly have not reviewed the literature in depth to to give an opinion if somebody else can i don't know for sure but i do know world health organization about a month ago recommended against routine dental care right now so great uh this is joanne i did wanna just mention that jane epstein put a very nice comment in the chat about the the lasting misery of coronavirus long haulers and she also put in the uh the website to the article in nature so thanks for that jane um i'm going to go to one more question and then have a carla follow up after me [Music] um and uh the dental care session settings okay if you wanna i can ask a question tomorrow yes please i i have been following the numbers of the department of health and i see that there were a couple of days that were 30s and 6 and and 40s and then all of a sudden jump to 160 i don't remember exactly the number is there uh some type of periodicity can you comment on that how i mean because for me as a you know as a infectious disease it doesn't make sense to go up and down unless there's a human factor like reports get on monday and wednesday and not every day is the same so can you comment on that right yeah so those case reports that come out each day that are in the press release and updated on our website our test results from that day so they don't correspond to the date the test was collected you do see that in our seven day rolling average and so trying to sort of smooth out those peaks and valleys but when there's a big you know community-wide testing event um you know or those kinds of ramped up test efforts that are happening around the state then we might get a bolus of results that all come in um on one day from a particular lab which you know sort of helps account for that up and down we also have um you know less timely reporting from some out of state reference labs and so sometimes again we'll get a bolus of test results from those laboratories that can span several weeks worth of testing and so they're not always you know the results coming in aren't always related in time to when the test was collected so that's why we use test collection date in that seven day rolling average and in the reproductive rate calculation to try to account for those differences and smooth out those daily ups and downs thank you marla back to you carla thank you very much i wanted to actually go back to um to cecilia thompson at tricor one of the questions that came in in the pre-registration was about the how quickly the testing people are getting their test results back and i know you don't know the answer for all of the but in terms of tri-core what is the turnaround time for for copa test at this point it kind of depends a little bit on who's being tested for patients that are having that are getting a test pre-procedure as a screening measure to determine how much ppe needs to be worn those have a general turnaround of three days but in experience there from my experience at least and i've only been at tricor a few weeks now there resulted um prior to their resulted before that 3 72 hour window um all the other testing um again in my kind of limited experience here at tricor has been um give or take about 24 hours great thank you so much marla i don't know if you have anything to add to that in terms of what what how fast you guys are getting turned around for when when you're doing um investigations if you can comment on that and also can you comment on whether um there's a recommendation for testing asymptomatic individuals who've been exposed yes so um despite the confusing information that cdc released about people who've been exposed not necessarily needing to be tested it still is our recommendation from the department of health that contacts of known cases and people with known exposures be tested regardless of symptoms so that recommendation from the department of health hasn't changed i know it's been more difficult for asymptomatic people to be tested through some of the hospital-led testing events they've kind of shifted their focus to more symptomatic testing or testing for you know pre-procedure and other reasons but asymptomatic testing for anyone is available at all of the public health offices throughout the state and marla what is the turnaround time for those tests yeah so turnaround time at the state lab is really good right now i've seen tests come back um you know in as few as about 12 hours depending you know what time of day the the specimen arrives at the lab if it makes it into the morning batch they can turn around pretty quickly but you know 24 to 36 hours for at the state lab seems to be about typical right now and that's from the time the specimen arrives at the lab so i know there's always a lot of variability um in testing that's done you know the lab is in albuquerque sometimes transit can be a day or more depending where the specimen is coming from so you have to factor that in but once it reaches the lab right now the state lab is able to turn around pretty quickly great thank you and that's interesting because i have a family member who is quite symptomatic awaiting covet test results and she's currently over 96 hours and hasn't gotten the results yet through um i believe president sending them to tri-course so um there are definitely delays some places yeah correct and i know um i don't want to speak for tri-core but i know that there you know continue to be um problems with uh laboratory supplies reagents and other lab supplies that have impacted turnaround time um you know at different laboratories thank you very much um i just wanted to remind everybody that the the cme link just went into the chat about 12 45 so if you're interested in getting see me please go ahead and fill that out and also even if you don't want to see me we would love to hear from you so if you if you would fill that up that would be great there's a very interesting question that was sent through the pre-registration from deborah mccreath from ohio asking why does anyone think that an effective vaccine can be created in nine months when it usually takes much longer than that to to actually test to create and test a vaccine so maybe nestor maybe you can approach that one yeah i'm gonna get into trouble with this answer but yeah i i mean there's things have moved really fast with the kobe 19 that's you know i never seen that i worked in vaccines for works in research um in my country for many years and yes they take forever we still don't have an effective vaccine for malaria or for hiv uh or for herpes there are many many diseases that are very prevalent and we don't have a commercially available vaccine they're still on the research and these diseases have been known for many years so it's true that the premise of the question is absolutely true but i think everything is different with kobe 19 i mean people are really putting a lot of uh money and effort in developing a vaccine and right now they're like between eight and nine vaccines that are starting human trials phase three human trials they've already gone through phase one and two and they're more than i i lost count but the last time i saw 132 that were on human already starting human testing in phase one two so there's a lot of a lot of work a lot of uh stories going on um regarding the phase three stories i i am a little bit um uh hesitant to believe that we're going to have an of an available vaccine by october or by the end of october most of the scientists that i follow like on on on on social media or podcasts etc um they have their questions because if you imagine if you're enrolling in a phase three study now and it's a two dose vaccine i mean if you put the first dose in september you're gonna put the the second dose probably in the middle of october and then you have to wait for some time to eat for events to occur to those who have received the placebo so unless the vaccinated person is in the middle of a of a very active uh community outbreak uh they may not have time to to catch kobe 19 enough to be to to to be enough numbers uh to make up a significant statistically significant difference between them the placebo group and the vaccine group so so it's hard to imagine and and and some of the critiques that have been voiced by the scientific community is that we don't know what's going to be considered a successful and effective or safe vaccine because the stopping rule has are not very clear uh so so there's a lot of questioning going back and forth we'll just have to wait i heard the i think it was the pfizer ceo saying that yeah they're going to have some information by the end of october so so who knows and and there's so many things in the in the in discussion right now or that it's it's it's somewhat controversial but we have to see but i'm i'm i'm kind of you know i don't i'm not sure we're going to have an answer by the end of october but maybe i'm wrong and we are depending on what criteria they use for efficacy and safety with all these vaccines that are moving at really really really fast speed okay thank you very much and then i think we have one more ques one one last question is there any updated information on the theory of possible reinfection or secondary infection for those who've had it um previously dr seibold was asking that question right no i haven't seen anything i saw the the you know the paper by the group in hong kong who actually published the story of that person and then the comments on the reno nevada patient but i haven't seen any anything anything else there was a a nice uh review paper on the path up for immunity it's called the path to immunity i think it's i don't remember if it's the lancer or i think it was i think it was lancet that i really recommend for people to read about how we understand now about immunity to this virus because it's related to this this aspect of reinfection um so but but i haven't seen any any new like really headlines on on reinfection after those those two cases that i mentioned the renal case and the hong kong case great thank you dr so thank you everyone for joining is really really happy and thank you so much to our subject matter experts this really excellent um uh session today just a couple of announcements before we leave again if you'd like to see me please um link go to the link in the chat i mean if you were unable to get your question in today please come back next week and we'll try to answer it at that point um the credit there's a critical care echo tele echo session on thursday it's now the first and third i believe anyway it's two times a month whatever this this upcoming um thursday is the the session is about hospital testing and reinfection and um dr megan brett is gonna give a talk during that echo so that should be good it's from eight to nine on thursday morning and um if you want additional information please go to the website and you can see what other echoes are available for you to join that are related to covid19 and with that i think we will close the session and thank you everyone for joining we'll see you in a week carla if i could make a brief request um ms leslie hayes what i'd really love to make a presentation on is a protocol for what we're going to do with all the snot and those little kids this winter if we're going to be testing every time the toddler gets a fever and runny nose which with my kids would have meant i was testing them twice a month and i cannot find a protocol anywhere so if anyone finds a protocol if you would send it to me i would be very grateful because i'd love to present something on that because i'm actually not quite sure how to approach that so yeah yeah absolutely let us know or marla if you have maybe martha's thought about this but maybe we can talk about it next week thank you everyone\"\n",

      "Text: \"office hours tele echo session we're really happy to see everybody today um i just have a couple of quick announcements before we get started with our presentations uh my name is carla thornton i'm one of the associate directors here at project echo and i'll be facilitating this session along with my colleague joanna katzman who i don't see yet joanna are you there yes oh hi there hi everybody yes i'm joanna katzman here from project echo and unm welcome thank you joanna uh we just ask everyone if as usual if they have a camera to turn it on we'd love to see your faces if you have a camera and you can turn it on during the session we would we would very much appreciate that if you have questions for the hub team members during the presentation please put them into the chat and we'll try to get to as many questions as we can today uh we also have our digital librarian who will be putting information into the chat during the session that you can click on and save um a lot of really great information gets put into the chat so keep an eye on that as well and without further ado i'm going to turn it over to um nestor sosa who can introduce himself and go ahead and proceed with this presentation yes thank you carla and joanna i'm nestor sosa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm uh hospital uh let me share my screen i'm gonna go over my my update today and hello everyone see if i can put this in the big screen there you go display setting all right i'm ready now so okay so first of all i'm gonna actually there were more interesting news than articles over this weekend so many things were communicated in the late press so i just want to go over some of those things in case you you didn't hear some of these news and most are related to vaccine and vaccine success first of all there was an announcement that now the pfizer vaccine one of the mrna vaccine do not need the -70-80 for storage so the at least the european amazing agency approve the the request from pfizer to to use -25 which is sort of a pharmacy standard pharmacy refrigerator and blood bank refrigerator also so so that's that makes it a little bit easier to store and and distribute these uh vaccines uh there were other news on pfizer and i want to go over them um i have obviously no no conflict of interest but there were a couple of really dramatic um developments first of all good news for the kids 12 to 15 years old pfizer announced the preliminary results we have to wait for the publication but the phase three that included over uh 2200 uh 12 to 15 year old and the vaccine showed an effect efficacy for symptomatic disease of a hundred percent so there were 18 cases in the placebo group zero cases and the vaccine groups so very highly efficacious and in fact they mentioned also in in in passing in this in this news um outlet that the the antibodies produced by the kids were even higher than the 16 to 25 year olds so so they do have the amount of robust uh antibody uh response to the mrna vast into this specific mrna vaccine so good news and and they they already started enrolling they enrolled the first uh patient in the six month to eleven years so though those trials are already ongoing and they have enrolled the first few kids in that trial so good news f for for that part of the trial and that group which is needed for the hurt immunity the other part is that they they actually commented on the on the duration of the antibody respawn and duration of protection for this same uh pfizer vaccine and they actually mentioned that an in analysis six months after uh vaccination the the efficacy against symptomatic disease remains over 90 91.3 they found 850 cases in the placebo group versus 777 so almost 10 times more cases in the placebo than in the vaccine group i'm sorry and when they look at severe disease there was a hundred percent efficacy no severe disease in those vaccinated although there were some cases of mild disease there were zero uh in the vaccine group which is really encouraging and for me the most encouraging of all news is that they uh they mentioned that in in this follow-up of the large trial they have 800 subjects enrolled in south africa which is as you know the area where the 351 um variant of concern is circulating and this is the most troublesome we have look at some laboratory data with this strain the 351 the b11351 strain and they found much to my surprise and the surprise of many 100 vaccine efficacy although we have been showing data that the neutralizing antibody is it's lower it's lower uh but they they were they had zero cases in the vaccine group in this group in these patients in south africa versus nine in the placebo for for obviously we need to wait for the full publication of these sort of extension of the of the large 46 000 subjects but it's it's definitely encouraging remember that other vaccines have not fared that well against the variant and in fact over the last few days they published the data on the this is the shadows one which is the astra seneca oxford vaccine and was essentially useless against the south african strain if you remember this is the graph that usually separates the vaccine from placebo the famous crab that i have shown for modernity and pfizer where here it doesn't separate so the cases in both group vaccine and placebo are essentially the same in fact the the efficacy was around 10 only for the for the oxford vaccine against the b1351 variant so so just to to compare 100 versus in this case 10 of efficacy so obviously um no no efficacy there for the for the astra seneca against this new new barrier as opposed to the preliminary uh news report uh i want to emphasize that news report of of 100 efficacy against the south african with the mrna vaccine and i haven't really mentioned much about the sputnik which is another vaccine that is being used and actually it's been used a lot in latin america several countries have already uh negotiated with the with the russian government the implementation of these and and these authors which are independent of the of the company of the gamalia uh institute actually did uh what we have been presenting here they took uh serum from patients who have been immunized fully immunized with the sputnik and they um compare the neutralizing activity of their serum against the different variant this is the uk or b117 wild type which is basically the original wuham virus and the african and and this one is just a mu with one mutation the the 484k which is the escape variant that they have identified and again um there's a significant impact in the neutralizing activity uh against um the the uh south african variant as opposed to the other and you may ask why why the difference well the only difference that i could really find why the astra seneca and this one well besides the fact that they are both um they're both adenovirus vaccine as opposed to naked mrna vaccines the other thing is that they use the the mrna vaccines when they they synthetize the spike protein the spy protein is in the prefusion it's like locked in the prefusion um conformation because they added two prolines amino acid uh in this and that and that's a proprietary um you know thing so so both um moderna and pfizer and and even johnson and johnson bought this this uh modified spike protein to keep it in the in the prefusion and presumably in that prefusion generates more antibodies more robust than just a naturally occurring uh spike protein which folds itself and goes into the tertiary uh structure which seems to induce less of a powerful response so that that's what the scientists are speculating that maybe although all of these vaccines generate the synthesis of spike protein there's there's some ultra structural differences especially in the in the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein that may be giving us a difference again these variants well stay tuned we'll we'll see that uh but this again this is spoken but in the lab not spoken clinically we haven't seen any data of the spokenig in south africa this is just using uh virus in the laboratory or pseudo-virus in the laboratory okay there were a couple of publications so much for the for the news and comparison with other some publications on real life effectiveness of the mrna vaccine i think two or three papers that basically show the the the real life activity and one i think was mentioned by dr sivers last week this is the mnwr publication that she mentioned and and it shows uh essentially a 90 um effectiveness because this is this is real life so we use the word effectiveness as opposed to efficacy or efficacy um for the fully immunized 14 days after the second dose they saw a 90 uh decrease in the in the in the in the cases of of of kobe 19 among those vaccinated in eight locations within the united states from basically the start of vaccination middle of december to the middle of march um so so good news this is uh a pretty large study showing real life benefit of the vaccine another really impressive and this is visually impressive this is just um from one medical center here in the us and and actually you can see the dots here are the cases in healthcare worker how they were increasing uh throughout november and december there was a the the famous second peak in in this center and it could have been i mean should should have gone continually up and up the number of cases but then they started vaccination here in the middle of december and you can see how the dots go down significant to the point that in mid-february there were barely a few cases of covet among the healthcare worker and you can see here numerically 2.2 of the healthcare worker testing positive then 1.82 shortly after they started vaccination when they were partially vaccinated and and 0.05 percent when they um they were fully vaccinated so really a dramatic collapse in the number of cases showing obviously or we have already seen in other in other settings the the degree of protection from disease that these vaccines usually confer and finally another similar study in this case from healthcare workers in california another store this was published in the new england journal and you can see as the as the day after vaccination with the first dose and second those go by you can see the numbers how they're basically you know uh being smaller and smaller to the point that 15 days after vaccination there were only seven cases out of four thousand that were tested in these in this uh in this setting um if you want to be a pessimist or or sort of careful person you have to say well there's still vaccinated people who get the the disease and it's true seven out of four thousand uh tested positive despite being fully vaccinated so that's that's the importance of not dropping your guard uh before knowing that you can still have infection although presumably most of the data shows less severe disease uh even lower viral loads in some of the studies but you still can see some so you shouldn't be surprised if you hear or read about a person who was fully vaccinated but develop kobe because it's not a hundred percent as we know really well but definitely an impressive also decrease in the new infections in this cohort of healthcare workers and this paper actually leslie hayes suggested that i presented this paper and it was really interesting and the question of this paper is um is vaccine immunity superior to natural infection and we we have been sort of hinting that that's probably true but this this paper really show show it graphically very nicely so this is a research letter published in yama uh just a few days ago neutralizing antibodies against our scoby two variants after infection and vaccination so what they did they took serum from infected patients acutely infected patients convalescent patients all in the u.s and vaccinated individuals with mrna vaccines and then they they measured the neutralization capacity against the different variants and you you're probably very familiar because we have presented this a1 and b1 are sort of the wild type a and b clades this is the uk variant which is very prevalent now in the united states and this is a laboratory produced variant with just one mutation the 5 0 1 which is the mutation that is seen in several of the of the variants of concern and you can see that infected patient convalescence individuals have you know a pretty decent 10 to the two neutralization levels but the vaccinated it's 10 to the 3 so so basically 10 times higher against all of the variants that were studied in this trial so definitely this this study shows that the immunity against all the neutralization antibodies are are it's higher or the neutralization activity is higher when you receive the vaccine as opposed to an acute infected patient or a convalescent individual so and that's one of the reasons why people with college should be uh vaccinated because they they're going to get a sort of a booster a better um immune response than they if they just had the natural infection so that that's i think striking but it definitely proves that at least the quantitative difference in the antibody production between one group and the other uh which is which is i think it's it's important uh to demonstrate and finally this is basically i think in one of the previous office hours we we asked about the risk of uh severe coping in asthmatics and and we we mentioned that that what we have seen is that it doesn't raise the risk that much um so the the the uk and these authors from the uk actually did a very nice population-based study in which they took uh from several primary care clinics they took the diagnosis of the patient with respiratory disease so they had a whole group of patients with different diseases and then they compared the or they look into the the national database of copy cases and they cross these two databases from primary care and from covet hospitalizations and that and the interesting finding was despite you know what when common sense may indicate respiratory disease especially asthma uh either asthma in general active asthma or severe asthma was not a significant risk factor for death uh due to kobe then this is what we mentioned before but it was sort of confirmed by these by this story only you know five percent increased risk thirteen percent increase risk of death um if you compare with all age or diabetes uh are much more uh high associated with a higher hazard ratio of death and icu than and even some of these other diseases like copd 1.55 the only one i think it was undefined interstitial lung disease and lung cancer were twice um a slightly of dyeing of cobalt if they if they got copied and had that underlying condition than many of the other respiratory diseases that are listed here so that was sort of interesting um i mean it probably doesn't change practice but at least we can we can reassure the patients with copd and asthma that they are not at a dramatically increased risk of of suffering severe cavity if they if they get caught um so that was i think it was an interesting finding and finally this is my last paper it's kind of a nice color paper uh it was a also a research letter um published i think in jama in which they they analyze analyze the excess death from kobe 19 and other causes in the u.s and i think leslie is going to talk about causes of death during the the kobe epidemic but they found a 22 almost 23 percent excess debt so there were 30 uh i mean sorry 33 more people dying than than expected in the year of the of the pandemic from march to january march 2020 to january 2021 obviously uh non-hispanic blacks were disproportionately affected uh sixty percent of those success death uh uh were among among um non-hispanic blacks and this is more than what they are in the general population um um 72 percent of these deaths were due to covet obviously the majority of them but not of them there was also increases in death in alzheimer's heart disease and diabetes um independent obviously of the covet but but due to probably lack of access or or or some difficulties obtaining care for these diseases and interestingly enough unfortunately we are in the top the the paper side the 10 highest states with per capita excess debt and mississippi new years in new york arizona alabama luciana south dakota and new mexico north dakota and ohio are there in the top 10 of of excess death as a state in the in in here in the united states and it was also interesting to see graphically the shape of the of the pandemic in the different regions like in the new england and northeast was clearly a huge peak when new york was affected and the northeast at the beginning of the year and another smaller peak in december as opposed to south uh east and southwest the more warmer areas there was a huge peak in the summer that we remember and then the large also uh spike in the in the at the end of the year so completely different uh epidemic from from the northeast here in the south southwest and southeast and you can see this great lakes here and rocky mountains and others here so very interesting population also based epidemiological paper recommended reading uh there is a there's an article about how copy it affects the brain it's really short it's almost one page but it has this complicated but nice um illustration of the different hypothesis how covet actually affects the brain um and obviously enters the the endothelial cells produces the you know production of cytokines and the pro and these cytokines tend to activate the micro glia and then there's changes in the neurotransmitter and they go on to explain the changes in this neurotransmitter and how they uh they produce toxicity in the brain excito toxicity and hypoxic injury there's also the the traumas phenomenon or the the strokes that occur so very nice article just to to take a good idea how acutely and also chronically we see this patient with brain fog and lack of concentration and other cns events explained in this yama psychiatry article and finally this is this is a very practical there was a perspective article on how to address um vaccine hesitancy in in black indigenous population and people of color um and and you know what i like about this these uh perspective was that they they presented a table and it's larger than this this is just a piece of the table um with all the questions or other relevant questions that people may ask you about the vaccine and how you know the the explanation for those questions in a in an easy to understand uh transparent and and uh and and good way to explain it so i found very useful i think you know anybody who takes care of of a patient that may be hesitant to receive the vaccine should go through this questionnaire and actually uh try to explain to the patients why vaccines are safe why it has been stolen etc so it's very interesting it was published in the new england journal on march 31st that's it thank you thank you very much jester for that awesome presentation um leslie can you go ahead and introduce yourself hi leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine in espanola and i'm just going to be doing a quick primary care update today i was very sad when i found that article that people who had had copa did not have better immunity than people who were vaccinated i thought i should at least get some some benefit out of it but i guess not so although it is a superpower when it comes to talking people into getting the vaccine because i just smile very sweetly and say you know i've had covet and i would really recommend against getting it and people listen to that um so um i also i'm talking about an article about leading causes of death and for um all of 2020 coveted actually the number three cause of death there were 345 000 deaths in 2020 it was behind heart disease and cancer and it was largely responsible for the substantial increase in death heart disease deaths increased by 4.8 percent which was the highest increase since 2012 also occurred for unintentional injury 11 alzheimer's and diabetes the increase was likely due to less preventative care um some of them we wonder what the heart disease and diabetes make more people develop those whether or not cobit actually could have had an effect directly there as well and the number of deaths occurring in the us among us residents was 3.3 million which was an increase of almost 18 from 2.8 million in 2019 so a really substantial increase and this is just shows the us and you can see there's the initial peak here in march and then in july then again um at the end of the year and i thought this was interesting if you look at the causes of death and um as we mentioned heart disease did go up cancer did not unintentional injuries went up and unfortunately they didn't separate out as to whether it was car accidents or overdose i know i've heard overdose death rates definitely went up and i had heard for a while that accidental um deaths have gone down and i would like to know what the final numbers for the year were but that wasn't in there one thing that though um i think we should point out is that suicide deaths actually went down and i heard over and over and i don't know about the rest of you that um lockdowns were causing an increase in suicide and fortunately that did not turn out to be true suicide deaths were actually down for 2020. and next i this one i'm presenting just because of a patient i had two weeks ago i had a man in his 70s come in to the clinic to get copic vaccine he had a history of well-controlled hypertension and right after he got the vaccine he told the medical assistant that he felt floaty she um checked his blood pressure which had been well controlled we didn't check it before he got the vaccine but at that time he had a pulse of 45 and a blood pressure of 196 over 110 um this was about 10 minutes after the vaccine we repeated it about 10 minutes later it was 200 over 120 with a pulse of 42. um ekg was started some stt wave changes he was sent to the er he had a negative cardiac workup that improved um but not normalizing of his blood pressure and i don't know whatever ended up happening but then this article popped up in my feed and it was a case series in hypertension which is a publication american heart association and they had nine patients who had stage three hypertension documented within minutes of vaccination eight of them were symptomatic i have no idea why they checked the ninth they didn't say median h was 73 um seven females two males um eight of the nine patients had a prior history of hypertension most were on high blood pressure medications most were observed for several hours in the emergency room there were not any sequelae for any of them um mechanism was unclear they did feel unlikely stressed all of them had a normal heart rate as i mentioned my gentleman actually had a low heart rate and they did recommend consider checking blood pressure or monitor for symptoms um in elderly patients with hypertension we have not changed anything we've done in my clinic yet and i haven't seen any official recommendations on what to do nor do i know if this is going to be just a few weird cases or if it's actually a true side effect from the vaccine certainly since it's not an anaphylactic reaction there's no recommendation not to repeat the vaccine for the second dose and then burnout and sleep deprivation are not good for you they did an article on covet 19 i'm looking at healthcare workers and whether or not we were getting enough sleep and whether or not we were burned out and from july 17 to the 25th um of september in 2020 they did a web-based survey to 2884 healthcare workers in six different countries who had a high frequency of workplace exposure they provided information on their demographics their sleep number of hours that they slept at night whether or not they were napping in the daytime and if they had any sleep problems if they were burned out from work and what their covered 19 exposures were there were 568 cobia 19 cases um 2300 controls and one hour longer sleep duration at night was associated with twelve percent lower autocova 19 probability was good having no sleep problems having all three sleep problems was associated with an 88 percent greater chance of getting covered um reporting burnout date every day was associated with greater odds of covet 19 2.6 times as likely longer duration 2.98 times as likely and severity 3.26 compared with reporting no burnout i will point out that this likelihood is um higher than dr sosa just pointed out for lung disease so i'm going to say everybody on here after we're done you can take the afternoon off please go take a nap and do something that you find really fun doctor's orders and then just interesting things um one in five cobot affected healthcare workers ways quitting in a study which i just found very bothersome i know we have had a lot more turnover at my clinic since uh cobit started and it just seems like many many people are just ready to toss it in after this and then this article actually make me more concerned than any of the um official medical stuff i've read which is i have heard that they were having an outbreak in british columbia rated i can't remember which of the variants it's related to but half of the vancouver canucks um players have tested positive for cobit 19 and apparently some of them are quite sick none of them are hospitalized yet that we know of um but they've required iv fluids and other treatments so and then this was just a useful summary if anybody um wants to give it to friends who are still not completely sure but how does covet 19 spread the top five things everyone should know and then the last one is vaccine cheat days are adding up and this just basically talks about we can kind of see the end in sight and people are like almost there so it's like you know i've only had one vaccine and um but i'm getting the next one next week so i think i can go ahead and socialize it just it was really a good reminder that we need to keep doing what we're doing until things have really gotten better so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie i wanted just to ask um i don't believe that carissa is on but cecilia thompson is on from tricor infectious diseases cecilia if you had any updates from tricor or from laboratory updates i don't have any updates but i'm happy to take any questions great thank you very much and our um marla sivers is not on yet but she says that she's gonna try to get on later so if you have any public health questions just hold them till the end and i'm gonna turn it over to joanna to go ahead and proceed with the questions thanks carla thanks nestor thanks leslie um okay um lots of great questions and thanks for the amazing presentations nestor and leslie um harry seibold um says uh is wonder wondering to know uh nestor do you think uh um emergency use authorization uh to the fda is forthcoming regarding 12 to 15 year olds um due to the pfizer study showing amazing efficacy or effectiveness and that's another of dr seibel's question by the way too is kind of what is the difference between efficacy and effectiveness yeah i i don't know i mean how soon it's going to be i know they are working on that but i think and they had the data ready when they did the first eua but the discussion they actually took out the 12 to 15 year old because they had that data ready to present way back in december so my my feeling is that yes it's going to be uh a proof but but really i i i don't know how soon it's going to be but i know the pfizer is pushing for that and they're actually enrolling in the younger group this group is already finished and follow so so they're probably gonna go ahead and push especially with these outstanding results no i forgot to mention but there was no safety issues they didn't see anything anything uh you know dramatic with regarding safety in that group and and then the high efficacy and high antibody levels so i don't see a reason why not to be honest and then the difference between efficacy and effectiveness efficacy is usually used when when you do a trial it's in a controlled environment with you know placebo against placebo in a research setting and effectiveness is in vaccination or vaccinology is used when you measure the the the activity of the vaccine in the real life in the community in your hospital but not within a strict control randomized trial would actually be seen in in real people with you know all sorts of underlying diseases underlying risk factors um an actual implementation of the of the vaccine in the in the routine so that when you get the results of that you you talk about effectiveness when it's in coming from a trial you you talk about efficacy it's confusing but that's that's sort of the international uh standard for for terminology with vaccine efficacy and effectiveness thank you nestor i think all of a sudden on the echo should try to leverage to get you on that on the fda vaccine committee i think you're i think you're the country's expert right now i think we need to get you so you can approve i'm super i'm too pro vaccine i would approve everything that they put in front of me i just want to get this epidemic finished okay um dan um dan saltman do you want to unmute and ask your question about the case fatality uh rates sure thanks joanna uh i yeah so the case fatality rate is a number that i think was hard to come by early on because people just didn't know and then when it's when people are vaccinated or the vaccines start rolling out it it affects that case fatality rate but do we have a sense of what the sars cov2 virus case fatality rate is a kind of estimate of it now that it's been a while that it's been out in the in the world and and uh you know and how does that compare with with influenza that was kind of the original one of the original discussions and i was wondering now there's been enough time that's passed maybe we got a sense about what the what the real case fatality rate is right yeah that's a great question and it's a moving target and and i i tried to explain why uh first of all because k authority rate uh it's just the people who are diagnosed and and die uh that's that's the case fatality rate um and diagnosed with a clinical disease so so and that definition has changed because when you start doing like at the beginning there were few testing so we were only seeing those hospitalized with severe disease so the case fatality rate was high because you the the denominator were people who were in the hospital with severe disease so the case fatality rate was higher when you start to include in the case fatality rate mild cases people who are not hospitalized and if you include asymptomatic cases the case fatality rate basically drops um so i've seen ranges from like 0.8 0.7 to 2.6 which was the highest number that i saw during the the the epidemic so it's i would say it's slightly below one percent the case fatality rate but it depends on many factors you know what you're putting in the denominator what your population is if you have all elderly people it's going to be higher if you include only young people it's going to be lower uh so it depends on in the area uh where you're doing the the the studies like and it's completely different in every age group and you know in younger groups it's much lower than older groups um over over 80 it's if the case fatality rate goes to 20 25 i seen if you're over 80 and get copied as opposed to if you're 19 years old it's probably less than 1.13 so it's it's a huge gap between the the different ages and risk factors thank you for the question dr saltman thanks nestor um uh carol miller asked a really good question in that how is the large decrease in in testing i think in certain states uh definitely affecting the outcomes um or the effectiveness of the data that we're seeing um uh with the you know reduction of the testing and i don't necessarily if you want to weigh in as well as nestor um so i'll let nestor weigh in but i think if marlo are here she might be a good one to answer this because the decrease in testing means that we are doing less surveillance less contact tracing and it's really important from that public health point of view yeah i totally agree i mean the definitely if if you decrease testing um you know you're not going to have a like a realistic measure of the pandemic and there are several factors i mean with the vaccinated population increasing those cases are going to be asymptomatic or possibly fortunately enough but then we're not going to detect them because even in adults it could be a mild disease and they may not get tested so that it's really complicating the the testing issue uh on the good news side is that the fda uh recently gave authorization to a couple of home-based testing so they're even pcr testing so there are a couple of of new uh easier to get testings in hopefully in the future so people will be able to to buy it and do and then confirm it if it's positive so that's that's sort of a move in the right direction and there have been a couple of um very vocal epidemiologists michael mina from harvard who has been advocating for like aggressive testing you know like almost every other day testing for for people who are in congregate settings or going to places or going to concerts etc to try to test as much as you can as frequent as you can to detect those asymptomatic or or pre-symptomatic cases and i think that's you know at some point if we have inexpensive rapid home tests maybe more feasible than than before that you have to go to one of the places where they test and you have to get in your car and do the you know the usual uh to be tested so um it's it's a reality but there's a concern that because of the feeling that the pandemic is going away there's a decreased intestine in some areas so hopefully that will will not have an effect on the on the overall you know course of the pandemic i will see great um there's a couple questions from carla and leslie on the juggle on work the lumping of the under accidental deaths and drug overdoses and and leslie do you want to maybe clarify that regarding your um excess death study sure so they lumped the um intention unintentional injuries together which was the vast majority of that is overdoses in car accidents um and we know that stayed about steady my guess is that accidents went down and drug overdoses went up and laura tomati just pushed or put something in the chat saying um essentially that but i haven't had a chance to actually read it i was just about to look at it when you asked so um but um i have generally heard that overdose death rates were up for 2020 and car accidents down thank you leslie um there's a there's several vaccine questions and i think we might wait to see if marla comes on the line um uh follow me family asks a question i might just read it if a patient develops a significant reaction like fever aches headaches etc but not anaphylaxis four hours after the covert vaccine should they get the second one wanted to ask you nestor or leslie your thoughts on that yes yes what the cdc says it's just allergic reaction so it's just if it's sort of sort of a reactogenic event with fever malaise um definitely should get the second dose that would suggest to me if it's with the first dose that they had copied before because people would call it tend to have a more severe first dose reaction than those who are naive to the virus or to the spy protein but but yeah i think it's not a contraindication if it's just fever malaise fatigue pain in the area of injection as opposed to like you know anaphylactic reaction or laryngeal edema urticaria hypotension which are indications of a more you know histamine or some type of allergic media type one allergic reaction in which the second dose is contraindicated uh can people go with a different type of vaccine can they go with jnj or could they go with the other mrna vaccine or is it just recommended not to give another vaccine right i haven't seen that answer specifically it makes sense uh if it's not the same platform and not the same ingredients in the vaccine but i i i've seen that they should not receive the second dose that's what i have read but i haven't seen the recommendation or jump into another another platform as of yet i don't know if anybody else have seen it but i haven't uh thank thank you nestor and leslie um i just have one more question i'm going to turn it over to carl after that um i i've heard i heard on the news yesterday a couple of times about the you know these outbreaks not in new mexico but in michigan in philadelphia and other parts of the country where they're actually increasing uh the transmission you know at greater rates and they're much more increased about a fourth uh fourth wave um than we are in new mexico even and the idea about ring vaccination meaning getting people around this kind of really tackling the the surge in those areas more quickly and just wanted to get your thoughts on that yeah i mean that makes sense i mean we have done it for like yellow fever outbreaks uh in africa and brazil that if you have an area with cases you'd go and do like an intensive vaccination regardless of age exposures risk factors so at least it make we have precedent or it makes sense from a public health but it also depends on how how much how many doses of vaccines you have what's your you know logistic uh availability of nurses or vaccinators etc so but yeah it's been done with epidemics before in which you create like a circle of vaccination around a community or an area that is heavily affected you neglect the areas where there's no circulation and just concentrate all your resources there and there are many things that we are not doing and i was reading a piece in the new york times um you know like there are things like delay in the second dose the uk is doing that we're not um even using a smaller dose there's phase two study with smaller doses of moderna and pfizer that are effective so we you know it's just that we don't um we're using the regular dose because that's what the fda says but in cases of emergency you can you can use half of the dose you can space the second dose and vaccinate more people more rapidly so but i think because we are so you know following the rules which is good um and it um there's no flexibility in in our in our you know actions but but it's it's interesting that other countries or other healthcare system are using these strategies to really maximize the number of people we know that with one dose of the mrnas you get eighty percent protection so uh which is even higher than than some of the two doses uh than virus vaccine so um you know in in if i were the epidemiologist in a case like that i would probably try to open the discussion of my my advisors on that if those strategies are valid thank you nestor so much back to you carla thank you i'm just on that subject mr the there's a question from andrew ondo is there any discussion about giving postcode patients only one vaccine injection versus two as the immune response is dramatic dramatically higher than with just one yeah i i haven't seen here in the us except for like the twitter feeds there are some experts who are actually advocating for that but i can tell you uh because i know there are a couple of countries already that have officially approved just one those for postcode vaccination to try to use the second dose or the other dose for for our patients who have not had infections so but i guess yeah the discussion is probably taking place but i i i have not been invited to those discussions but i can tell you that like in my country in panama there's only we're recommending only one of those based on the on the data that we have seen and i think there are one or two countries in the in the european union which are also advocating for single dose after covet and it makes sense at least from the neutralizing antibody levels are higher than a person who gets two doses so if you have copied one dose that combination is produces higher um geometric minimum neutralization than two doses of copied in a naive patient so you know probably there's a question about durability but at least for the short run you can delay that second dose and use it for another person for another uh you know a naive person that has not developed coffee and that may may have a high risk of getting sick from it so for me it makes sense but i haven't really seen any official work from cdc or fda or or any any of the official bodies here in the in the us okay great thank you and before we leave vaccine there's just so many vaccine questions but um maria garcia lanosa asked about is there any information on the sputnik vaccine and the p1 strain from brazil have you heard anything about that nester no i have not i have not uh no i just the paper that i presented which basically shows some decrease in the level but i haven't seen any any any uh on that just the comment is that that you know if what i have seen and read about the the different spy protein which i mentioned during the presentation is that the spike protein that is produced um with the astrosenica and with the with the spookney vaccine is slightly different to the mrna to this to the spy protein that is produced with it with the mrna with the johnson and johnson vaccine because it has doesn't have those two proteins that make it stable uh and and in the prefusion conformation so i don't know if that's going to be the the difference at the end explaining the difference in immuno immunogenicity and and protection but it's it's an interesting you know structure uh efficacy correlation that i that i thought it was interesting great thank you and fred fox has a really great question about the efficacy studies for vaccines fred do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question if not i can ask ask it yeah in many of the studies whether they're looking at efficacy or efficient uh effectiveness it's only reporting neutralizing antibodies yet um in an individual's response it really depended not just on this but on non-neutralizing antibodies and their opsonification signaling on the cell mediated response and all the cd4 and cd8 and also the innate immune response so are these other immune responses actually being measured especially when looking at the vaccines because their profound effectiveness would imply that either these other systems are being activated or somehow the interaction between them is being maximized yeah excellent question i mean in in this uh like rapid publication that we have shared about um impact of variance on the on the vaccination i haven't seen any data uh from the t cell response or other parts of the immune system they they have really concentrated neutralizing antibodies um and and not in the other aspect which are which which should or may play a role in the immune response so i they did they did show t-cell responses in the original phase two and phase three trials so if you go back and you look at the phase two trials they they they have the neutralizing but they also showed how uh t1 respond t1h response was was induced by this vaccine because we wanted to for for it to be t1 as opposed to t2 uh th1 as opposed to th2 because of the previous uh bad experiences with with vaccines that induce tt th2 which is associated with like worsening disease or or enhancement of the disease with vaccination but i haven't seen the correlation or the activity of the variants with t-cells i haven't read that much interesting there's a paper that i'm probably going to review next week they did an experiment with macaques with uh with monkeys basically and they they depleted them of t-cells and they compare uh they're neutralizing antibodies and they found interestingly enough to surprise of all of the commentators of that paper that t-cell was not important for neutralizing antibodies so so you know the question is are we overstating the importance of t cells it's i mean it's just one paper it's in monkeys not in humans um but it's interesting and i'll discuss that finding it's completely surprising finding the the the t cell apparently are not as important as we thought because these monkeys have no t cells no cd4 no cda and they were able to mount a pretty decent response with the vaccination uh so that's that was sort of you know really surprising i think the authors thought that it was going to be the other way around that the monkeys were not going to be able to be immunized because they have no t cells and and and it didn't it didn't work that way it was the other way around it was a pretty decent response without t cells so we'll see it's in it it's an interesting a good question but thank you um leslie when you and the excess stuff paper that you looked at was cancer death not increased in terms of excess death in that in that literature it was not which is interesting because we all thought it might be because of the delay in screening but i'm wondering if it's something where it's going to hit in a year or two we're going to be seeing a lot of advanced cancers because that's going to take i think a little bit more time to show up than say heart disease which will show up more rapidly yeah great thank you and um could you comment um dan saltman wanted to just someone to comment about the role of obesity and the more severe infection either one of you or both of you i mean it's definitely quite elevated for um people who are overweight especially once you get over a bmi i think of 35 it goes up fairly dramatically nestor do you have another comment any comment yeah i i maybe a century ago i read a paper on obesity and coping and and it basically mentioned that because of the amount of fat cells in the body there's more inflammatory mediators so supposedly fat tissue it's a important producers of of inflammatory cytokines etc so the the and this is the same pathophysiology of some of the some of the diseases that are associated with obesity so they thought that that cytokine storm is it's uh it's more more uh dramatic and people who are overweight or or obese um there's also some mechanical issues when when you're hypoxemic if you already have like a decreases quotient of the diaphragm etc also that you know sort of simpler mechanical explanation for the issues with obesity but i think we don't we don't know the whole the whole story but that those were like the the points that the paper made about how how to explain obesity with with um with that and obviously there's also the the relationship with diabetes and insulin resistance and other metabolic consequences of obesity that may or may not be associated with a more severe copy but i thought it was it was interesting um you know at least the the theoretical explanations of why an obese person will have a more severe uh viral infection which which is sort of unique in that sense thank you um jeff miller has a couple of questions just about reinfection um is what is the latest information on how protective a previous history of copenhagen illnesses from getting sick with it a second time that's the first part of the question i've seen eighty percent effective so nestor anything yeah can can you repeat the question again i was looking for the librarian put the article that i found he put it right away now how how protect is there any what's the latest information on how protective a previous history of copa 19 is from getting sick a second yeah well leslie said it's around 80 percent it has been looking the healthcare workers in the siren study and a couple of other large studies with healthcare workers which are you know easy to study because they are like close to the researchers and they have found that yeah if you have copied you at least have 80 percent protection and they they're now talking about six to eight months is the the length of study that they have been able to to validate or the length of protection so far and it's probably longer than that but but at least six to eight months uh 80 percent okay great and then um the the second part of the question is if um what is the impact on getting seriously ill a second time do people get this are they more likely to get more seriously ill the second time or less likely i i mean i've seen case reports of more severe disease especially at the beginning of the pandemic when i was counting their infection publications there were some reinfections that were more severe they were older milder um but i i don't know what like the latest uh assessment of that now that we have much more data on that i can tell you that that for instance what's happening in brazil with this later searching cases is that at least these second cases with the p1 variant seems to be with higher mortality case fatality rate doubles or triples if you compare with the first wave and some of those cases are are second infections uh because are people who were infected in the first so i think it depends on on factors like like your age how far away was your first infection i mean if it was march or april and now you're getting another one a year later it may not be a big difference in severity so so i think there are several factors and also that if you're infected with a more pathogenic uh variant like b117 or p1 uh you're probably going to have a more severe disease than the first time around so but that's a good question i don't really know like a single answer for that thank you thank you nestor i just wanted to let everybody know that the um cme link went into the chat about 12 44. if you want to see me for this please fill that out and we would love to hear your feedback and i'm going to turn it over to joanna for the remainder of the questions thanks carla um uh laura tomati do you want to unmute and ask your question about um school-age kids it's a really good one at the very end yeah i think especially with uh i sent my daughter back to school today in person i was just wondering if you guys had any thoughts on you know there's been some kind of more casual reporting about increases in uh covet especially variants like the uk variant and school aged children and then that may be driving some of the spikes they're seeing in michigan for example and just wondering if you had what you found on that and you know if there's anything sort of us in new mexico should prepare for yeah i summarize what i have seen and heard some of these are just coming from from some experts in podcasts that i follow they have anecdotically reported an increase in the severity of the mis of the multi-inflammatory syndrome and and in children but i haven't really seen any any publication to that regard um we know from data from the uk that there was a increase in the percentage of children affected with the uk variant so so because that one is the one becoming more prevalent in the us i wouldn't be surprised if if we see more cases in younger population the same phenomenon has been observed in brazil there's an increase in the number of cases among young younger patients and even more severe disease i think i mentioned last week a paper in which they saw in the group 20 to 29 at triple of the case fatality rate uh and the rest of the group was the double case double the case fatality rate so there's definitely um you know more death and more hospitalizations and severe disease in younger age group although it's it's still a small percentage we're talking from you know point zero six to point thirteen that's double uh the case for that is this is still less than one percent fatality rate but it's a doubling of the fatality rate but i have seen and heard this um sort of shifting of the disease to our younger population i think we need to be on the look for that um you know in our data and there's also an effect on vaccination we have vaccinated a sizeable percentage of our you know over 75 over 60 so probably just by uh the natural effect of the protection of the vaccine most of the cases are going to now be seen in the you know less than 60 less than 50 years of age which are lagging behind vaccination in some states thank you laura for the great question thank you nestor um dr anjali from unm um says she's heard that new mexico will be a sight for the the younger kids trials and just we don't have marla on but want to know if anyone if you've heard about that nestor or leslie or anybody else and does anyone know how to sign up for those if that's the case um maybe we can ask marla next week if she's heard i i don't know really i haven't heard here okay great no no problem um uh and then uh dr colemeyer i think from uh state of washington says it's any update on nestor on the presentation you gave last week about the um adt the androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor blockers um any update on that that you've kind of read in the literature no nothing so far we're waiting for the publication of the what we saw in the european news outlet about the 92 percent recovery rate et cetera um and i i really want to to be cautious because we have i remember the excitement with the kochi scene and and you know and the hydroxychloroquine so i think we need to be a little bit now we're mature we've been through a year of of uh hopeful news and that they do not really uh so we'll have to wait and see what the publication where the limitations of the vapors are but just to recap they they mentioned this was a double-blind placebo control story with prosalutamide which is a androgen receptor inhibitor that is presumably used for from metastatic prostate cancer and they found a very dramatic uh percentage of recovery very short recovery decreased mortalities all of the endpoints were very favorable uh to the prosolutomate compared with the placebo almost too good to be true i mean it was like if i remember like three percent mortality versus 47 percent in the placebo group so it was like a 92 reduction in mortality uh but we have to see we have to see wait and see um the actual paper uh to make sure that there was not like a bias or some other treatment together with that maybe they gave him dexamethasone or some other treatment on one of the arms and that produce some type of bias in the story so we have to be careful but yeah we're waiting for the for that proxolutamide and also the flu box i mean the other the ocd medication that it has it was like miraculously miraculous results in the source trial we need to wait for the large trial to to see the results there was a study in chest infections a couple weeks ago on progesterone in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone and the treatment of men hospitalized with moderate to severe cobit and they actually had 42 patients randomized and definitely not as good as the drug that nestor was saying which i'm not going to be able to pronounce but patients treated with progesterone required three fewer days of supplemental oxygen were hospitalized for two and a half fewer days so interesting really interesting uh maybe it has something to do with the male predominance too um well we have a minute left um john foster lets us know and thank you for that john that um there is a moderna youth trial six months and up going on in phoenix arizona um and kent knows where they are digital librarians said unm researchers to join national trial of moderna vaccine and children so okay thank you for that ken very much he sent a link and i just wanted everybody to know that there's a few more echoes going on this week at project echo our first responder resiliency echo has a talk today it's called building resilience and first responders uh it's a two-part series it's uh the speakers are very well known uh the speaker today is brigadier general steve zanakis um and he'll be presenting this week at 2 p.m mountain time as well as next week we have the last of our climate change series on wednesday at 10 p.m with a very well-known uh national climate change communicator ed maybach from george mason uni university we have our mental health and resiliency echo with the ihs on thursday at noon as well and carla i wanted to turn it back to you to see if you have any other questions and yes there is the mental health resilience section is today at 2pm mountain time yeah and um we have critical care but not this week it's the 15th of april so that's the next critical care session 8 o'clock on the 15th thank you for that carla and yeah the the cme went in and we'd love to get your feedback thank you so much and we'll see you next week thank you nestor and leslie thanks everybody\"\n",

      "Text: \"hi everybody can you hear me great okay i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm welcome everybody to our infectious disease office hours it is may 10th uh 12 noon mountain time and uh welcome uh to this uh weekly session with dr nestor sosa dr leslie hayes and the rest of our team i wanted to remind you to keep your um to keep your line muted and turn your camera on if you have that opportunity it's perfectly all right to eat and drink for many of you it's your lunch hour uh please be reminded that kent knows worthy our digital librarian will be putting in evidence-based evidence-guided material into the chat and i think you will enjoy getting that material and then 45 minutes after the hour you can get the cme link and even if you don't need cme please fill that out we do i'll look at that at least once a month and see how you are all doing and see how we can improve these sessions so without further ado going to turn it over to our leader dr nester sosa who is a professor in the department of internal medicine the infectious disease lead and he's our great champion here and he has a presentation followed by dr leslie hayes thank you thank you very much joanna so yes i'm amnestos i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm let me share the screen putting on presentation mode okay so yes i um today i'm going to review several uh articles uh some of them are somewhat extensive so i'm going to be quick um the this photo i just want to make references for i found in one of the articles the the uh pink dots here are the the coronavirus and this is like the surface of a cell so so you have an idea how many how many viruses are you know trying to enter or touching on the in this on this cell i thought it was a nice a nice photograph so start with some good news before i give you some bad news essentially this is the graph that i actually got from dr shan update that she does here at unm on the on the kobe's hospitalization in the u.s and you can see obviously that there's a significant decrease if you compare with like november december where we were in hospitalization and where we are and and i'm showing this because i just read an article on mnwr on the forecast for the next few months and it was somewhat for me somewhat disappointed and i'm going to go through that the article is actually this is the name of the paper uh modeling of future copy 19 cases hospitalization and death um according to vaccination rates and and npi the non-pharmacolog pharmaceutical intervention um and actually what the cdc did they actually invited six different modeling teams from you know throughout the united states they gave them some general guide guidance on how to how to uh create some some potential scenarios and then these six modeling teams actually um did a prediction on what's going to happen with the cases hospitalizations and and death from kobe 19 in the next few months here in the us and these are some of the assumptions they actually have like a four four scenario they they put high vaccination or low vaccination and then moderate mpi or non pharmaceutical interventions and low so they have four possible uh situations high high low low or high low low highs so as you may imagine and these are the definitions of what they consider a high vaccination or a high mpi um estimation and what i found surprising were the results in all of this exercise they actually uh calculated the four scenarios and you can see here uh the low low low vaccination low mpi is obviously the the the solid line and and then low vaccination moderate and in all cases they predicted um sort of a search in the in late may early june despite the you know the effort to vaccinate people even the most optimistic scenario which is the the the one with the the line and the dot here uh still there's a there's a minimal increase number of cases obviously if no intervention is done there are more cases which could could be a you know close to 40 50 cases per week uh in the in the beginning of june uh but the good news if you're if you're an optimist is that that even in the worst scenario the cases are going to go down um right before the fall so so but but obviously this this study underlines the importance of continuing some type of non-uh pharmacological intervention as we move forward with the vaccination effort and how important it is to to try to convince people to get vaccinated because in in several these scenarios we're going to have a surge small surge in the number of hospitalization and cases and these are the number of death also with the same shape and this is really consistent uh among all the all the different uh modeling groups that did this exercise so i think that's that's the the message of these of this interesting publication there are some other leaders but i i wanted to highlight that that we we certainly need to to continue the effort in getting people vaccinated and getting some type of of mpis until we're really out of the woods or completely out of the pandemic the other the other article that i want to mention uh it's about a new vaccine i think several months ago i actually presented some data on the novavax vaccine and we haven't really talked about it a lot because you know although the headline has been um uh all of the pfizer moderna and astrosenic and johnson and you're gonna have like like uh uh get all the got all the attention from from the publication but i think nova box is another vaccine and just to just as a refresher this uh this is a recombinant protein vaccine that actually uses the the the spike protein and and the way they make it it's really interesting they use cell from from uh from an insect and they infected with a vacuum of virus which is a pathogen of of insects and they including the vacuum virus the gene to synthetize the profusion uh conformation of the s protein so basically the plant i'm sorry that the cells start producing this this s protein um which is the the surface protein from the from the uh sarsko ii and then this this because it's just a protein they usually combine it with a plant-based a saponin-based matrix m and i i think i presented this paper but the way they look under the microscope the the spike protein arranged and solves in this rosette this nice looking almost like a small flower and this is the the sapling uh matrix so it's a it's a it's a different uh sort of a cage and and this is the way that the the this vaccine is formulated with this adjuvant and then the rosettes of spike protein and that's what what administers so the story was actually published in the new england journal and it's the they actually publish the data of the nova box vaccine in south africa against the south african variant the the b1351 and what's interesting well they enrolled mostly young young patients um so they were like 4 000 patients in in this study 2000 in every group in the vaccine group and placebo group and they use one dose of the of the of the nova box vaccine in this relatively young population and the main the the the main finding was actually the efficacy was around 50 percent so and this is against again most of this patient had the the south african uh variance so so this is comparable um to some of the other studies with these uh with these uh with this variant which is one of the most troublesome and they actually divided patients uh because as you know in south africa there's a very high prevalence of hiv so they divided the the cohort among hiv positive and hiv negative and amongst among those who are hiv negative because it was around 60 so slightly slightly better than than the general 50 efficacy because that included some uh hiv patients and these are the graph basically the placebo and the vaccine we have we are now used to seeing this graph it was better obviously in those hiv negative it was more more of a separation between the cases in the in the placebo will keep going up as opposed to the know about vaccine which the cases are kind of flat but one of the most interesting finding of this study was what happened in the placebo group and is that those who receive a placebo if they had covered or did not have copied they have the same incidence of copy 19 which that means that that if you had copy before with this variant there's no protection you know so so that it was really surprising and interesting that that you had the same risk of developing covet if you were not vaccinated this is like the natural history of the disease people exposed to these new variants were as likely to get copied again as those who had copied already so so this basically in this well-def designed study to prove the efficacy of the vaccine they found this you know sort of uh serendipitous finding that that actually you have no protection and this is this is basically the timeline of the of the different variants in in south africa and you can see the square here or the rectangle is where they did the story most of the most of the cases were obviously uh due to the to the variant to the to the 501 v2 variant which is the the south african also known as the 351 so but this finding was kind of impressive that there's no protection against this this 351 even if you had kobe so if you were in the placebo same incident which was interesting um the other uh vaccine story that i want to share with you and this is something that we have asked do immunocompromised patients develop vaccines develop antibodies after vaccination are they protected and we are already starting to get data on these published data and this is a this is a publication from john hopkins in which they measure the antibody production in patients who had received solid organ uh transplants before so included liver kidney lung etc um this was the publication is a research letter um and and uh from from from from john hawkins and what they found uh and let me go let me uh take you through the to this table they basically notice that there were three types of patient patients who did not respond at all to the two doses of the vaccine those one negative those two negatives so no antibody response those who actually responded to the second dose but not to the first and those who responded to both so if you want to just simplify like around 54 of these patients had a good antibody response 46 did not so so obviously this is much less response as compared to immunocompetent patients where the responses are 99 98 percent almost everybody mounts a good antibody response and then the efficacy we know in clinical trials is around 94 to 95 and this is mrna vaccines um so that was the first phenomenon so obviously these solid organ transplant patients that are taking immunosuppressive um they they just just barely half of them a little bit more than half of them actually react to the to the vaccine and some of them have no reaction to the first law so a large percentage have no reaction but finally with the second dose they got a better a better response obviously there is sort of a an age related relationship the older you are the less likely you are to response it's it's always this way so almost 50 percent of those um over 60 had no no response so so a little bit less than that than the whole group the group as a whole there was no significant difference in the gender response and other factors was the the type of of organ um the the worst uh response was probably long with with 61 having no no immunity or no antibody production um obviously the pancreas is it was very small the number eighty percent but there were only four patients but definitely if you have lung compared to let's say liver or kidney that had a better a better uh response overall and also the the and this is something that we know from from infectious disease and and from transplant medicine that the longer you are from your transplant the better you are so you you see like those who were less than three years had a 63 non-response as opposed to those who were more than 12 years had only a 33 non-response so obviously if you if you if your patient is recently transplanted and was vaccinated he's more susceptible uh to have kobe because the lack of of response of the antibody so so i i really like this trial it was uh you know around 658 transplant subject it was not thousands of subjects but it starts to tell some story about it and there was also a difference i'm sorry i forgot to mention about the different if if the patient was on a mycophenolate or one of these anti-metabolites either mycophenolate or acetioprine um the response was much less than if it was only on prednisone and and cyclosporine so so there's also a difference of what they are receiving currently uh to the degree of of immune response to the to the vaccines to the mrna vaccines the other paper that i i'm just going to summarize in one table is the durability of a humeral immune response to to sars kobe 2 this is um it's going to be published in some reports and i just like the the graph of these the summary graph of this paper uh which was sort of a complicated immune paper and i'm not going to go through all the details but to make a long story short this is sort of the evaluation of the of the humeral immunity response to sarcobit ii um as measured by antibodies again the spike in patients who have the natural infection and and to make a long story short both the memory b cells and the igg anti-spike antibody last for at least six months what we lose relatively early are the igm as you might expect and the neutralization okay but at least there's evidence of sort of a long-lasting eight-month in this case 31 32 weeks um off of the antibody producing b cells and also some of the antibody cell uh cytotoxicity so these are probably the longest uh you know follow-up publications on on the the natural infection duration of immunity which is already around eight months according to these these authors and finally it's been a while since i have presented anything on therapy we have really concentrated on vaccine but i i thought it was important you remember the recovery trial was the one that gave us the dexamethasone recommendation is this this real life or close to real life trial that they're doing in in the uk with with thousands of patients uh randomized to different arms so now they finally published because i have seen this in pre-publication but they finally published the il-6 inhibitor toscillis map in hospitalized patient and actually um is the second drug that clearly demonstrates decreasing mortality together with the dexamethasone now we have the tosaliso map and and a high percentage of patients who are receiving um so i'm going to go through this uh trial so it was published in the lancet a few days ago to silicon map and patients admitted to the hospital would cover it so these were all sorts of you know patients with with um with copic diagnosis and you can see these are the the two groups so 63 uh years is the mean age so they were sort of the the high high group and in fact they had like almost one quarter of them were over 70 so this was definitely different from the from the vaccine study we saw from south africa and there were there was also significant ventilatory support so so more or less 50 of the patient with either a non-invasive ventilation or already on mechanical ventilation so these were patients with you know fairly um severe or advanced uh kobe uh infection or kobe 19 infection they ended up randomizing 2000 in each arm so conventional therapy versus for versus docile isumab and this is all the whole design the whole recovery if you remember was over twenty thousand patients and these are all the arms called xenonsation uh acetomycin etc but but this is just concentrating on the tosilizumab and to make a long story short they found a benefit modest but but a very um solid difference in in the mortality and also in the possibility or probability of being discharged our lives so so to to positive outcome and you can see the kaplan mayor um of being discharged alive always better with the with the tosylisimap group compared to the standard of care and then it was also consistent across all patients age gender racial or ethnicity uh if you were on ventilator support or not they were you know most of the most of these findings were to the left favoring the tosilisium up and obviously the the overall overall benefit was uh with with a risk ratio of point uh 85 so means 15 percent better uh uh probability of survival at 28 days with the silicon map and then numerically so it was 15 percent for 28 day mortality at 20 to 22 better chance of being discharged also there was less risk of renal failure and less risk of developing or going on to the need mechanical ventilation so pretty positive i mean not dramatic i mean we're not talking 80 decrease in mortality we're talking 15 to 20 percent decrease in all this risk factor but nevertheless something better than that we have seen with other drugs like hydroxychloroquine even rendezvous has not been able to prove decreased mortality overall so that that was a positive and this is sort of a summary of all the studies um now with the recovery added to all the studies of ilisumab we can see that the the this forest plot is to the left so there's some benefits i think uh people after they they have time to digest this recovery star story uh i think some of the maybe the the nih or the idsa will move toward a more recommendation of this tosilism up in the in the future that that's sort of my my guess especially for patients who are hospitalized with increasing inflammatory markers and finally just one graph uh um about about the the b117 before we we presented this data here at the office hours uh we said that the there was a fight between the b117 and the california strains now the most recent um data on on our on our uh on our or the strains or the variance of concern you can see that now the the light orange b117 it's almost 60 it has really um defeated the 429 one of the california strains and some of the older all the original uh strains so now this is the most common throughout the united states and it's also the case for new mexico according to the the group that is working uh on this information here in the in the in the department of health in unm and the national laboratories okay i think that was it thank you thanks thank you dr sosa so much um i wanted to quickly turn it over to dr leslie hayes our primary care and addiction specialist hi thank you um so dr sosa i think you need to convince the id folks to come up with a different name than either the b117 because those are too hard to remember but i agree that the place names are not correct so i think maybe name them like they do hurricanes name them after you know uh people or something but we need a different naming system for them so i agree so there were some questions last week about vaccine hesitancy so i'm going to talk today about how to address vaccine hesitancies so and just some general advice if you're trying to talk to patients about vaccine first off all of this works better if you have a positive relationship with the person you're trying to convince you know don't even bother with aunt muriel who thinks you're an idiot because of who you voted for president last year it's just not good focus on people you already have a good relationship with second is to try to really listen and you don't want to listen with the idea of refuting the argument or um but you really want to listen and attempt to understand their concerns and i must say that this one actually um when i was in college i was having a political argument with someone i don't even remember what it was about but i remember that person sat down and listened to me for about 15 minutes and then recited my argument back and then said you know i still don't think i agree with you and that persuaded me to their point of view better than anything they could have said um so if you really understand people's um concerns it really does go a long way to being able to talk to them about it um know the science and be prepared to discuss it but also use anecdotes people really like anecdotes and it's been shown that it actually helps to get people to um take things more seriously so have anecdotes both about cobit patients who've gotten really sick or developed long covered and also anecdotes about the vaccine and um motivational interviewing is really great in this scenario um i found this wonderful article about something called the case approach which i've never heard of before um it was published in minnesota medicine in the march and april issue and k stands for corroborate a is about me s is the science and e is explained and advised so basically um first off you do what we already talked about is the listing very carefully and then you frame a response that corroborates what they've said um it's you know sort of discussing what their concerns are and then you make an about me statement which is sort of how you feel about it how you approached it then as you talk about the science underlying the recommendation and um or explaining their concerns and then finally explain your advice to the patient and i'm going to give an example but i really encourage you to go read the articles because they've got about six different examples of how to use this and it was just so helpful so patient 2 feels like the vaccine was rushed i'm hearing this first off you sort of corroborate so it does seem like the vaccine came out very quickly compared to the usual time course for vaccines and then say about me so i say i i truly was a little bit worried about how quickly it came out um until i did some reading and then i talked about the science when i did the reading i discovered that they actually went through all the steps they usually do for vaccines they just did it a lot more efficiently than usual because of the urgency of the situation and then explain in advice as your doctor i feel the vaccine is safe and they've done adequate study when you get it um and like i said you might want to look at the article because it really was a very helpful article on explaining how to use these and then some specific arguments um that my covet physician group has come up with online that i thought were useful we don't know the long-term effects of the vaccine and while this is true vaccines rarely cause long-term effects and we do know that covid causes plenty of long-term effects including lung disease heart disease diabetes and neurological symptoms and people who talk about the death rate is low for younger people again talk about the long-term effects and then i find this the most puzzling art argument that people but i hear this from people a lot i have a lot of health problems i am afraid the vaccine will make them worse and so with these help to talk about the patients may feel bad for a few days but it's rare that the vaccine causes any long-term worsening of health problems and they are at significant risk of problems from cobalt if they get it because of their health problems and then this was another one i really liked i'm young and i'm unlikely to get sick from cobit what does it matter to me and people said they've had really good success talking with about as long as young people are getting coveted they will be passing it on to more vulnerable people and we're going to have to continue the restrictions the sooner we can get sufficient number of young people vaccinated the sooner we can begin to lift the restrictions and people are saying they've actually had pretty good response to that particular argument and then i was a little embarrassed this last week one of my um patients called and she said i don't know if i want to get this vaccine they said it's not fda approved and so i was able to sort of go through and explain to her why um you know i still felt it was safe but i realized i didn't fully know the difference between fda approval and emergency use authorization unfortunately i was reasonably close and this is from the fda website and emergency use authorization means that the they feel there's good enough data but there's not as much data as would be needed for fda approval but they do have to have enough data to say that the intervention is safe and affected for its intended use and that the product can be made according to federal quality standards and they carefully balance all the potential risks and benefits of the product so even though it's not quite as strong of data as needed for fda approval it's still pretty strong and then this was very very interesting this woman is heather simpson and she was a big anti-vaccine advocate in texas for a few years and she ended up deciding she wanted to get the copic shot and so this article was just about her and why she decided to get it and then um i think i've mentioned your local epidemiology she actually did an interview with her and it's well worth reading just to kind of understand sort of the anti-vaccine mindset and there are a few things i got out of this from uh reading what she had to say so heather simpson became an anti-vaxxer she was i think considering or had just gotten pregnant and wanted to learn a little bit more about um vaccines and she said she ended up watching a nine-hour documentary that she found on facebook and she said she was especially convinced when she found a half dozen anti-vaccine doctors and i believe the anti-vaccine or kind of math vaccine doctors are very very harmful because people really do pay attention to them and she said if you're at all prone to fear it was very hard not to be convinced by this documentary which really um you know went after the fear and so she said she posted a mildly anti-vaccine post on facebook and she received many friend requests from anti-vaccine advocates and she also said she got a lot of vitriol from pro-vaccine forces and she states to solidify her anti-vaxx resolve so you know think about it if you see an anti-vaxx post maybe not attack the person because that often can push them further into the other camp and she said eventually she got frustrated because people were just opposed to anything medical and she had needed something medical and she started looking at the other side and she actually pointed out there's a spectrum from vaccine hesitant to extreme anti-vaxx and she said you know sort of first is vaccine hesitant then people who are just scared but not necessarily going one way or the other ex-faxers are people who had vaccinated their kids and their kids afterwards developed something such as adhd or autism spectrum disorder and they didn't have a good explanation for it and so they just chose the vaccines then the people who are 100 natural don't want to do any supplements um like conspiracy theorists and then what she referred to as the lizard people who are sort of extreme um conspiracy theorists and she said for the people who are just scared often just getting them the facts and if you can get them the facts before they've really gone down the anti-vaxx rabbit hole it can be very helpful so these are the people who often will respond to facts and understanding how things work um for the x facts there's one thing she said and this is obviously not a short-term solution but we need to get alternate explanations besides the vaccine for why children are developing autism spectrum disorder or adhd or some of these other conditions because right now often we don't have a good explanation for why children develop these and so it's easy for people to latch onto vaccine 100 natural the people who won't touch any pharmaceuticals i must admit i haven't had great success with these although some of them i do find it interesting um you know won't take the vaccines but they will take antibiotics them for these conditions when they get them and so i will talk to them sort of about what i view as the risk antibiotics and why i would much i'd take 50 flu shots over an extra course of antibiotics and that can sometimes be helpful um like conspiracy theorists i have found that sometimes we'll respond to actual conspiracies on the other side and um one thing and i i don't remember where this was but the media literacy um uh group out of albuquerque several years ago had a video where they taught teens about cigarette advertising and sort of all of the um uh manipulation and everything that goes into cigarette ads and it made them very strong um anti-tobacco ad um advocates and so realizing that you know because initially that they kind of thought there was smoking but then they realized the conspiracy was actually from the tobacco companies and the extreme anti-vaxxers are probably not worth spending a lot of time on at this point because you're probably not going to make much of a difference there and then paid people and i was unable to find actually the original research um that this article from the new york times was based on but uh it was on based on data from the ucla covered 19 health and politics project and so they said if we give you 100 bucks but this make you more or less likely to get a vaccine and 34 said they would be more likely 15 actually said they'd be less likely because they were like oh if they're paying me there must be something wrong with it um so you increased it about 19 if you offered people money for it a little bit less if you offered them less money and then they also found that the possibility that you could go without a mask was an incentive but interestingly people who are unvaccinated often don't think they need a mask so if you looked at um the likelihood of people um getting the vaccine if they no longer had to wear a mask um versus still having to wear a mask it went up they divided it out by all these different groups it went up the most in republicans um more in white people than black people overall it people were 13 percent more likely to get the vaccine if they thought they could um stop wearing a mask but interestingly the number of people in the last two weeks who died at a restaurant who were not vaccinated was 53 fully vaccinated 32 percent of them dined at a restaurant um gathering outdoors with more than 10 um non-family members um again the non-vaccinated were more likely to do that so um they may not they need so to begin with so that may not be much of an incentive to get them vaccinated for a lot of people and then some interesting articles um uh evaluation and management of code 19 in pregnancy and contemporary ob gyn was just a good summary of all the literature on coping 19 in pregnancy and in my family my daughter got pfizer so she is refers to herself as team pfizer most of the rest of us got moderna and my son got johnson and johnson and we have all sorts of ridiculous arguments about who's the coolest because of which vaccine we got but this was a pretty funny article about why johnson johnson is the coolest and then this was a nice article by i believe she's either a pediatric infectious disease doctor or pediatric hospital so i can't remember which um on kids vaccines are on the way and why um uh parents should get that vaccine if you want to show it to any of the parents in your practice so and that was everything i have thank you dr hayes fantastic really good skills and communication points for us all about vaccine hesitancy and i wanted to introduce dr cecilia thompson cecilia are you are you there mrs one of the medical directors at tricor i am here i don't have anything to update today but i'm happy to take any questions regarding testing fantastic uh thank you cecilia and i think uh we don't have marla sivers on on the call uh just yet today um but i'm gonna turn it over to dr thornton thank you joanna hi everyone carla thornton here with infectious diseases at unm um nice to see everybody so we have a bunch of questions i'm just going to start from the earlier ones um this can be for either of you uh dr ellen caro was asking will new mexico pursue pursue herd immunity as others give up on that goal any any thoughts about that so dr fauci actually had an interview on npr last week and he said no we're not giving up on herd immunity he said the problem is it's just hard to have that as your goal because we don't really know what the threshold is and he said our goal is still to vaccinate as many people as possible so it's not like they've given up it's just sort of they've changed the goal to just being let's just keep vaccinating and figure out how to get as many people as we can vaccinated thanks leslie nest or anything no i i mean for me it's like saving money to for my retirement i mean i'm not gonna say i'm gonna save a million dollar if i save a million and a half it's i'm happier if i say you know two million so i think it's it's you have to make the best effort to vaccinate as many people as possible you don't you're not going to stop at 65 or 70 or 75 just get everybody vaccinated and we get this over i mean the the the hair immunity is just a concept epidemiological concept but in reality the reality is that you try to vaccinate as many people and fight hesitancy etc i think that's that's the key not obsessed on a number thank you nester in reference to the the information you gave about the transplant patients leslie hayes was asking should we check antibody levels in patients with organ transplant after vaccine to document immunity sorry yeah i haven't really thought about it um if but if if anything it would be in that in that population if you if you if you're going to measure in somebody or in some group it would be immunosuppressed to see but we need to have a correlator protection which is i'm not sure we have a complete clear idea that what level of antibodies protection and which one is not it's it's a little bit more complicated i mean there have been efforts by research groups to try to find a correlate between neutralizing antibodies and and vaccine efficacy but it's hard you know when there's so many commercially available and maybe cecilia can make a comment on these two uh to say okay you have whatever 3.5 you know level of antibiotics protected or not it's kind of hard for me to to to find that magic number go ahead yeah and i'll just add that there are um diagnostic tests available to determine whether you have antibodies that are due to vaccine or due to natural immunity but nestor's right there's no cut off for whether this is a protective level of antibody or not those studies are still ongoing so they're not part of the diagnostic test thank you very much um john foster asked a really interesting and important question can you explain the mechanism of why vaccines appear to provide better protection than natural infection which doesn't seem to be the case for most other infectious diseases right i can try to speculate a little bit based on what i have read in the uh especially the discussions of the papers about immunity and is that the natural infection when you when you're dealing with the virus the virus does have like inhibitors of the immune system so the virus tries hard to fight your immune system and and uh they are like you know uh proteins in the in the virus especially the the open reading frame that that antagonize the interferon etc so you do not mount a perfect immune response as opposed to when you are vaccinated and then you have a booster again uh there is a more robust specific uh antibody with all the you know the anti immune system proteins that may be playing a factor when you are sick with covet so that's that's the best explanation that people can come up uh and and another reason for the for getting the the vaccine even if you have kobe you know you have to get a dose of the vaccine and then you mount a more robust immune system because the virus doesn't allow you to mount the ideal immune response because that's part of the mechanism in which he he um he's successful you know causing disease impairing your your ability to respond to it great thank you necessarily um i'm gonna see if julie brockmeyer if you can if you have audio can you admit yourself and ask your question yes my question was in regards to the recent um recommendations for how soon after getting being positive with covid you should get the vaccine i know that the cdc has said 90 days i know that i've also heard two weeks um i am talking about a a patient without comorbidities who was non-hospitalized but still has myalgias and three weeks out right that's that's a good question i don't think we have like a definitive answers and i've seen two schools those who who recommend vaccination as soon as possible in order not to miss an opportunity to vaccinate so if you have somebody who's under your care and hackability let's say a month ago you can probably vaccinate him right there if you think he's going to be lost a follow-up or you're not going to see him again because there's no there's no absolute contraindication for vaccination the idea of the three-month uh it's number one to because that person presumably during those first three months after kobe um it's somewhat protected from having a reinfection so there's no rush and if you want to use that dose on an unvaccinated people or person it's even better because you're using the dose more rationally when a person has zero protection versus somebody who maybe has an 80 percent protection from the natural infection so that's that's the other reason i recently actually last week i reviewed a paper in which for the first time they tried to see the immune response on those who had copied um uh in association with the time when they were vaccinated and there seems to be like a sweet spot after a month of having kobe you get a better response a better antibody response so if you get the vaccine too close to the acute infection you're you're not going to mount a a pretty good uh antibody level so there's there's some data now coming out that probably you have to wait a little bit at least a month but you can safely wait you know more than that because you're protected from a reinfection so from a sort of a epidemiological point of view you can wait up to the three months which is which is from some of the recommendations so but that's the data that we have and the second part to that was um i have heard and i don't know if this is anecdotal or not that sometimes getting the vaccine will cure those symptoms right there yeah that's that's another good question for people who would long call it uh there have been a few studies that are showing that after vaccination patients with long-coverage symptoms a percentage not all of them and it's not you know like super dramatic there is a percentage of them who actually improve and no and there's no evidence that they get worse so so the the you know it's not a hundred percent the paper that i review is more around around 25 percent of those who have done copy had an improvement in their symptoms obviously if you're one of those you're going to say oh i got much better than the vaccine but there's some other in the in the surveys that actually didn't improve dramatically after vaccination uh but there is at least the reassurance that that most of them got better or at least didn't didn't didn't get any worse thank you thank you julie for those great questions um nestor uh harry seibold had a question about it looked like on your slide uh in the tesla map study that the people that were older than 80 years of age did not have um benefit is that is that correct yeah i would have to go back to the paper i don't remember and i'm wondering if that is because of the small number of patients in that group i am i would have to review the slides let me go back here okay and well um yeah it was to the left just to answer it was to the left of the graph it's just that it crossed one the the confidence interval were basically crossing one but the but the the mean was to the left so it was beneficial but it was too broad of a confidence interval because of the number of subjects um in in that uh in that group great thank you so much um we have a question about the brazil variant any any um information about that necessary that you have no i i review i mean we will review here uh uh a couple of papers on the immune response and um there is a there is an immune response and they are neutralizing antibodies they are not affected the the neutralizing antibodies especially the mrna vaccines induce antibodies which are in between the the uk and the south africans so the brazilian in the in the antibody levels it's sort of in between the worst case scenario would be the south african which is the one that that you generate less um less of a neutralizing antibody the uk seems to be almost unaffected by by regarding neutralizing antibodies so the brazilian seems to be in between the two the south african and uh and the uk variant but that's that's the only thing i have seen obviously there is a concern on the ground in brazil because they're using um one of the chinese vaccine the corona back that is not very effective but this is just anecdotal i mean we don't have data on on efficacy specifically against the brazilian uh strain in in in clinical stories thank you um i wanted to see also if anne corley slain if you if you have audio if you can ask your question because it has a several different parts to it and if you can just introduce yourself sure my name's anne corliss lane i'm actually an infection preventionist nurse in michigan um so i've been doing a lot of studying with virology and just trying to learn about the whole process of the mutant virus and what i've been trying to research is if there's actually any clinical studies proving that those variants are more contagious or do they have a higher binding affinity with the ace receptors or is it just kind of coincidental because the rate counts are going higher you know if you have higher rates you're going to have more deaths people have been a little bit more lacks on the npis so is it just kind of a coincidental thing or are these mutant viruses actually more transmissible yeah that's a i want to take that one it's a great question uh and and this question has been sort of put uh it's in several you know different discussion forum well there's so many evidence the the fact that that the new variant like the uk variant basically overrun all of the other previous variants suggest that there's an advantage in transmission so that's sort of an epidemiological thing if you have two variants competing for the same population and you see one becoming more and more common one of the likely explanation is that it's more transmissible so there's sort of a an indirect conclusion there's also evidence of a higher viral load uh in patients with these new variants when they compare the ct values of some of the patients with the old variants with the wuhan the original and those with with this mutation including the the 614 and and the the really variance of concern that the like the brazilian and the uk variants they seem to be more transmissible and they seem to have a higher vital load and they're trying to find explanations it's a little bit more difficult to find why that is happening uh they think that their the changes in the spike protein produces more con conformational changes in the spike and makes it more available for the receptors but i think that's that's a little bit more complicated to understand but there is both epidemiological clinical and also some basic science um uh sort of explanations to to understand what there's more transmissibility regarding severity at the beginning the the people the groups in the uk actually published that the uk environment seemed to be more severe but there have been two publications recently which basically have put that in doubt they they actually compare uh patients with and without the uk variant and they couldn't find um really you know measures of severity uh when they look at a more specific hospitalized population with both uh with either the uk or some of the original variants so i think transmissibility is accepted as a that it occurs and and um severity we're still um not sure that it's more severe that any of these variants are are really more severe what the brazilians are saying is that it's affecting younger population but we don't really know if it's a if it's sort of a consequence of vaccination of all the groups they're still looking into that into that data great thank you so much great thank you so much that's super helpful i'm gonna go ahead and just turn it back over to joanna further questions great thank you carla so much um thank you guys for all these amazing questions today too and for the hub team for providing all these uh um kind of evidence-based and evidence-guided answers there's a a question from dr yehuda pat about the indian indian variant and how the vaccine might affects that might affect that nestor and then i think dr mertz um has a question about a physician from rutgers who died over in india um uh who had been fully vaccinated in the u.s and wanted to see if you could address that um as well right i haven't really seen any papers uh on correlation with the so-called indian marian which is the b1 617 i wrote it down here because there's so many numbers i'm even i'm going crazy with all these numbers so the 617 which is the so-called indian baron has the e uh 4a4 mutation which is one of those mutant uh you know mutations associated with immune escape uh but i haven't really seen any graph comparing you know level and neutralizing antibodies with the so-called indian uh i think it's a it's a bit too soon we'll probably see it in the next few weeks and i've been waiting for the pre-publications but i haven't really seen it maybe out there but but i don't i do not really know uh how the best is and i heard about this uh physician who was fully vaccinated i think he was in the 80s so that he was 80 years old so that may be a factor and there's definitely breakthrough infections even without variance there could be breakthrough infections we know that there have been a few uh thousands of breakthrough infections in the in the united states so it's it's possible um but it's also possible that he was infected with the variant that was not uh adequately controlled by the immune response to the original vaccine i saw something online about him and it did say that um although he had covered he was never severely ill and so the vaccine did seem to protect him from severe illness he had underlying heart disease and in all likelihood the code precipitated the heart attack but he did not die from the severe cobalt he died from his underlying condition that was brought out by it so the vaccine does seem like it at least in part did what it was supposed to do thank you thank you nestor thank you leslie um maria christina garcia has a question about the vaccines against the p2 variant from from brazil and i think you've mentioned credit you mentioned um we've kind of discussed this already so i might go on to um excuse me excuse me um and then i and deborah hill mentioned um deborah hill also uh questions about should um uh guidance about people who um we have received guidance that those who are fully vaccinated two weeks out to three months out would not be considered a close oh deborah do you want to maybe an un unmute and ask your question um i thought it was a different type of question but i don't think we've addressed this no yeah sure thank you um so we've been given guidance as school nurses and others that um folks who have been fully vaccinated which means two weeks out have three months where they are not considered a close contact but we have so many people now who are beyond the three months and i've been looking around and i'm trying to figure out what is the guidance that we give um to folks who are over the three-month mark are they still considered no need to quarantine not close contact do we have any any word on extension of that time that's that's what does that make sense yeah that's a great question i don't think we have the answer yet i think this the cdc is waiting for more data on the durability of the protection we saw some data from the phase two of moderna that at least went out to four months but we haven't really seen anything beyond because people have been vaccinated just you know the last three three or four months but you're right there are people who were vaccinated late december early january and and uh except for those who participate in clinical trials the real life vaccination started in january in most places so so yeah we're five months out we need we need new guidance on this how long the protection is gonna last uh i have heard about the so-called booster that we need a booster at some point maybe at the six-month point or something but we still need more data and i think the cdc is like scrambling to find more evidence of how long the protection really lasts to to be able to extend their their recommendations on on when a person is fully vaccinated if you're five or six months out are you still fully protected or not that's that's a great question uh thank you for that great question uh deborah um kim joy has a question um nester and leslie about a patient that she had that had this significant amount of swelling on her face and arm and hand after the first vaccine um and uh anyway kim read that if if the patient were to take an ace inhibitor that it might prevent any swelling and wondered if you heard any read anything about this being evidence-based or evidence guided no i have not i have not interesting comment but i have not leslie any i haven't heard anything either okay okay thank you um and then this maybe is for cecilia um thompson do all labs have assays available to tech all the current variants it's a question from young young key markham so here i can answer for tri-core here at tri-core we are able to detect all of the major variants that are circulating in the u.s we're in constant contact with our tests and assay manufacturers to determine that that being said i don't know about every lab having that same communication but i would hope that they are doing the same as we as we are thank you cecilia just wanted to remind everyone that about 247 the cme link went into the chat as well um aline gush do you want to unmute and ask your a question a mini kind of mini case okay sure thank you um so this gentleman is 64 years old and he didn't have any underlying skin problems that we know of he hasn't had a rash in past he has a very widespread rash that is covering most of his body and it's the worst on his chest and upper back it's somewhat rough and pebbly textured there's been some weeping at times and he was given a course of oral prednisone [Music] a couple months ago and it was three days and it wasn't tapered um over the days and he became quite ill after that um after that the rash came back uh he said that he was given another course of prednisone but then they tapered it much more gradually but he was still somewhat ill so that that's right of course we don't really have that to offer him um i just started treating him with acupuncture and we had some improvement so far i'll be seeing him again today um but i i hadn't heard of anyone having a rash that lasted like this and was so widespread and it's been very itchy and and i had a lot of heat the entire time so i wondered if people have seen that and this is after after vaccination i'm sorry after vaccination the rash oh i'm sorry it was after his second shot of the moderna um the first shot was uneventful so he had the second one on february 19th and he still has the severe rash just as severe yeah no i haven't seen and and actually we i review a paper here a few weeks ago about the 12 cases of like rash associated with the with the mrna vaccines but they were really mild they were like localized in the elbows or around the area of injection for a few days after vaccination but i don't remember seeing this or he you know hearing at the description of a such a severe rush i don't know if you know maybe some of the primary care uh provider because i'm an infectious disease so i usually don't see the patient um in the communities but maybe somebody else have seen this more leslie thanks nestor let's see have you seen anything like this i have not elena actually sent me a picture of the ration it was a very impressive rash um of course we don't know 100 of us due to the vaccine you know uh although certainly timing wise it would make sense one thing i did recommend was at least um uh it's worth sending it into the american academy of dermatology as a registry for um post-vaccine rashes that they're sort of and i talked about it i think last week or the week before and it's worth sending it into that another thing is leslie we have a dermatology echo too on fridays at noon here and if you're in new mexico that might be something to consider as they they might see some dermatology um you know sequelae of the the vaccinations that's the possibility um maybe i could ask holly um who's our program coordinator to maybe send send you the link that would be great right um maybe we have time for uh kind of one more question if that's okay cynthia settles um has a really great question um and might just ask kind of everybody in our virtual room she says as we open up more what are other offices doing to see patients i'm a private pediatrician we have hepa filters in our rooms we currently see patients with coping symptoms in their car the whole office is vaccinated and my concerns are for the parents and kids coming in um coming in after and just kind of want to get a gestalt about kind of what you guys are doing are more and more of you seeing uh your ambulatory practice are you opening up your inventory practices um i know we don't do this but might you just chat in if you're you know if you're opening up just type in yes if you're not uh say no um i'll comment that we're seeing about half a third we'll say a third of our patients in clinic at this point um and about two-thirds are still telehealth um we're doing pretty much the same things we have we have had since the pandemic started we have someone screening at the front door and it's amazing how many people don't think the coffin fever actually apply to them and you know get back in the room and they're like oh well yeah it's just my usual allergies it's like ugh but um the hepa filters and we are very picky about the masks everyone has to wear a procedure mask if they come in with a cloth mask they're um and we have uh distancing and have um but it's still it is a little scary so most people thanks leslie most people are saying that they are seeing patients more and more in person right now um some are saying that they're just uh um seeing patients uh lean says that they're still being quite conservative so um my my sense is it's probably going to be opening up uh more and more and thanks holly holly lovely um just sent the dermatology echo tele teller registration so fantastic thanks holly um thanks leslie for that um just wanted to let you know we'll hold on to the the questions we didn't get to we have about a minute left we do have a few more echoes that i wanted to tell you about before the end of the call today we have a first responder echo at 2 p.m mountain time 4 pm eastern time it's with jennifer weiss she runs serenity mesa rehab center for patients in recovery from substance all substance use disorder she's a fantastic speaker she's going to talk about resiliency related to substance use disorder which you know has gone up about 20 in the united states since the copic pandemic hit um on this uh thursday we have the um indian health service mental health and resiliency although it is open to everybody and carla do we have the um critical care echo this thursday or is it is it next thursday yeah thanks joanna it's next thursday may 20th and it's on covid19 and children fantastic so that that'll be a great talk i wanted to thank dr sosa i want to thank dr hayes dr thompson and of course dr thornton and uh and primarily all of you guys for coming on to this call every week and we'll see you next week thank you\"\n",

available because we love to to see people's faces and we like to build communities so we're very happy to to have you today again um we will be um using the chat box for questions only uh if you have a question for the hub team please put the the question in the chat box we would ask you to refrain from actually answering questions in the chat box unless you're one of the hub team members um the other thing that's gonna you'll see in the chat are um uh references and and resources that are put in there by our digital librarian uh about things that come up we got quite a few questions beforehand in the registration so we'll try to answer those but if again if you have a question during this session please uh please let us know about that so i'm going to go ahead and introduce myself i'm carla thornton i'm an infectious disease physician here at unm one of the associate directors at project echo and i'll be co-facilitating this session with my colleague joanna katzman joanna do you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody joanna katzman i work with carla project deco and i'm glad to help carla and mr sosaud and and marla sivers and leslie hayes thanks carla thank you so we'll do introductions of the other hub team members uh in a minute but i'm going to go ahead and turn it over to dr nester sosa who's our chief of infectious diseases here at unm who has some updates to share with us and then we'll uh move into the questions after that an introduction of our other hub thank you nestor hi thank you carla and joanna welcome everybody and thank you for joining let me share my screen here for the update can you all see the slides okay yes we could see them okay thank you okay so the first uh few articles that i want to highlight uh have to do with the immunity we have a lot of questions about the immunity of this virus and i think um two of the papers that i'm gonna refer to actually shed some light on some of these issues with the immunity we have been showing some papers about the duration of antibody that was another small publication but well uh well done publication on on the duration of of kobe 19 antibodies there's also a question as you know you know a significant percentage of patients um who get corbin 19 produce antibodies and some of these antibodies are the so-called neutralizing antibodies that in vitro inhibit the capacity of the virus to infect cells but the question is do those neutralizing antibodies that we measure in the laboratory are they really protective there was a small um actually story from uh from an outbreak in a fishing vessel who actually sits online on that and then there was some some confusion on the on the media about an announcement of cdc that i want to highlight and clarify so those those are some of the initial articles so this is the the paper the paper is called dynamics of neutralizing antibody fighters and essentially they measure the antibodies on 34 patients five a hospitalized patient with severe copy 22 not hospitalized and seven asymptomatic patients and you can see in this graph that uh and this is sort of the the the fall change in the in the antibody how they go down with time so after 90 days since uh symptom onset the patient had essentially one quarter of the levels of neutralizing antibody that they had um initially on the first determination 30 days after symptom onset and if you um stratify them by symptoms yellow being the symptomatic hospitalized patient have higher levels of antibody but then as you can see as the day go by the the levels tend to go go down and the same occurs with the other patients with the non-hospitalized and with the asymptomatic um but to a less degree so it's interesting that more papers are actually pointing out to the reality that probably the antibodies at least the measurable antibodies are not going to last too long with these with this um virus the other interesting paper was an outbreak uh that occur in a in a shipping sorry fishing vessel that left a seattle in the midst of the of the pandemic there were 122 persons in that in that on board and of those 104 tested positive either by pcr or cerro converted by antibodies so an 85.2 percent uh attack rate extremely high even higher than the georgia outbreak in the the summer camp in georgia that was around 75 i remember correctly so this was even higher attack rate which highlights the the transmissibility of this virus in close um spaces like like the the inside of a of a boat or a ship and and but the interesting thing is that there were three uh sailors here in this uh study that had neutralizing antibodies when they got on board because they measure um the rtpcr and also measure antibodies on these subjects before and after and those three subjects that did not that did have neutralizing antibodies did not get infected so despite the fact that a lot of their coworkers got infected they were protected and when you use you know a simple four by four four table and do an analysis of the infected with neutralizing antibodies uh non-infected without neutralizing antibodies the this finding was a statistically significant although obviously we're only talking about about three subjects we neutralize an antibody but it's interesting that is the first time that the presence of neutralizing antibodies actually correlates with uh with protection obviously we'll see much more of this when we use uh when we do the vaccine studies with other with other uh studies but it's interesting that is the first um at least that i am aware of the first publication of actually showing the protection of neutralizing antibodies from infection in a very uh in a high high attack rate situation the other the other issue was more of a confusion from the from the media i i think it was thursday yeah thursday or friday that i saw in several of the of the media outlet both on tv and and social media and written press they were saying the cdc had um uh suggested that patients who have covered have protection for three months they were immune for three months um and and that was in several of the new channels i was surprised because i i didn't i read the the guidance of cc and i didn't read the same message and in fact the following day on friday august 14 actually the cdc came up with a media statement clarifying that and they said contrary to media reporting this science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection so there was sort of a confusion in the message and what they what they were saying is that if you have copied you don't need to repeat uh the pcr test at least for three months because you know it's going to be intermittently positive that we have discussed previously but that doesn't mean that the person is completely immune because there's no no data to that regard uh so far except for the the the data that i just mentioned about the neutralizing antibody on that uh small group of of sailors or fe or fishermen okay the other the other interesting question i have you know we we have discussed this in our in our um in in these meetings why do children have less severe disease and there are many hypotheses if you remember that there's speculation that because children receive a live virus vaccination they they have like an indirect or or sort of of a cross-reactive protection somehow but i found actually i we had a lecture on on pediatric coping in one of the sessions that i attended and i saw an article which i thought it was interesting it was an article it was actually published in may but i had missed it uh in which they measured the expression of ace a two of the receptor of the coronavirus in the nasal mucosa of of of people and they and in different age groups and they found that the kids actually the kids less than 10 years had a much lower expression of h2 in their mucosa so that's sort of a clue is the first like you know at least possible explanation for for the difference in the in the in the disease severity obviously there's much more to learn about this but it's interesting to see that that um at least in this study the kids with less than 10 years had a lower expression of the receptor for the virus in their nasal mucosa compared with young young people's 10 to 17 18 to 24 and more than 25 uh so that was i thought it was interesting although it's not a new article but it highlights these uh possible explanations for the difference and there were a couple of papers uh actually one of the papers was actually cited by the governor by uh by by our governor here about mask so there was a study published in jama in which they actually compare um the filtration capacity of the filtration efficiency of 895 respirators surgical mice masks with ties or straps and and procedure mask with ear loops and you can actually see that the filtration capacity obviously and this is expected was much better with the n95 and they included in this in this analysis even expired in 95 the 95 that had 11 years of uh have expired 11 years before so it was interesting that they they um still were able to feel to filter most of the particles measuring these and this study um obviously surgical mats with ties were better 71.5 percent filtration compared with the wars which are these a procedure mask that only filtrate 30.1 percent uh so it was interesting and they did this story with a with a man and a woman and different sizes of respirators it was an interesting story for those interested but definitely n95 confer a highest degree of filtration as we know um if you compare with the others but it was interesting to find that there was a difference between the surgical mask and the procedure mask in the filtration capacity really really interesting the other and this is the paper that was cited by by actually by the by the governor in one of the press conference was a relatively easy compar i mean cheap and inexpensive way to compare the efficacy of the filtering um of different masks especially cloth masks and and bandanas and other that the general public are are uh using so this this uh investigator from duke university actually devised a very simple um [Music] process and how to measure the filtration capacity they had a cell phone that they took up a video of of the of the what was happening they used a laser a simple green light uh laser uh and then they they had the subject stopped with the mask on and then they measured the number of particles that that were that were going through the mask and and they tested different types of mask from from the a95 the surgical or procedure mask to different types of cloth masks including fleas and bandanas and to make a long story short obviously the best filtering um the the the draws for the n95 and the surgical maps they were very effective retaining our our uh our drops when we talked um but and and some of the some of the cloth masks like the one made with polyester and cotton was also very effective but the least effective were obviously the bandanas and even the fleece was higher than not using a mask that was some somewhat surprising and apparently it's because the the fleece or very thin layers of cloth actually they they break the the drop the drops and and they can actually be more uh in the in the camera than than than without the mask so definitely you know what type of mask you use may make a difference so those made with combined fabrics or several layers or surgical masks are better than anything like bandanas or fleece uh at the moment of retaining our own uh secretions that was that was an interesting it was published in science advanced and then an update on on convalescent plasma here at the university of new mexico we published our study uh that we did with convalescent plasma we actually enrolled uh 12 patients at the end because one third we enrolled 13 but one we drew consent and we we treated this patient with a convalescent plasma and we measure the neutralizing antibodies before and after transfusion and we also measure neutralizing antibodies in the donor plasma and what we found was somewhat disappoint disappointing we found that there was no uh not a significant increase in neutralizing titus after transfusion in the recipients so in fact 9 out of 12 so the majority of subjects that were transfused didn't have an increase in the neutralizing antibodies on the day after the transfusion so so we were probably not selecting correctly the donors or or having donor plasma with a very um low concentration of neutralizing antibodies and and the same was good for igg and igm level there was really no significant increase overall in this small group of subjects um in the in the levels of igg and igm and in fact it almost looked like they were producing their own antibodies at their own pace actually the antibodies peaked on day seven the neutralizing antibodies and igg peaked almost a week after the enrollment so it was no relation to the transfusion um and the same thing the the viral load of this patient decreased but it was really decreased after a week of uh of being in the hospital probably not related to the transfusion of plasma so that was somewhat disappointing the only sort of good news is that there was a correlation between the the igg the measurement of igc and neutralizing antibodies both in the donors and in the patient so that means that you can actually measure igg and and if it's very high in the donor it will probably correlate with a high level of neutralizing antibodies so even if your lab doesn't is not able to measure um neutralizing antibody but can measure igg which is useful to select owners and those those were the conclusion that we need to adequately select donors and and and the correlation between um the igg levels against the s protein and neutralizing antibodies so you can use a igg as a surrogate markers marker for neutralizing antibodies if you don't have the capacity to measure which is somewhat complicated requires sometimes a bsl3 or or some other things that are not readily available okay so i'm gonna leave it here and and we can uh start the question and answers thank you thank you nestor so much for that excellent update um before we get started with questions i just want to introduce other hub team members um leslie leslie hayes can you introduce yourself and if you haven't any updates please please please let us have those updates now thanks for having family medicine espanola new mexico just a comment that uh there's some suggestion that um uh trump is pushing oleandran now which is from the oleander plant and has not been studied at all so just be prepared for questions on that so thank you leslie and also i want to introduce marla siebers who is an infectious disease epidemiologist from the department of health here in new mexico marla if you would introduce yourself and and if you have an update first that would be great doctor hi everyone marla sivers new mexico department of health a brief update um you all probably saw the press conference last week and the new slides that were released new mexico as a state is moving in a hopeful direction um we've had five days in a row now without i with uh case counts being under 200 some newly identified cases under 200 our reproductive rate for the state um is less than one it's at 0.73 as of the 12th last week and i know there were some questions um with testing you know changes in testing priorities particularly in the albuquerque metro area many of the health systems that were doing a lot of asymptomatic testing um announced they would only be doing symptomatic testing so there was sort of a question if we were reducing our testing capacity and only testing people who were symptomatic how would that you know affect the numbers that we've been trending but overall our number of tests done each day has not changed we're still testing about 6 800 people a day statewide um so i think that the um reduced positivity rate statewide less than three percent um you know is comparable with um previous numbers um because even though sort of the testing uh strategy changed a little bit we're still testing uh the same number of people each day and finding good results thank you thank you very much marla okay just um before we get into the we'll go ahead and look at the chat questions first um lynn colemeyer do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question sure um can you explain the neutralizing antibodies a little bit more how did you know or why did you only measure them day one i mean in the story you mean uh we measure before and after transfusion uh and the idea is that that once you transfuse the plasma you know after 24 hours you can actually measure and then from then they will decay or the patient himself or herself will produce their their own antibodies so the the what we were expecting was to see an increase in the neutralizing antibodies after you transfuse the plasma because you're giving him you know 200 ml of of antibodies from a person who has recovered so we were expecting this rapid race in the in the next 24 48 hours after the transfusion in the levels of neutralizing antibodies and it didn't move in the grammar occupation there was no effect in in one was actually decrease and in two there was an increase but we thought it was just a random random effect so we were somewhat disappointed and the reason probably i mean we um the the way that the the plasma was selected here was was basically facing had a history of having a positive uh kobe test and they had uh a positive antibody but then we but beta land was so the company was not measuring either neutralizing antibodies or the or the the the elevation in the igg it was just a quantitative uh qualitative yes or no see if the patient was was exposed to copyright or had copied he was a donor our recommendation is that you actually it's better to actually measure the igg or if you if you're able to measure measure the neutralizing antibodies to select better the donor the other thing that we didn't do and it was basically because of the availability we use one unit of plasma per patient 200 ml we didn't adjust it for weight which is another recommendation once you have enough plasma to go around you can actually uh use more if the patient weighs you know more than more than 100 kilos you have to adjust for the weight and we didn't because it was sort of our our you know we are only one unit available for every every patient at the at the beginning of this pandemic so so those are the things that we actually learned we didn't do a comparison we didn't have like a control group so this is all only to to determine the kinetics of the of the neutralizing antibodies and the viral load when we use the plasma that was our main goal and also to see toxicity we didn't see any significant toxicity associated with transfusion itself but it was only 12 12 patients thank you nestor um also a question but from sarah allen about any data on used in 95 masks or if you wear a cloth mask over your used in 95 any more protection right i can i can mention the story that i that i show in the introduction they actually use several expired n95 and they seem to filter as well as as the the brand new n95 so there was no apparent deterioration in the capacity to filter the filtration efficacy of the mask um and i mean regarding the the use of of a surgical procedure mask i think it's more than anything to protect the mass from being soiled with secretions from the patient if the patient is coughing uh and it's just you know it's it's it's a practice that is widespread i've seen it in in many in many places um and and you know it's a way to try to preserve the a95 if you're going to reuse them you just protect them with the with the with the procedure mask on top mostly to prevent it from soiling from from you know from the patient from from the environment thank you nestor i'm going to go ahead and turn that back over to you joanna okay great thanks carla uh thanks nestor marla and leslie for those great comments and same lynn colemier we really appreciate all these great questions from our group everyone is really contributing uh here's a question from dr chris gonzaga from rehoboth mckinley um medical center in gallup um he's wondering with the coming influenza season uh when is the right time to start doing influenza vaccine vaccinations um wondering what your thoughts are uh nestor and wondering what maybe even marla what the new mexico department of health might be kind of putting out there what their recommendations might be nestor what are your thoughts on that no i think i mean as soon as the as the vaccine is available i think we need to use it i forgot at the end of my presentation there were two papers uh published in jama about influenza and kobe there was an interesting interesting comparison of the sentence incubation period in one of those papers um i think probably the the librarian will be able to to show those those two papers but i did start reading on the on the you know on the um simultaneous epidemic that we are expecting or that may happen in the in the fall so i definitely think i mean as soon as the vaccine or the indication is there we need to vaccinate and there's even the discussion of should we monday like in in colleges or some other settings a monday the vaccine and there's a discussion around that because it's really going to complicate if we have influenza circulating and covet circulating it's going to complicate management diagnosis there's so many things that can get really complicated with with a simultaneous circulation i'm still hopeful that what we saw in march the shortening of the influenza season and the way that we are using protective equipment mask hand washing etc may have an impact on this season but it's it's just wishful thinking on my part i mean there's we don't know what's going to happen we certainly hope hope so i love to hear what marla have to say about about the influenza vaccination and what we are expecting for this for this fall i know we are um awaiting some information from the um immunization practices advisory committee about um the influenza season um they've not come out with any updated guidance for the 2020 2021 season um you know i know they typically recommend that getting vaccinated in july and august might be a little bit too early especially for older people because you get reduced protection later in the season typically their recommendation is september and october being an ideal time um to be vaccinated department of health uh public health division is uh working hard on developing vaccine plans for new mexico obviously the pandemic changes the way that we'll need to do things in terms of offering mass vaccine clinics we may see more of the drive you drive through clinics and less emphasis on workplace vaccine clinics or people visiting pharmacies in person but you know those plans are underway but that's what i would expect is that we'll probably um try to come up with plans in conjunction with cdc guidance for appropriate distancing um for those vaccine clinics so i think it'll look quite different than it normally does um and agree we're hopeful that because of all of the mass use and the social distancing that we'll have a pretty light uh flu season there is a triplex um test that has been developed by cdc that simultaneously will test for cobit 19 and flueway and flu b our state public health lab will have that have that from the cdc for the fall influenza season i don't know if commercial labs will be offering that same test i think we primarily will be using it for surveillance purposes to track flu activity throughout the state more than for clinical diagnostics i just wanted to comment real quick that my son's college is making everyone sign a document that they will get the flu vaccine this year and on the covid group i know other colleges across the country are also doing that i don't know how widespread it is but there are definitely colleges great thanks marla and that by the way everyone that was leslie hayes thank you leslie great great comments um another another comment another comments last question from dr gonzaga is can you comment on the strategy to do the home rapid antigen testing versus other platforms of testing for helping mitigate the pandemic while we're all waiting for the vaccine um i wonder what your thoughts are with that nestor and with that i might add that uh carla's gonna we're gonna try to bring uh uh carissa back from tricore in the next week or two also to help with some of these kind of testing questions right well i i think i've discussed these before but i mean there have been a couple of of um papers that use uh mathematical modeling and frequent testing obviously on the right conditions frequent testing if you get the result rapidly and you can and you can act on it and and do the the isolation or quarantine of the the people who are um detected it's it's it's useful obviously uh some of the rapid tests have they have some limitation they have decreased sensitivity so so if you have a in some instances if you have a negative test and you have a high suspicion and you're using one of these less than perfect test you probably have to go ahead and do a more definitive step sort of an orthogonal um you know algorithm to to be able to to make the diagnosis or rule out the diagnosis in some cases so it's a trade-off the the rapid tests do have uh uh use and and they are indicated if if you can if if it's part of our strategy to do a more rapid contract tracing but on the other hand uh you have to uh be cognizant of the fact that you want to have false negative and false positive and you have to plan around that uh and and have sort of a of a reaction to those results too thank you nestor um adella whole green from chaparral new mexico wonders how many times you can reuse the n95 if you're using the surgical mask kind of over the n95 any wondering what you're perhaps doing nestor at unm hospital i mean here i i mean i don't work directly in the cobic units every day i go see patients i enroll patients in the studies so i was given a couple of of n95 and i use it uh and then put it to rest for a few days and then you know use the next one um i don't think there's a clear story i mean like evidence scientific evidence of how many use how many times you can use the mask uh um you know those mascara used to be disposable before this crisis use it once and you throw them away after after after use them um i guess you know going from the obvious to to the more sophisticated explanations i mean if it's if it if the straps are broken or if it's soil uh you obviously have to throw them away or of the elastic doesn't doesn't fit you have to throw them away um but if not you can you can in theory use it and reuse them and they're institutions who are actually resterilizing them with either ultraviolet light or uh hydrogen peroxide so and and you know so far so far um we have been successful with that procedure and in fact there was a publication on the on the prevalence uh or several prevalence of of copied in new york in one of the new york health systems and they found the same prevalence in healthcare workers compared with with the general public and there was no difference if you work with covid without calling if you were a nurse or a or a physician if you were in the er or an administrative functions there was no difference in the cereal prevalence so that tells you that whatever we're doing this universal masking using n95 reusing the n95 seems to be working overall thanks nestor very very helpful um jeffrey miller uh kind of reminds us that one concern that he has with the influenza vaccine is that you know many many people get it from their pharmacies and then you know there's not going to be a lot of social distancing between the pharmacist or the clinician giving the the vaccine to the to the patient so that's an anticipated problem to overcome during during this vaccination period so something to be mindful about um just looking at some more of our questions uh uh i can look into this for alan caro but it would be interesting to see a list of colleges requiring flu vaccines and [Music] i am going to now turn to oh mary zeitner asked a question following up on revac qx if an older person gets revaccinated should it be the regular dose or the senior dose and i'm wondering if you might be able to comment on that uh nestor but re-vaccinated from one year to the other or vaccinated to twice in the same season i don't know um i'm not sure mary zeitner are you able to unmute i think the original question esther was um there was another revaccination question about if if somebody gets a vaccine early like early in this can they get revaccinated in the spring right if they get like an august or a september uh influenza vaccine we can maybe ask clarissa next week right i i don't know to be honest i haven't read of of the uh usefulness of revaccination in the same season like before i mean great um i'm going to turn to some of our pre-registration questions i'll ask a couple and then turn it back over to carla um just wanted to know nestor um have you seen any emerging uh new emerging uh treatments for uh for chronic complications after infections uh you know michelle harkins had a great talk last week on the critical care echo it wasn't really critical care related but it was regarding unm's um post covet infection clinic it was with dr alicia parrata but wondering what what might be on the horizon for any um kind of emerging treatments regarding covid or regarding kind of chronic complications we hear about post post headache post kind of cognitive uh anything that you're seeing on the horizon no i mean nothing like really dramatic what i've seen is description of those syndromes postcard syndrome there was this publication i think i mentioned a couple weeks ago from germany in which they actually describe a surprisingly high percentage of cardiac abnormalities like 78 of those who were tested with a cmr with a cardiac magnetic resonance had some type of abnormalities uh and it was much higher than the control groups that they selected in that story so kobe seems to be affecting the heart more than what we initially thought and in fact the risk of of athletes like student athletes um that develop kobe may have this silent myocarditis and i have seen you know discussion more than anything in podcasts and other and other forums about this this concern about cardiac obviously there's a long lung dysfunction if you have a severe lung infection you're gonna have some degree of limitation and and hypoxemia with exercise we have seen that in our own patients in the research trial that they come you know a couple of weeks after and they're still using the homoxy and they're not able to exercise like they did before kobe so and i i actually saw an article um the librarian is going to kill me it was about about it was actually a perspective active article on on on the approach like post sepsis that we have like there's like a strategy once a patient leaves the hospital with sepsis regular bacterial sepsis uh the the sepsis campaign actually has like a strict follow-up with criterias rehab indication and a whole bunch of interventions that are done once the patient leave the hospital and they were proposing that we need to use the same approach that once a patient leaves the hospital with severe kobe we have to look after his physical well-being the nutrition you know pulmonary rehab etc so try to to approach a postcard as a multi-systemic issue with all the with all the necessary you know concerns uh to improve the the function and and reduces the quality that this patient can can develop but i haven't seen anything specific of a treatment or anything um for the post kobe syndrome thanks thanks so much nestor um one more question that just might be could take probably three hours to talk about so just maybe i would love to just get a short snippet of your thoughts um and it's regarding kind of the the the late the vaccines that have perhaps the most promise their availability their effectiveness and how how your mind works in terms of the ones that are perhaps in phase three trial and how you might look at the results and assess whether or not they might be good let's say for you to uh to try it out you know what what makes you think a vaccine might be ready to go yeah well the way they're designing these phase three trials with a lot of patients we're talking 10 000 30 000 in one of the one of the protocols that they have mentioned i think we're going to have a very robust information on the efficacy and safety um so so if if a vaccine shows efficacy and safety uh in a in a very large sample like the one that i just mentioned over 10 000 uh subjects um i think that that's going to be um you know enough to convince fda and the european agencies to approve those those um vaccine especially under the current situation with with the outbreak and and the impact on the economy and the and the mortality or lethality that we are seeing so i think that that i think that's going to clinch it if we have a well-designed large study with a good result maybe over 50 or 70 percent efficacy of the vaccine with a safety profile that is that is acceptable and not without any any red herrings or any surprises that will do it that will do it and i think at least there are two modalities that are far advanced the mrna the messenger rna vaccine there are a couple that are entering phase three and a couple of adenovirus vaccines are also moving really fast including the the the russian that have no data but they're going to use it in the general population so at some point we're going to gather some information on that one too uh despite all the criticism which is which is uh well deserved but if they use it and they and they study what they're doing they may get useful data from that too so so i think that's it i i think um as soon as the phase three uh are are finished and if there's efficacy uh it's it's gonna be um it's to be acceptable the only caveat is that that you know if we control the epidemic um and there's there are no patients with coping or or the the the prevalence decreases a lot it's going to be difficult to measure efficacy i remember we did a dna study a dna vaccine for zika in my country in panama before i moved here um and the epidemic went away and we couldn't prove efficacy of the vaccine we had the vaccine we vaccinated you know 300 subjects in my center and and but there was no cases zero cases in the country for the next six months and we couldn't we couldn't improve efficacy it was just you know we measure antibodies we measure neutralizing antibody all the fancy laboratory tests but we couldn't prevent a single infection because there was none they were known in the communities that's also important and that's where they're doing these vaccine studies in in brazil in latin america in india in places where the incidence is is going up so they can actually show efficacy so and they're not doing it in italy in france in switzerland because they they're incidents i mean they're having some you know new cases but they don't have the levels that they had in in march and april thanks so much nestor very thorough and we i'm i we all appreciate that that very helpful response back to you carla thanks thanks johanna nestor now that you've become a mask expert there are multiple questions on masks two more that i just want to ask so um dr yoda pat was asking what is it about an n95 mask what is it that makes it have such have such good filtration capacity do you do you know i mean what i know it's number one is the feet that those masks are usually tested in you know by the occupational health department and you actually make a really good fit because if you have an n95 but the air goes through the space between your face and the mask there's no filtering the second is actually the filters the filter that they use in the fabric of the mask actually filters uh small particles less than five microns to a very high 95 that's what it's called n95 95 98 filtration so the the filter material and the fact that it's well adjusted to your face is what what does the trick with this type of mask as opposed to others we do not have that filtering capacity and that are not really fitted to your face yeah and i guess my assumption too is that the surgical masks actually that's probably the reason because they're tighter and they they they fit better i i'm not sure because it seems like they're made of from very similar material you're still you're muted nestor sorry so yeah definitely the difference it's mainly on the on the on the way it's adjusted to the face the one with the with the straps or the or the you know the the it are better than just the ear loops which are kind of you know one size fits all right thank you and then there was another question and linda gorgos brought up the fact that we you know in in our offices that we're all using basically procedure masks not surgical masks and is there she said is there um should we be pushing to get surgical mask use in the outpatient setting since it does look at least from that one study that it may be a better may provide better protection what's your thought about that to be honest i i don't know i mean there's a difference i i think between what you can test in a laboratory what you can you can actually measure when you do use these these instruments to measure filtration and the impact in the real life um you know for instance there's a study from one of the hospitals in boston in which they they uh implemented universal masking with procedure mask it was mostly you know the usual procedure masks which are easy to get and there was a significant decrease in the number of healthcare worker infected just with the procedure myself the one thing is the the you know the laboratory measurement of filtration and the other is the impact of wearing a mask uh in the real life and i think you know we are seeing the benefit of even cloth mask surgical mask and all types of mic even being imperfect they do impact the transmissibility of the disease and they do impact the and they protect the user and the people around them even with these limitations thank you um just a question to people or local from here in new mexico about whether we have enough to marla about the we have enough contact tracers and the specific question was do we have enough contact tracers in our state to cover school starting that's a that's a more complicated question i think but marla can you just comment on the contact tracing situation here yeah i don't have the most recent exact numbers um but there have been lots of news reports about it in the last couple of weeks um new mexico continues to hire new contact tracers um kind of in in batches as we bring groups of people on and get them trained and working in the surveillance system so we continue to ramp up the number of contact tracers even though our case counts are going down part of that is in preparation um you know for a future surge in cases as things open up again you know the school question has kind of kind of been put on hold with the governor saying we won't have in-person classes until at least after labor day so that gives us a little more time um to plan how we'll respond to to school cases you know will will one case mean the whole school is closed or just that classroom i think these are still questions um that need to be answered and that districts and superintendents are thinking hard about um you know if kids are back in school and depending how their classroom is set up how much they're moving around um to the cafeteria or library or other common areas the number of contacts they have will increase exponentially so then you're trying to contact trace more families and more kids which will you know require more resources um but we do have um our time down from the time we identify a positive case until we're reaching their contacts uh down to right around 24 hours now so we've definitely become more effective as the workforce has has grown in reaching context of cases more quickly thank you very much marla um there's a question another question came in um about the status of the monoclonal antibody approach i don't know nestor if you can give an update on what we know so far about the submonoclonal antibodies yeah i haven't seen any publication any large trial i have seen more in vitro studies showing the the capacity the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies but i haven't seen any large publication about monoclonals um yet i just want to make a comment on the contract racing and that it's it's so important there was a study actually it's in pre-publication in the metrics uh database from colombia they actually measure the impact this is the first time a group that measured the impact on mortality of contact racing and and they were able to show that a 10 increase in the contact raising capacity decreases the mortality as as for as much as 3.4 let me just to give you an example the dexameters on the famous in recovery study from uk the the change in mortality with dexamethasone was around three percent between those who got it and those who did not get it so so reducing the mortality of three percent with this disease is comparable just giving everybody dexamethasone with just contact racing and the reason is because contact raising decreases tertiary cases so you you have the the index case the person that you investigate and if you intervene you prevent a third wave of cases as a consequence of those secondary cases so so they were able to show that that data in colombia that in the community where they increase contact creation there was a downturn in the in the mortality really really amazing so that's what is so important and i'm glad um that the doh is it's doing that it's really important yeah thank you yeah super important um nestor have you heard anything or read anything recently about the long-term um someone is asking specifically about the taste and smell when people's taste and smell are actually returning if there's some sort of time period that you can talk to patients about yeah there was a story uh about that and in the in the ent literature um i don't recall the exact percentage but in the great majority of patients after two to three weeks they recover the sense of smell there were some that had like a longer lasting uh incapacity but but in the great majority of patients they recover um you know after after a couple of weeks of having the the loss of sense of smell so it seems to be a temporary a temporary event not up nor a permanent damage and there was also a nice paper on on on the mechanism and and this this group also investigated the mechanism and i think i brought in one of the previous updates in which the the cells affect they were actually the support cells not the neurons the neurons that mediate the transmission of the of the of the chemicals you know signals from this from the sense of smell we're not affected but actually the support cells so and those are cells that in theory can recover it can make are like connected tissue cells that can be uh made again or or can be uh substituted and come back so that that was sort of a the explanation why you lose it and then you get it back uh because it's not an irreversible damage of the neurons that that mediate the the olfactory sense thank you nestor i just wanted to mention to everyone that um that the cme linked to cme went into the chat about five minutes ago so please fill that out if you want to see me credit for this session and also just if you have feedback for us we would love to hear it so i'm going to turn it back over to joanna thanks carla um i think i'm just going to take the liberty of asking a question that i'm really interested in hopefully others will too and marla maybe this this might be a question for you i'm super interested to kind of understand better the successes that the navajo nation has had as well as the gallup uh gallup area and mckinley county in terms of really reducing their community spread and wondering uh if you can possibly talk just a minute about that regarding their kind of mitigation strategies was there one thing in particular was it multimodal i do i just answered you in the chat but i think you know it really was a combination of um all the measures so they had very strict um stay-at-home orders and um you know curfews um so i think that was very effective in their specific um locations and helping reduce spread just that very intense um sheltering in place and stay-at-home orders um you know bringing in supports that made that possible for people so that they didn't have to travel um the distances they had been traveling and be out and about as much to make sure the basic needs were getting met lots of testing and contact tracing of course and then you know they also used a lot of alternate care and alternate housing sites for people who needed isolation and quarantine so they actually set up mechanisms for people um to be isolated positive cases be isolated away from their families in hotels and also other alternate care sites and people who needed quarantine also had that available so you know we we often see um household clusters and in most households and especially if crowding is a factor trying to maintain social distance and and make sure that other people in the household don't become infected is quite difficult um just logistically and so i think especially when you have um areas where you have people very tightly um you know densely housed having those options for alternate sites for isolation and quarantine also made a big difference because you were really reducing that household transmission marla i completely agree with you and uh it seems like it and there's i i just recently went on to the navajo department of health website and it looks like they're still having a 9 p.m curfew um every night i don't know if that is is true but it's certainly if if it is so it certainly seems like it's keep it is helping um i wanted to also mention that catherine uh yeah catherine torres says that it is still true that they're having a 9 p.m curfew catherine also says that she agrees with you and also that the um that no one in in that region is is is fighting wearing masks very patient waiting in lines and so it is an amazing kind of a case study of what really can happen when everybody is really following these public health rules um kent knows where the digital librarian put in a a really good interview that i happen to also listen to with jonathan nez the president of the navajo nation um if you have a chance to listen to that um i just wanted to now go to a few other uh questions that we have also um and that is uh um um any association of viral shedding and infectivity um so wondering um master if you might speak uh to that in terms of uh kind of i think what the person writing the question was getting at is perhaps dose of viral shedding and infectivity you kind of hear about you know it's not so much the um the exposure but like the dose of the exposure and the viral shedding might you speak about that right i haven't seen any clear i mean like an association between uh let's say secondary attack rate in in in homes and and viral loading the in the respiratory secretions what we what we have seen or have been published is that um there's a small percentage of people who actually have very very high viral loads and they and this is something hypothetical but the people think that those uh like you know with extremely high viral loads are those who explain this super spreader event how can a single person in fact let's say 10 people in their church or in their you know classroom or or in the summer camp um but it's sort of a lacks association they assume that because there exists these super spreaders events and there are these people who actually carry several logs higher levels of buyer load there's probably a correlation these uh high viral load subjects explain most of the transmission as opposed to that everybody transmits the same that that's what i think the epidemiologists and the modelers actually think that this is happening that a lot of the transmission it's it's it's um produced by a single or a small group not by the general population and that's what the overall uh reproductive number at the beginning of the epidemic was like 2.6 but we know there are people who have infected 14 so so so they are like this super spreader um but i haven't seen a sod in which they actually have correlated you know viral loads with the number of people in your house that became sick something like that like a clear cut and the other thing is that the viral load is actually very dynamic you have a very high viral load two days before the symptoms a couple of days after symptoms and then decays from there so if you if you take this the sample you know well into the disease you may find a very low parallel you you really don't know if that person was a high viral load subject at the beginning of the disease because it's very it's very dynamic that the the battle shedding is a dynamic even it's not something that that is constant through the disease is actually higher at the beginning and then it goes down as symptoms develop the opposite of influenza and some more diseases that you are more contagious when you are symptomatic in this case it seems to be at the beginning more than at the end thanks so much nestor i wanted to see if uh joanna cooper might be able to unmute and just go back to the um the conversation about the navajo nation and other um pueblos in in new mexico to talk about um joanna yeah i work in zuni right um the numbers have been going down but they've decided to institute a a weekend curfew for the month of august from 8 pm friday until monday morning at 5 a.m just to kind of stop it in its tracks it's hard to say if the success came before that or not but um that's what the that's what zunis decided to do great and are you this is joanna again um and dr cooper had the rates been going down um the prior month july we had a we had the surge i would say maybe the second week in july i think our weekly case count was at 95 they are actually my colleague just sent around a graph um so i think we were up to 95 cases in one day it's a small community so that was a significant number but we've been going down since then so that was our peak um through all of these months that was our peak is i think it was the first or second week in july right or maybe it was at the end of june but anyways around around end of june beginning of july was was our peak thanks joanna good to have you hear your voice and catherine do you want to unmute catherine torres and tell us what's and um tell us a little bit about navajo nation uh good afternoon everyone again thank you for this echo it's very valuable to those of us in rural community the navajo nation has finally lifted their weekend curfew to um it's starting at 9 00 pm on saturday and going until monday at 5. you know they still wear masks navajo nation is starting to open up a little bit where they're allowing their employees to come back to work so they've been a little slow on bringing back non-essential until they had enough ppe and other things in place i found that though sage hospital gave out tents so people could be isolated who were positive from their family so they could sleep in a tent and still be close the only thing that has come up which i put in the chat was fort defiance um health board was approached about doing phase three clinical trials for moderna's vaccine so i was wondering if anybody knew anything about that um and if unm's gonna be participating thanks catherine so much nestor do you know anything about that uh any collaboration no i haven't heard any anything and and as far as i know we we're not doing uh vaccine trials here at unm i would love to but we have we don't have any any candidate we're actually looking for a small molecule um for treatment but not for vaccine thank you thank you um nestor um do you have any it's two minutes before the top of the hour i wanted to let everybody know that the cme link did get put in about 40 at about 12 43 i think it should open as soon as our um session does end nestor do you have any last minute um announcements no just thank everybody for the questions and and keep coming back we'll keep reading and bringing the updates as they come and hopefully we'll get good news in some of the trials that are coming absolutely absolutely i did want to remind everybody we have a few other new mexico echoes um and everybody that's not from new mexico is certainly welcome at two o'clock today we have our weekly first responder resiliency echo on thursday mornings at eight a.m we still have our critical care echo with lots of planned uh didactics that's with michelle harkins and every other wednesday we have a nursing home echo carla back to you yeah thank you joanna um and i just wanted to also mention that the nester is involved in two uh spanish-speaking echoes one that's very similar to this it's just started last week it's on thursdays from four to five p.m and also one on monday mornings from nine to ten so um again there's a didactic on the monday a bigger a larger didactic from someone else on the monday echoes so if you're if you speak spanish and would love to come to those we'd love to have you there as well so yeah that's it i think do you you mentioned the the critical care uh that is going to be covered 19 therapeutic update joanna did not mention the topic so the topic for thursdays as uh cobin 19 therapeutic update plasma and beyond so that's thursday and um i think that's it so really really appreciate everyone being here and we will see you hopefully next week\"\n",
