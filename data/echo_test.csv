0,okay look at your list no it's dinner i'm actually on page 29 of 35 previously we are going off of this now so i need to get rid of the rest some of it don't freak out um yes um hello everybody i'm here hey nestor it's carla good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious disease office hours we're very excited to see everybody here today and welcome to those who've been before and welcome to any new participants as well just a couple of housekeeping announcement announcements before we get started um for those of you who are familiar with project echo we really like to our one of our goals is building community and so we really like to see people's faces so if you do not have if you have a camera and don't have it on we would love for you to turn it on and keep it on during the session if possible we would ask that people keep themselves muted unless they're called on by one of the facilitators we will try as always to answer all the questions that were submitted through the registration and we will also we would also love to hear your questions on the chat so if you have a question during this session please um enter it into the chat box and we'll try to get to those as well um a couple of other things we have a digital librarian who's amazing and and during this process uh during the entire session he'll be putting some links into the chat based on questions that come in so you can always look at the chat too to find more information because of many of you know there's been a lot of security issues with zinc with um zoom lately so we can't actually put hyperlinks in the chat anymore so if you want to go to one of those links you have to copy and paste them and put them into your own web browser and lastly our website is being updated all the time with videos of the sessions and other resources so please please go to that if you want more information okay so i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm going to do a couple of introductions and then i'll ask one question then and turn it over to joanna um i want to introduce our uh office hours with nester sosa who's our chief of uh the division of infectious diseases here at the university of new mexico and he is generously offered his to do this three times a week so we really appreciate it and he's been busy sort of on the front lines and has a lot of good information so nestor i'll have you introduce yourself in just a minute and just give us a little update on anything that you think is important for the group to know and i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and we work closely together she'll be helping to moderate the question question and answer section so nestor why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and please say a few words if you will sure thank you thank you very much carla and thank thank you everybody for one more time connecting and sending those uh excellent questions i think um really on the on the research front we we're starting to see um a couple of publications um a little bit you know debunking the the hope that we have with hydroxychloroquine there was a publication from brazil that actually showed uh increased toxicity when they use the the original molecule the chloroquine molecule especially cardiac toxicity and there is a pre-publication that is going to come out in the british medical journal of probably one of the first comparative trial of hydroxyl chloroquine versus control or placebo and it showed no benefit um and these were close to 180 181 subjects so so i think um we're probably going to be looking into other uh other uh products like rendezvous or maybe the convalescent plasma as some hope for for uh for a useful therapeutic intervention but i think soon we're going to have to be revising the recommendations and and protocols in many of the centers um here in the us uh in you know in view of these uh these results and then we you know continue to follow the very closely the the development of the literature and the scientific uh publications over thank you investor and i wanted to introduce one more person um i wanted to introduce you all to juanita barapa she's a medical director of medicaid here in new mexico and i just wanted to see if she had any announcements from medicaid or hsd that she would like to just share with us today juanita thank you oh hi good uh good afternoon everyone uh i want to thank uh practical and uh faculty you know assist us in learning subject together and medicaid we're trying to take advantage of uh other i shouldn't set advantage but we want to take a full cap capability that the federal government assistance to the state in terms of uh you know the waivers and uh the new way to do business via telehealth or telemedicine and telephone so um hsd and um medical assistant division working around the clock trying to keep up with all these uh blanket waivers to try to bring the uh the um the benefits to the state so i'd like to thank everyone you know hard work and also education to take care of our members thank you so much juanita so i'm going to just ask one question then i'll turn it over to joanna um nestor there's been a lot of questions over the last couple of weeks about masks and um one of the questions from today was does wearing a mask outside make sense and one you know there was a question last week uh last on monday that i don't think we got to that someone asked a very similar thing that these masks aren't masks that that protects you from viruses basically they're not homemade masks or cloth masks and so what does does it make sense what is the reason for wearing them right now yeah that's an excellent question and in fact to be honest at the beginning of the epidemic i didn't see any sense in the general public using mask but with the mounting evidence on especially on asymptomatic transmission or pre-symptomatic transmission it makes makes sense to use a mask more than anything to prevent youth infecting other people so it's actually because there are patients or or subjects that contract this infection and do not develop any symptoms but they can infect their their um co-workers or persons around them it makes sense to wear a mask because that contains to a certain degree the the respiratory droplets the saliva when you cough when you talk so it's more than anything to protect other people than to protect yourself because we know that a simple cloth mask or even a surgical mask is not 100 protective for you um for infection if there are aerosols in the air that contain the virus but on the other hand you are definitely limiting the spread of your respiratory secretions if you wear a mask in public so i think um it makes sense now to to to use that recommendation especially if you're going to be if you're going to go to the grocery store to the supermarket or to any place where you're going to be close to other people in order to protect them it's reasonable to wear a mask and we have seen this in in you know videos and and uh news from from from japan and china that they use it all the time even before the kobe my team was uh discover or prevalent so so now it really really makes sense on the current uh you know information that we have about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transition which is which is pretty um uh pretty significant i mean i just i just saw an article uh yesterday um and published in the new england journal about they actually tested over 200 pregnant females that went to the labor and delivery room and they found that 13 of them had asymptomatic viral shedding as opposed to one point something so it's seven times more frequent to have a young uh person treating the virus without even having symptoms uh than than symptoms so so asymptomatic transmission it's it's it's been appreciated more and more so that it makes sense just to wear a mask to protect others under those conditions thank you thank you nestor thanks carla this is joanna katzman here um i'm going to nestor if it's okay i'm gonna start with some treatment questions but i did want to let everybody know you might have seen the slide before the session and on the chat about the new um cdc covered 19 clinical call center it opened five days ago it's a 24 7 call center for clinicians and um health departments and a close colleague of mine is is manning it and she is referring clinicians actually to our echoes here um as well but she asked me to um let you you all know that this call center is for clinicians um and health departments if they have any urgent questions it i think it is being manned by physicians and advanced practice providers and they're giving cdc guidance and and particular questions so i think it's a really good um thing to know about if you have any urgent questions day and night and maybe to take a little load off of nestor on the pals call 24 7 too so the first question is um is ivermectin nester being explored for treatment after um some studies have shown um some in vitro studies have shown the inhibition of viral rna transcription there has been i know some studies on ivermectin right there is uh at least evidence in vitro that that hybrid mechanism also inhibits the virus there are actually a lot of of uh molecules being considered for clinical trials um i actually reviewed a paper in in journal that actually mentioned over 300 research protocols are being conducted at this moment in the united states and other countries looking for different interventions pharmacologic and otherwise intervention for copic night team i don't know if there's a specific protocol already for hybrid mechan but i wouldn't be surprised because there are many many molecules that have um either immunomodulator effect or direct antiviral that are being evaluated in different clinical trials either alone or in combination uh but but to my knowledge i i haven't really seen a protocol on either mechan um yet but i wouldn't be surprised to be honest thank you um and uh we might have uh touched on this last week but might you touch on it again your thoughts related to the uh timing of remdissevere and this other um immune modulating drug i'm i'm gonna not pronounce it right but uh t-o-l-i-c-i-z-u-m-a-b yeah the toss-illissum yes and and and you know because we we don't have uh well uh randomized control trials everything that i'm going to say sort of in analogy to what we know from other viral infections in general um you know this this viral infection and kobe 19 is not an exception it's actually pretty typical uh there is a component that the virus um that is it's it's the fault of the virus it's virus directed inflammation but then there's an uncontrolled immune response uh and and damaging immune response that also uh activates the coagulation cascade uh activate the cytokine storm so we have sort of uh you know two two phases to this disease that the viral and the immunologic i think for in general for antivirals to work they need to be used earlier so i wouldn't be surprised if most of the study points to our earlier rather than late uh efficacy for these drugs so if you use a antiviral probably late in the second week when the patient is already in icu it's probably going to be very hard to show efficacy uh and so so in general i think and this is true with influenza the earlier you use the antiviral the the better uh chance the patient have to to to have a good recovery or or or or do not advance to more severe disease on the other hand there are some drugs that have been or that i have that they are being considered in the in the more advanced patients and toscilisumati is an example because toscilicium it's a it's a it's an inhibitor of il-6 one of the cytokines that are elevated uh in the cytokine storm that this patient experienced so i think some of those immune modulators may be more useful in a sub-population of patients that actually have this severe inflammatory state um on the other hand there's there's mounting evidence that probably early anti-population something like low molecular weight heparin prophylactically maybe it may be useful in hospitalized patients so so you know we are learning a lot but i think if anything antivirals and including convalescent plasma are going to be useful if anything at the beginning early in the disease uh more than really late um and and some others may maybe still have some usefulness late but it will be mostly in the immune modulator uh or trying to quiet down the immune system at the end to prevent the excess inflammation excess correlation etc thanks mister i think you answered a couple of the questions under the treatment someone else i that dr urbina from akama asked kind of how would you suggest using low resource how would you suggest low resource institutions or kind of maybe critical access hospitals modulate this cytokine storm to prevent this moderate to severe disease but i think you answered that you gave a lot of kind of ideas in that in that sense um let me ask you one more question then i'll turn it over to carla is there any proof that a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be gifted be given has that been disproven nestor right there is no evidence one way or the other at the beginning there was a general sort of a blanket recommendation from wa show and i think an official in france uh who actually a health official in france france who said that they were somewhat contra indicated um but i haven't seen any solid evidence in favor or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs what i say all the time if you use it for just fever control it's probably better to use a safer drug like like acetaminophen or paracetamol paracetamol at this point because we have no evidence of efficacy or or toxicity um and and there are some uh studies that that the non-steroidal may increase the number of receptors the h2 receptor so the i think until we have solid evidence i would say if you if you have a fever and you're at home with the kovid just take acetaminophen if you need to take anything uh for the fever um as opposed to to nonsteroidal until we really learn with more solid evidence if they are uh deleterious or or or if they help in any way thank you nestor before we move away from the treatment questions do you um can you just give an update about what uh clinical trials are going on at unm sure yeah we have several of them uh we have a uh one of the earliest trials that we started was the hydroxychromoquin combined with acetomycin right after we saw the the study from the french and the endorsement of the fda for for this combination we started an open label trial for patients and and we have been using hydroxychromic when combined with acetomycin in some of the patients that are in icu this is an open label study so we're probably not going to learn a lot from it i mean we have the some patients that did not use that combination so we will have at least historical controls uh but as i said it's just a it's an open label study mostly um directed towards allowing us access to the drugs um but now that we are sort of accumulating evidence of probably the the inefficacy or or or lack of efficacy of uh hydroxychloroquine and in fact some issues about toxicity because there's a carrier toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin also has the same uh problem with the prolongation of the qtc the the qtc segment in the ekg which is associated with some uh really dangerous ventricular arrhythmias so so we're probably going to move away from those drugs and then we are actually discussing them on each other about that that trial there's also uh we are in the planning stages of using convalescent plasma which is the other tool and we in fact we have we are applying to four different protocols one protocol in prophylaxis let's say a person like a family member close family member of a copy patient the question is can can that person receive plasma and prevent the disease from from uh from establishing itself so there's a there's a pulse exposure prophylaxis and also for a healthcare worker exposed so we have we are working on on starting that trial for possible exposure prophylaxis there's another trial for ambulatory patients patients that that are test positive but they are um not sick enough to be hospitalized can we give them convalescent plasma uh to prevent hospitalization and then there are two other trials for for uh mildly ill and and severely ill patients um looking at convalescent plasma there are a couple of um of sort of basic science studies that we are planning also to see the mutation rate of the virus to see the immune response of the virus the group from global health are actually planning uh these are more uh biological and immunological studies than than therapeutic studies so we have you know quite a few uh clinical trials which are about to start are in the process of carrying getting irb approval uh some of the them are local trials others are multi-center so we're participating with with tough university and uh and and um and also other universities to to develop these these multi-center uh trials thank you so much so i'm going to ask a couple questions about testing and screening um one of the questions from uh from somebody ackman also somebody in clovis given results in new england journal of medicine regarding pregnant patients should all pregnant and patients be screened for cobit 19. yeah i think this is a really powerful story uh uh obviously the the right answer you have to know what's going on in your community you're not gonna test uh all pregnant females if there's no community outbreak in in your area but if you're in an area where there is like you know widespread community transmission um it's probably based on these evidence it's probably a good idea to test in order to protect yourself i mean your your team your healthcare workers and and also know that that the that the mother is it's a copy positive and takes some actions regarding the the newborn also so i think it does makes make some sense uh but we have to see the the prevalence of the disease in the community the availability of resources the the including the tests the swaps to make up you know a more precise decision regarding regarding this uh this strategy sorry about that thank you nestor um do you i know that our department of health colleagues aren't on today but do you can you go over the latest criteria in new mexico for testing you you want me to go over yeah no i'm just saying i don't marla's not on today but if you if you can go over that that would be great yeah i think uh the the most uh like important criteria is symptomatic patient patients who have symptoms suggestive of covet including some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia or loss of sense of taste may trigger the need for the test they have also increased the number of or or increased the indication to certain situations where there's a congregation of people like uh in prisons jail nursing homes you can do testing even in asymptomatic patients those are the general guidelines um obviously the department of health um when they're doing an investigation of an outbreak they they also have some um you know flexibility in doing the test to the contacts and people around them but but it's really symptomatic patients and um in places where there is congregation of people like like nursing home jails and other and other instances where there's there's a lot of people living together thank you very much and a couple of other i know that i'm not sure if you know the answer to this but um one of the questions from uh albuquerque as well as is there any rapid testing in new mexico and i know we talked about this a little bit on monday and we don't have carissa un unfortunately on the line but if you if you want to speak to that nester yeah i can tell you what i know i mean i've been in so many zooms meetings at different levels that i have some information obviously not final thing but i know the the a person from the state lab commented that the state was receiving 30 able machines these are the 15 minutes uh rapid testing machines and they're going to distribute it mostly to like rural hospitals or areas where they don't have ready access to to testing so that was really good news they still don't have enough of the reagents or the cartridges that this machine use but they're going to receive more in the next few days if they haven't received it so so yes we're going to have some of this rapid testing obviously only 30 so far but 30 is better than zero so we're going to have some places especially in the highly affected areas that are going to have access to to this test i know also that we at unmh probably will get uh cartridges for the gene expert which is which is a relatively rapid test it's not like 15 minutes but it gives you an answer in less than less than an hour uh so we may be able to have that test available and that is important because we have seen cases for instance patients who come and need like emerging surgery or delivery or they're going to deliver a baby or they need some acute intervention and they may have symptoms objective for kobe they may have you know a little bit of cough or fever and but they they have another medical problem like an acute mi or they need emerging appendectomy and and it's good to to have a test so you can rapidly triage those patients okay they have some respiratory system but they're called negative so you can go ahead and do the procedure and don't waste uh you know uh ppe etc so i think there's a place and we are gonna get the rapid test and before and before i get asked there's also uh in development the the serologic test and they said that in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks uh we're gonna have a serologic test to detect igg i don't know how i mean at the beginning they're gonna probably have a learning curve and and they're going to be increasing their capacity initially will be restricted somehow um as it happened with this pcr base test at the beginning that it was available but very limited but i think in a matter of several weeks we'll probably be able to have this or logic test also more readily available across across the state which is good news uh because when the when the search passes we really want to know how many people what percentage of the population was affected and it's going to be important for like returning back to work see if you're if you have been exposed or not and other interventions that i think serological tests may have some useful usefulness thank you nestor and just as a reminder to those everyone next monday david grenache who's leading the um serologic testing at tricor is going to be on so he can give us an update about where we're at with zerologic testing thank you over to you joanna thank you so much carla i wanted to let you know also um that uh uh elizabeth uh rosenbaum who uh runs uh the former united blood services now by talent is uh is willing to come on and talk about uh the serology and um the you know plot plasma um ex you know plasma exchange um nester that probably in the next week or two so that would be a help as well um i i wanted to know if um uh diane gassin or teresa chavez was on the line if they wanted to unmute and ask their question about um about immunity after being infected are you are are you are either of you on the line diane or teresa okay um and i wondered if peggy spencer was on the line dr spencer okay peggy sorry hey peggy hey there you are i saw you earlier good to see you um do you want to ask your you had a couple of really good questions everyone's questions are great i wanted to see if you might want to answer your questions directly i don't remember what they were um they were about the um the advising patients to um you know if they are symptomatic at home covet positive getting in a prone position would you like to ask oh yeah oh yeah um because i'd heard about proning being used in the hospital so i was just wondering about advising people at home whether that's a good idea for them at home to keep if that's if there's any evidence that that helps it keep it from progressing yeah that's a great question and i haven't seen any publication for for data at home but i have been in several um presentations where experts icu experts from especially from the east coast are are uh you know relating that patients especially in the icu when they are placed on the prone position they improve their oxygenation and it has to do with with several factors with the with the blood flow within the lungs at the location of the the most affected areas and the lungs of brony seems to be helping i saw also and this was just a slide in one of the experts that actually mentioned that they were doing voluntary prone in the in the emergency department and in the in the general awards because of the same reason because we have used prone in before in icus and intubated patient but they are suggesting that there's probably uh also benefit of doing it outside icu i guess like in in the emergency room or general wars i haven't seen anything at home for that it would be interesting to to do a study and see because it's relatively simple i mean you can do it with a pulse oximeter and measure if the oxygenation improves but i have seen that i haven't seen any literature just as i said expert opinion part of presentations uh but i haven't seen any written like you know like a recommendation to actually implement prone on on patient but it's really a good question and i think it's not difficult to answer that question because you can you can do a before and after with with the pulse oximeter and see if actually patients improve by changing the position voluntarily thank you so much dr spencer um dr sosa i i'm wondering if you might be able to address this a little bit one of uh our our colleagues dr strumminger sent us a um just uh just some email uh literature this morning about delaying um putting someone on a ventilator because it might not be as useful as we had once thought um can you can you kind of uh critique that and kind of say what you think about that yeah again i want to say the disclaimer that i'm not an icu person and this is not my my strength but i have seen uh the comments going back and forth in the icu community um some people claim that that we're probably uh intubating people too early and and that actually ventilatory support may be damaging for the lungs in some cases um but i have seen the other the other comment also because if you delay intubation and you have to do it on an emergency basis because the patient is really short of breath they can even go into cardiac arrest and be a more difficult integration so so i i mean i i'm not going to say in i'm going to not going to be on one side or the other i think we need to look at the evidence and actually ask the experts from icu what is the latest on that on that but i know it's a concern uh and it's a difficult decision because when you have a patient that it's you know having trouble breathing and you're actually uh agonizing over should i intubate him and it's every day in all hospitals uh that decision is made and it's a difficult one because you know that that the mortality once they're intubated it's very high in some in some publications 50 others have seen up to 80 percent mortality once they they developed the ards the cytokine storm and go into a into a mechanical support so i think the jury is still out is the ventilator you know more makes more harm than good um it's really difficult to tell at this stage thank you great thank you i wanted to see if um if lisa cope is on if she would like to ask her question it came through the chat but i just wanted just to give a little bit more context and explain the question a little bit more lisa if you cannot meet yourself okay yes yeah i know but at least is one of the uh administrators here but uh my name is rajeev patel i'm a pulmonary intensivist at uh rehoboth hospital and gallup and we have a 54 year old uh woman who is chronic dialysis who's now trached after spending i think 18 days um uh with an endotracheal tube and she's doing actually quite well minimal event support but uh the quest so her third swab was negative we did a confirmatory uh after 24-hour interval that came back positive so i was gonna check a fifth uh after one week but i'm just kind of making that up um and i i don't know what other people are doing when you've got a negative and the confirmatory turns positive can you speak to that yes yeah that's very difficult and let me just give sort of a more general perspective i mean what we are measuring with this pcr it's rna it's the presence of rna in the in the respiratory secretion not actually unfortunately we don't have a sensitive enough tool to to measure infecting virus we're just measuring a section of the virus the rna and we know for instance if we use the analogy of tuberculosis people who are treated and no longer infections may still have dna of the of the bacilli for weeks or months in the respiratory secretions and that doesn't mean that they transmit uh so something similar may be happening with this virus we are detecting intermittently especially in patients that have had like a a really complicated course and we've seen this in the literature that they persist positive or they are intermittently positive do that means that they are transmitting the disease because they have uh the presence of the virus in their i mean the presence of the rna of the virus we do not know the there is a german study in which they actually tried to culture the virus they use cells to culture the virus and they were not able to culture any virus if there were less than 10 to the six so one million copies of rna after below that threshold they were not able to co to culture in cells the virus so so we know that that that rna is probably much more sensitive uh to detect rna than to detect infectious virus so so it's it's a difficult question in that case if the patient is going home um i wouldn't have any problem you know sending the person home but if it is with a tracheostomy it's going to like like a skill nor facility then you you really have to follow the cdc recommendation of having two consecutive uh negative uh rnas but but i still i don't think we're do we are sure that that is necessary and we'll probably learn more when we do you know other epidemiological studies with these patients who are discharged they actually still infection my feeling is that once the patient has you know neutralizing antibodies and and are clinically improving and are not coughing on a fever even if they have rna in their respiratory secretion they're probably not as infectious as they were in the first five days based on the data that we know from from some of the cruise ships and that they have done cultures and and also pcr and this german study that i mentioned um that that was also very well designed although it was really small but very well designed in which they were not able to culture buyers after certain days of disease progression thank you nestor and an important question just came through the chat was sort of related to this can you review which patient should have or might need a confirmatory testing or sequential testing can you talk a little bit about that yeah i think the the main indication if the person is not going to be discharged home but it's going to a to a facility where there is more you know more people living together um that that some centers are are asking for a negative actually two consecutive negative uh tests separated by 24 hours if the patient or the person is going to go home and can be isolated at home i think that there's no need for him to be negative as long as he's following the isolation the home isolation rules and and preventing their relatives to be being exposed to the buyers so i think that's that's uh the the the i think the general rule that they are they are asking for that if they're going to be transferred to another facility or to a rehab or or some skill nor facility that they are negative but otherwise otherwise uh if they're going to go home they can go home because we are sending people with positive copied home if they don't have any symptoms so that's that's essentially the the issue here thank you and you know i think that a little bit of the confusion is about the the use of the word confirmatory because it sounds like you have one test and then you have a confirmation test but but you're just talking about the one pcr test correct correct yeah they're the same test done twice it's just because of the intermittency of the positive test that's what they they ask for two consecutive i mean probably if you do three maybe the third is positive but the rule says two if you have two negative you're you're good to go um with the information that we have and follow in cdc recommendation but again you know we're probably overdoing it we probably you know in a patient who's 21 28 days into their illness and they have clear the secretion clear the x-ray they are a fever they're not coughing you know the chances that they are transmitting it's small not zero but probably small from what we have seen in this in the published story so far thank you nestor and i'm going to ask a couple of questions about immunity and transmission there was a question that came through the chat about if a mom has copied 19 is she can she breastfeed her baby yeah i think uh uh you know breastfeeding is okay uh the problem is i mean there's no evidence of transmission through through the milk the problem is also also the the close proximity of the baby to the mother so there's there's it's not just the breastfeeding itself the the milk itself as a as a way to transmit is the the proximity of the mother to the child that puts a risk to this to this baby so it's really a difficult difficult uh question to answer in the in the practical sense thank you and i know that um there's not a clear answer to this yet but can you just talk about what we know about people who are and how what their immunity is like after their if people are immune after they get infected right yeah that's a that's a great question you're right we don't have a definitive answer and i'm gonna just mention several things we know uh we have some experience with before i mean we have the endemic coronavirus and we have stars and mirrors what we know from the from the old coronaviruses from the endemic coronavirus that are associated with common cold people do develop immunity but the immunity doesn't last too long it lasts you know for months maybe a couple of years and then it goes down because we know that these coronaviruses actually come back every few years and they actually alternate there's one coronavirus circulating and the others are suppressed then the following year you have another coronavirus and so on and so forth so we know that coronavirus in general induces immunity when when when a person is infected we know that there's immunity also to stars and tumors in there are patients who had sars in way in the in you know 20 years ago and they had some detectable immunity so if this virus is going to behave the same we are going to have some degree of immunity regarding kobe 19 specifically you know we know we don't know too much about it but we know that there are patients who recover that have neutralizing antibodies because that's actually the marker that we're using or one of the markers that we're using to to uh to select convalescent plasma to use as treatment that the person have titles of neutralizing antibodies neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent cells in the laboratory from being infected there are there are sort of protective antibodies um because they attack the virus they attach to to a very important part of the virus which is a spike protein and prevent the virus from entering the cell so it is safe to assume that is if a person recovers and develops this neutralizing antibodies that person should be protected well we don't know really it's it's how long those those um protective antibodies are gonna last it's gonna be you know six months a year two years we do not know because you know this virus is only four or five months old um so we don't really know what the effect on the on the immune system and the same goes for the vaccine if a successful vaccine is developed we don't know if we're going to have to use it every couple of years every year like influenza because we don't really know what the need is going to be and there's also the possibility of some uh mutation and evolution of the virus the virus under the pressure of of the immune system may have uh mutations in their spike protein and other important parts of the viral may change over time when they're circulating in you know in thousands and thousands of human beings there may be some changes in the virus and we may need to reformulate the vaccine or people may need to have a different um or may have a second infection at some point in the in the in the future if the virus mutates a lot so those are all you know interesting things but we still don't know the definitive answer for most of those of those questions and that is something that that uh you know makes public health uh officials worry because we can have you know circulation of disaster for a longer period of time we have second wave we may need a uh reformulation of accidents when they are available etc so it's it's it's tough i mean the future is too complicated thank you um this is joanna here um i was wondering if octavia had a chat question and i'm wondering if she's on the line if she might be able to unmute for us and ask um her question yes i'm here a physician approached me this morning we definitely are for those patients under investigation and um covet 19 patients using the proper ppe he he said recently acog released something that says that we should wear the ppe and n95s for all second stage i looked on the site i could not find anything for everyone because of the new study out saying that so many people walk around asymptomatic and could actually have it and because second stage they're pushing the amount of aerosols in the air so i was wondering if anybody else heard anything no i haven't heard about that but i can tell you what we are doing here in um unm and and and i agree i mean there is there are uh some evidence that this virus can survive in the air we know that there are experiments in which they have they have actually taken samples from the air of in rooms of patients and they are able to find the virus there we know that there are some procedures that generate aerosols um like intubation cpr and relationship and other natural which in theory can contain the virus but then again the the measures that we recommend um because the main transmission mode is actually through droplets so to large droplet or direct contact with patients um most of the most of the contacts with patients are done with just contact precautions and and droplet precautions you don't need to use the n95 in all the situations when you are near one of these patients unless unless the patient is um you know a mechanical ventilation or they have they are going to undergo a procedure that generates aerosols because we know although in theory uh there could be uh you know viral particles in the air the chances and and the practical chances are are really small and and we gather these from from you know for instance uh the healthcare workers mo a lot of the haircut workers that get infected is because they're not using any ppe or or they didn't put a mask on the patient or actually they got in the community not necessarily because they were using contact precautions um so that's what the recommendation the general use of contact precaution and there's also another reality and it's the limited amount of n95 mass uh so you have to use it when really need it if you have a limited amount it's just a rational thing to do to use and only when when you are at high risk of being exposed to aerosol as opposed to you know in all contacts with patients that you put into you that you need so are you putting not just general ma mass on all patients during second stage um yeah i don't know if you can clarify what do you mean by second second stage when and when it's time to deliver because that's when we get all the pushing and grunting and all the interesting things we do i haven't been to the labor and delivery i will defer that question to maybe the infection control colleagues um because i i don't know what what type of pp they're using inside the the labor and delivery room here at unm uh yeah and i don't mean those that's tested positive or under suspicion i see allen waving but here if you can answer i'm listening i've also a physician a retired physician uh i have not found a publication a medical publication but i can tell you that it is now a common practice in all obstetrical units along the east coast in all women active in active second stage labor or if coughing are currently having a routine surgical mass placed on them okay uh no as to my knowledge no one's putting n95 on patients the last time that was recommended was by dr scars at the very start of this and that's now been retracted n95s are reserved for individuals who are in situations where there's definite um you know you're working on a definite positive we're just too short of 95's of importance there is an article that showed up in archives internal medicine a letter from april the 8th i believe that has subsequently been debunked that was a small chinese study suggesting that there was no significant difference between folks wearing a mask and coughing that study has been debunked because there was no negative control what they did in that case is they put out small containers of viral transport media they had patients cough as a positive control they found roughly uh 10 to the third log base 10 to the third to 10 to the fourth number of viruses from just open coughing these were active covenant patients four of them and they put on a mask and they had them cough and surprisingly they had very little difference in the number of organisms found what that ultimately proved they did not do a negative control what that proved is that after you cough there are a lot of particles that continue to stay in the atmosphere so without a negative control that that study failed but the general understanding is that a routine surgical mask does significantly decrease the number of virus particles that can transmit out especially in large droplet it's not going to stop things that are smaller than 5 microns we don't believe that most of the viruses coming out of individuals as they cough are that small so definitely i think the strong recommendation currently is that routine surgical mass either procedure type or tie type should be placed on women as they move into active labor and begin breathing heavily okay that's the current recommendation that i've seen that's the current practice thank thanks dr caro thank you and thank you octavia can't pronounce it thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much um dr sosa i'm going to move on to one more question and give it back to carla if a person is exposed to someone with uh who's covet positive when when might you test that person if they become sick when might you test that person or might you not test that person how long would it take uh for a test to become positive in general the first i mean it depends on the strategy are you using uh if the person is asymptomatic and it's not within one of the recommended protocols you don't have to test them but you have to instruct the patient to uh to to enter a quarantine of 14 days to prevent in case they develop the disease to transmit it to others usually the incubation period for this disease is around five days and we know that probably 48 hours before the symptoms are present patients uh start to to uh to disseminate or may disseminate the virus so you know the testing it's it's indicated really when they develop symptoms most of the time so but but we know from from studies that were done especially with the cruise ships affected um that there were people who excreted the virus two days before they actually developed symptoms and we know now for more from more recent studies that there are there are patients who develop who do not develop symptoms they're actually uh pcr positive and as i said with the study with the pregnant females that was a proportion of seven to one so seven um to one more frequent uh asymptomatic shedding than actually symptomatic setting in those in those uh labor and delivery uh patients or patients at the end of the of the of pregnancy so so there's definitely a lot of asymptomatic excretions but the moment for testing is when you develop symptoms based on the on the current recommendation unless there's another um you know factor that makes you tested earlier if the person is in a nursing home or or within another uh situation when there's a lot of people in the same physical space thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually ask one of my dear colleagues robert gish to unmute himself and ask the question about iga all right thanks these echo sessions have been fantastic nestor carla the rest of your team i really appreciate being involved that i shaved today so i could turn on my video just so you know i was off before um i've been very interested in the antibodies uh nestor and the rest of the team here about this whole issue about protection immune status neutralizing antibodies etc i keep reading more information at iga as a secretory antibody for gi and lung may be absolutely critical and are we testing for iga what proof do we have that iga may be protective should all the new tests come out including abbott came out with a test today for covid hiv hepatitis b hepatitis c that was released and covered on the lay press today anyway so iga is the main question thank you yeah unfortunately robert i haven't i haven't seen anything there's a good story and i'm trying to remember uh where was it published out of china in which they and i think the title is like immune reaction or immune uh uh response to copy 19 in which they detail um the different antibodies that are produced obviously secretory iga should be key to decreased uh infectivity and transmission but i haven't seen any any anything specific about that nor have i seen any any uh tests that involve iga most of them that i've seen are igg rgm combination not actually iga so it would be really interesting to see if there any but i haven't seen any i'm going to actually look into into that and review that article from the chinese to see if they actually measure i think they mentioned something about idea but i'm i'm not sure because i don't remember out of the top of my head the details of the of the measurement uh quest is going to have a soft roll out of an antibody test and i've asked them or advised them to add iga to that panel so expect here's something from quests in the next 48 to 72 hours great thank you to both of you um i just wanted to to let everybody know that the cme link for the session is now in the chat box again you have to copy it and paste it into your own web browser but it's it's sometimes hard to see because it gets lost in all the questions but um it came in there from elena martinez so you can take a look at that and i'll ask another question mr um there was a couple more questions well actually i'm going to ask a sort of big picture question which i know you don't know the answer to but you can at least give us your opinion there are several um there are several questions just about when we anticipate our peak in cases in new mexico and also a question about if you know of any plans for new mexico to join other states for development of sort of a reopening plan after the shut this shutdown you're right i don't know the answers to this question no just kidding i'm going to give you my opinion no actually uh yeah i've seen a couple of models there's a model that have been developed by uh by the um by a group that is actually advising the governor and and you know this mother had been moving and they they they seem to be expecting a peak in the middle of may that's what i heard and there are different type of peaks depending on what intervention that what measures are are um are taken or sustained until until that point and and also the the same modeling includes different predictions regarding beds icu beds and ventilators so it's really complicated uh but at least we know that that that uh you know in in some instances the people will be you know in some of the models i've seen late april and they go all the way to middle of may and then hopefully a descent um into june um i i don't know the answer to the to the second question definitely not thank you nestor and i i this is another hard question i i think you went over testing already but uh marianne spencer was wanting to know is there any testing of healthcare workers who are asymptomatic no we're not we're not routinely testing at least here at unmh uh asymptomatic persons if they have been exposed and and exposed meaning a close contact so somebody examine a patient or spend more than a few minutes with the patient without the appropriate ppe and then we know that that person has been exposed then they go into quarantine and they have some close follow-up of symptoms but not routine testing as far as i know and until this this this um this point great thank you and one other testing question that came through we're still hearing that um around the country even symptomatic people can't get tested is that a problem here in new mexico uh you know that i don't know i i mean it's not it's not an issue here for us at the university hospital we we have been increasing and tricore has been really increasing their capacity to the point and now we get an answer in less than 24 hours sometimes even you know half a day uh we can get an answer and a and if it's uh you know recommended by one of the physicians based on the symptoms that the patient is tested so but i i cannot speak for the rest of the of the state which i know it's there are different conditions in different areas of of the state yeah i mean i know from just from from i'm talking to colleagues that the availability is is very good for testing in new mexico as far as i know and i don't know if there's anyone on the line that's having trouble getting tested getting tests but but there there are a lot of different places where people can actually get tested at this point so joanne i'm going to turn it back over to you for the last couple of questions sure um what i might just add is that i'm gonna refer people back again to the new mexico department of health covid um website and actually the state yesterday just put out a really nice interactive map that actually shows the testing sites by county as well so there's a link from health and human human services division back to department of health so there's the department of health really has a nice interactive map that you can get to about test sites and they also doing the um calls like it was a call today from the hospital association and they went over state statistics great thing thanks octavia um fantastic um i wanted to ask um uh nestor about um just in general possibly unm university of new mexico but in general um the visitor guidelines uh we're hearing a lot just nationally but also locally um what the visitor guidelines are or perhaps the the kind of strictness of um kind of no visitors being allowed can you might might be able to go over that as as far as you know no i'm sorry johanna i'm not familiar with the visitor that have been implemented by infectious control with the hospital leadership and i haven't really paid attention unfortunately i've been so busy with the you know all the other stuff that i i don't i've see i've seen very few visitors but i would wouldn't be qualified to answer that question to be honest what i can do is i can take this question and and we can ask it on friday at our covet echo um where we'll have um either megan brett or another doctor striker another hospital epidemiologist and there were a lot of good questions related to ventilators today and i want to let our participants know we also have a critical care echo every thursday from eight to nine in the morning and michelle harkins uh leads that echo and so um for those questions too those might be uh directed towards michelle and critical care questions as well i might ask one more question and james urbina from acoma wants to know about different um supplements like uh um tumeric and cucumber um and how they're being used in terms of investigational studies in terms of um il-6 suppression and immune modulation have you heard anything nestor about using some supplements and in terms of um immune suppression no unfortunately i haven't the the only thing that i have seen because i've seen many protocols from different places both in europe and here are the inclusion of of for instance vitamin c uh they're people just empirically using uh high doses vitamin c i have seen also the inclusion of zinc supplementation in the diet because we know that zinc has some uh utility in in common cold in other respiratory viruses i have seen the use of statins interestingly enough uh statins as you know has some anti-inflammatory rheologic properties and and so there there are researchers and and even a clinician using statins or maintaining statins on their on their patients as a way to decrease inflammation but i haven't seen anything on on turmeric or or or that those specific supplements as an anti-inflammatory uh but i've seen a lot a lot of things been used obviously without much support but but people are are sort of trying or testing their different uh different uh things that that you know to a certain point makes sense but but nestor but but zinc and vitamin c so some maybe some um water-soluble vitamins that are antioxidants perhaps right nestor any last minute um we have about two minutes to the top of the hour any closing statements i think the most important thing and actually want to do sort of a pitch in favor of the convalescent plasma because there are a lot of providers here at some point we're going to need um convalescent plasma to to to treat some of the patients when we're doing the clinical studies either prophylactic or therapeutic so if if if you can talk into your positive patient those who are taking care of calling patients to encourage them or their relatives that are positive to approach when the when the moment is right to approach uh you know the blood banks or the places where they donate blood and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma we would be great i hope we're probably going to have like a media advertisement to disregard but i think you know a patient to provide or provided to patient uh recommendation or suggestion is so powerful so so i would definitely encourage if if you if you are treating patients with kobe that that are uh you know minimally symptomatic or doing well at home if you can ask them at some point when when vitalan and the red cross are ready to receive them which is going to be very soon to actually to actually do it because we're going to need a lot of convalescent plasma um and and that would be that would be you know a good a good um thing to do to help the patients thank you so much nestor we're right at the top of the hour so thanks again everyone for joining um we just as a reminder the cme link is in this uh is in the chat box and multiple times now if you can go in there and copy it and um joanna mentioned our other echoes but we do have four out of the five days of the week have covered related echoes and you can learn you can find out more about them on our website into the code 19 page so thank you so much everyone for joining and we will see you hopefully soon joanne dr cassman yes check your email uh the society for wgyn hospitalist has put out a protocol uh strongly recommending uh masking for patients in active labor whether uh coveted positive or coveted unknown all so take a look at your email okay sure thanks you,,4/15/2020
1,couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started uh a couple of things um here at project echo is all of you i mean a lot of you know we really like to see people's faces and we feel like that helps to build communities so if you can turn your cameras on if you have them we would love to see you uh we would ask that you stay muted during the session unless we you're called on by one of the facilitators we had a lot of questions that came in before the um in pre-registration and we'll try to get to as many of those questions that pop as possible but we would also like to hear from you who are on today and if you have questions please put them into the chat uh you'll also notice in the chat there will be a lot of um a lot of information going in there from kent our digital librarian who puts when when they hear something he'll look for a resource and put it in there and they're really excellent so keep an eye on that if you want you have to copy those hyperlinks because you cannot uh click on them directly in the chat and also just um as a reminder we have a website for covet 19 and there are a lot of resources that are going into that website as well so let me go ahead and get started i just want to do a couple of introductions so first i want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman from project echo who will be helping me with the questions and answers uh later in the session i also want to introduce dr nester sosa who's the chief of infectious diseases here at unm um and we'll hear be here to answer a lot of questions and we have um and also uh see carissa call breathe who's at tricor who's also on the call well we have a special guest today dr david garnach who is going to give us some information about serologic testing and david is the chief scientific officer and the medical director of the core laboratory at tri-core and he has uh joined us today to again talk about serologic testing there's there's going to be a um there's been many many questions that have come through on this network about serologic testing so we thought it'd be good to hear it from him and then he'll also be able to hopefully answer some other questions that you have so we will go ahead and get started now and david if you can just unmute yourself we'll share your slides and you can just uh tell us when you want them to to advance okay sure if you can hear me all right yeah all right well let's get started uh so thanks for the invitation uh to come and speak to the group about uh serological testing is as um as you mentioned uh it is a hot topic and we get many many questions every single day the tri-core about them so i put together a few slides just to as uh you know share some knowledge and then i'll try to answer any questions you might have so we go the next slide please so um we know oh could you go back one side so yes stereological testing for uh cov2 is certainly going to be important uh but it's a really to set expectations we have to understand the limitations uh of serological testing for this infection as we know it today so the value is really kind of limited it will be able to tell you if someone was infected in the past but right now there is not a good amount of data to indicate that these tests indicate that someone is immune there are some early data that suggests that people who have antibodies to cov2 are at lower risk of reinfection but there's no definitive proof so we should not make the assumption that uh having a positive test for antibodies means that you have immunity we shouldn't use the results of serological testing to decrease social distancing or decrease ppe requirements of healthcare workers another way that uh serological testing could be used is to identify convalescent plasma donors right so people who have uh had the infection and have uh antibodies that can be uh that's in their plasma and their plasma can be given to people who are really critically ill as a way to help ameliorate their um their their symptoms and improve their i get them well again and there are some programs going on right now uh that are exploring the use of convalescent plasma um and then it is it's potentially possible to be used as a complementary test uh to a pcr test so in a patient who has um uh severe disease uh their pcr could be negative if the virus has has is no longer detectable in the nasal pharynx uh and so these are people who probably have more later stage disease they've been sicker longer and it's possible that a serological test could be used to identify those individuals as having the infection because their pcr would be negative but their serological test could be positive next slide please um some limitations of the tests first you know they they don't detect the virus i think this audience understands that uh they detect antibodies against the virus uh and so they are not good tests to use in the early stages of infection and of course i'm i'm sure you appreciate that the timing of the blood collection is really important because antibodies take time to be manufactured and made by the immune system uh so it could take a week probably or longer after a person develops symptoms to make antibodies there are early serological markers or antibodies that get made first like igm or iga followed by igg so you know an igg might take you know two weeks to become positive so these aren't early markers of disease they can't be used to identify infection and of course some people uh elderly people people who are immunocompromised um they have it they have a delayed or an absent immune response and so serological testing would be sub-optimal uh you have to keep in mind that patients who are have covid disease are potentially infectious to other people early infection when a serological test will produce a negative result again it's one of the limitations um and then really importantly as these tests start to become available and used the prevalence of the of the disease of the past infection in the tested population will affect the performance of the test right so this is goes back to bayes theorem which we all learned about um if i i if i estimate right now that if i were to just randomly test a bunch of uh people in the state um if i guessed that there was a five percent prevalence so five percent of them should have been exposed as likely a high estimate then and if i used a serological test that's 95 sensitive and specific which sounds great the positive predictive value is still only 50 so a positive result is going to be wrong 50 of the time the negative predictive value is much better so a negative serological test when applied to a population of people and where the prevalence of the antibodies are low is is is reliable but a positive test is going there's going to be a lot of false positive results so keep that in mind next slide uh there are some analytical concerns which i want to share with you even though they're more focused on the laboratory as you are probably aware uh the fda there are a ton of serological tests for code b2 that have flooded the market and that's because fda relaxed their regulations allowing manufacturers to market their tests directly without going through the fda at all so they have not been reviewed that means that there are many many suspect devices of very poor quality that are now available and they many of these rapid device many of these tests are rapid devices they look like a pregnancy test right they can be done in a few minutes uh on a on a on a little plastic card and they look they certainly look like they could be done by anyone um in lab medicine parlance it's called a waived test meaning you anyone can do the test but none of them are approved none of them uh can be used that way they have to be performed in a clinical laboratory because they have not been reviewed by the fda they are considered laboratory developed tests uh that's not how they're being marketed there's a lot of deceptive marketing practices out there so if you're approached by a vendor that offers to sell you a bunch of these tests uh i would say no please do not do them they have to be validated appropriately we have to know how well the tests perform how accurate are they how sensitive are they and really importantly how specific are they analytical specificity is specificity is critical because if these devices produce a positive result due to cross-reactivity with other non-cov2 coronaviruses that's a real problem that's going to suggest there's been exposure to the disease when there hasn't been so we have to evaluate these very carefully and specifically in the laboratory before they get offered even if we get to a point where rapid tests were made available by the fda and were waived meaning anyone could do them getting data into usable databases and to the department of health would still be extremely problematic because results from cobie ii serology tests are a reportable test result to the department of health and then i have one more slide just some caveats just some points to remember so remember that molecular testing is the current test of choice for the diagnosis of acute sars-cov2 infection serological tests have no role to play in the in that in that diagnosis um and keep in mind that serological tests will miss patients in early stage of the disease when they are still infectious to other people and that's all i got so happy to take any questions thank you so much david that was a really excellent presentation and um um thank you for being brief we love that too so i just um i have one question and then i'm gonna um we'll we'll see if we the questions from the pr from the pre-registration that are based that are about the testing as well um when you uh these are just fraught with with with concern as you said they're so everyone's so excited about them and they're all in the news and everybody's talking about it but i i really appreciate that you bring up the the real limitations to the use of this testing and i'm just curious from your perspective how you think this should best be used in new mexico right you know i think initially there and even now there's still intense interest in unders in um in in wanting the these tests to identify people who are immune but we just don't know that yet so i really see there i really see a limited value uh from a clinical perspective limited value right so maybe as a compliment to a negative pcr test in a in a person who's acutely ill as a complimentary test not a replacement test and to identify people uh as convalescent plasma donors um but uh and that's really the only benefits that the utility that i see in a clinical setting from a epidemiological setting a public health perspective uh doing widespread uh testing to identify cereal prevalence uh that's not a clinical need that's a public health utilization that's where they'll have a role as well um but in the clinical setting very limited you will have patients who are going to come to you and say i want an antibody test um and that's largely going to be to uh if to satisfy a curiosity i was sick in january and i think i had covid um i wanted antibody tests to tell me well what are you going to do with the test result nothing right you're not going to use it to manage a patient who's recovered unless they want to be a convalescent plasma donor so a really limited usefulness right now of serological tests in a clinical setting nestor go ahead david excellent um i'm mr sauce an infectious disease chief here at unmh um and i and i i agree totally with your your concerns i i was actually in a meeting of idsa and they were really really concerned about the comments especially on the lay press about you know the expectation for these tests and i'm i'm especially concerned about igm igm we know from other infectious disease it's really unreliable so all that you said about the just a logical test in general it's even i think more critical if people especially providers who start to use ibm tests um because of the high number of false positives that we see so i don't know if you can comment on that because you talk about in general about serological tests but i know some of the tests that i've seen in the chinese literature actually separate igm from igg so so that's interesting thank you yes thanks for the question um right and i'm going to address this from two perspectives uh the first is you know going back to the this flood of rapid serological tests that are coming onto the market um many of them most of them uh have dual testing windows one to detect igm one to detect igg uh we have we have we are not in favor of any rapid tests at the moment there's just nothing out there that anyone has time to evaluate effectively there's no need to do rapid testing for antibodies to cov2 there's just i don't see the need for doing that uh and this is the advice that that we that tri core myself and our chief medical officer have given to uh secretaries kunkel and scrace to inform the governor so no need for rapid testing even if they offer igm we are going tricor is validating a serological test for kobe 2 antibodies but only for igg i don't see a need for the reasons you pointed out nestor about early serological markers the data i've seen again it's many of the a lot of it is still preliminary and in in pre-prints not necessarily peer-reviewed literature but it looks like the lag time between uh an igm response and an igg response for this disease is very brief uh and there are analytical comp uh uh complexities of trying to measure igm versus igg so at tripor we're investigating validating only tests for igg thank you so much that's super helpful there's a couple of chat uh questions and just comments in the chat that i'm gonna read to you and then we can move on to the the pre-reg questions so there's just a couple of um comments about positive predictive value and one that just to point out that of course if you have a high suspicion that someone's been exposed to covet 19 then the positive predictive value goes way up if you can just talk about that just for just a minute yeah yeah you know excellent point thanks um because when i was explaining it i was addressing it more from a we don't know perspective but right if someone has um you know if if the pre-test probability of uh a past coveted infection or an ongoing late covet infection is is high if that pretest probability is high then yeah you're you're already doing a test you're already applying it to a population that has a higher risk of having uh having the disease so yes your positive predictive value will certainly be better uh when the prevalence of the population you're testing is better absolutely and um you know again i mentioned in my presentation that analytical specificity was critical and it is because the positive predictive value goes up quite a bit if you utilize a highly specific test something that's 99 or you know we never want to say 100 but 99 specific then then you have very few false positive results so from a testing perspective the specificity the analytical specificity is particularly important thank you so much and then one other question then we'll go to nestor um do you know what the testing modality that vitali by talent uses to id possible convalescent plasma donors what's the question i missed that it's about the um the blood bank basically by talent and whether or not uh what tests they use to identify potential donors um right now so i am yeah i don't have i don't know for certain the way i understand it from from discussions with my transfusion medicine colleagues right now fda and the american associate association of blood banks that are developing these convalescent plasma trials aren't necessarily requiring uh laboratory evidence of serological antibodies to be a convalescent plasma donor you have to have documented that you have the infection and that you don't have a positive pcr test and it has to be so many days after you've recovered but they are collecting and banking these serum samples for prospect for retrospective serological testing and i think that's largely because the need for convalescent plasma has come more quickly than our ability to test for antibodies so those protocols could change and i could be way off base and if there's someone on this listening that has more up-to-date information i would really appreciate you chiming in thank you david i believe alan caro may know i retired bloodbath medical director down in las cruces uh i can tell you that vitality currently makes it very clear they do not test for covid either for antibodies or for the uh a pcr test they are going to be dependent solely at least initially on hospital records or prior test records from other sources to confirm that they an infection had occurred that the individual is now clinically asymptomatic at least 14 days with two negative tests or 28 days after last symptom they've made that extremely clear i hope that we will hear from the medical director of vitality specifically by the end of the week on further on this but right now there's no they have no capacity for testing there is no fda approved test to test the blood system the blood uh units for covid and that's but we're fortunate from what i understand no one i'm unaware of any case in which folks have been able to actually grow this virus out of blood or out of plasma i'm just unaware of any case so far so so so far i've not heard of any transfusion transmitted covid19 so currently that's not an issue the the key is clinical assessment for individuals who have completely recovered from an identified cova infection for potential plans with thank you thank you very much ellen um necessary um go ahead and i'm just going to ask you when you do on yourself that you can just go ahead and give if you have any updates and then we'll move into the questions that were asked in the pre-registration yeah just as a comment in one of the protocols that we are going to be doing with the convalescent plasma at unmh uh we are going to be measuring uh neutralizing antibodies because there is a there is a scientist here stephen bradford who has the the capacity to actually culture the virus and do uh plague neutralization tests so we're going to make an attempt to measure the the neutralization antibodies in the in the recipient um in the donor or the donor plasma in this case and and try to see you know what the overall behavior of these antibodies in those uh in those patients uh are and so regarding updating i just i just want to mention there have been a couple of of recent publications on the on the clinical presentation of the disease here in the united states there's an article in the new england journal that summarizes the 393 patients from new york and also the mmwr from cdc also published their experience in almost uh 1500 subjects and one of the you know most some of the different aspects of the epidemic here in the us has been the association with obesity something that was not really strongly reported from china so so patients with with overweight or obese seems to be over represented in these hospitalized databases as and also we know and we mentioned this in previous echo also the disparity regarding uh ethnicity which is also uh kind of uh interesting here in the u.s as opposed to china where there's more uh homogeneous um in the group so so those are i think my my two updates i think the the the uh lay press is making a lot of attention towards asymptomatic transmission with with what occur in the in the carrier uh when a lot of these young people are are actually testing positive and have no symptoms at the moment so i think we are appreciating more and more that this disease there is there is a sizable percentage of patients who are essentially asymptomatic and that obviously complicates issue from a public health standpoint to try to to detect people who are actually actively transmitting the disease um that's essentially i think what the what the most salient features of the last probably 48 72 hours on on the on the epidemic on my side thanks dr sosa this is joanna katzman here i work i'm a neurologist and i work closely with dr thornton at project echo um i'm just going to take over some of the questions now i just wanted to um kind of read the question from the chat dr fox mentions that as a public health practitioner he feels that the rapid serology test can be useful in contact tracing in the community where the collection of pcr samples are problematic and can give useful information to help determine who needs isolation or quarantine that's an interesting um idea and uh appreciate that i don't know if you're on the um on the line fred if you want to unmute and introduce yourself yes i'm here can you hear me yes can't you can't where are you from i'm down in silver city but you know where i practiced for many years but i'm actually the medical director for the public health department in greenlee county arizona just across the border offensively we actually have had some um rapid tests there that we've been validating in vera and doing verification are and we haven't used them in a limited sense and a limited amount for contact tracing and it was very useful however with the recent um ruling by the fda that until their these tests are given eua status that they're only high complexity we stopped testing right very interesting um dr sosa dr grenache do you want to comment on that thanks for thanks for adding to the conversation dr fox you're welcome uh yeah this is david thanks for that information um uh i guess my concern uh with the with these rapid devices and it sounds like you were able to do some validation of the of the of the device's performance i think that's that's critical you know if we have a better understanding of how these tests work then their ability to be used uh uh more uh widely uh becomes into play uh but as you mentioned you know right now uh the way they're coming to market means that they're all high complexity tests and have to be done uh in the laboratory uh so if there's ever going to be a role for rapid serological testing it's going to have to rely on a on a test that performs very well and it's hard to get really good test performance from rapid devices sometimes not all the time sometimes thanks david thanks fred um just moving on to some more questions now um this is maybe more uh difficult to answer um but dr silsa if a patient tests positive for the virus will will he or she be immune at the next uh if there be if there happens to be a next um you know a next surge perhaps we have been hearing the news that there might be a next kind of surge or next peak uh perhaps at the next season what are what are your thoughts about that yeah i think the short answer is we do not know i mean we certainly hope that a person with uh with a viral infection uh that recovers from that viral infection has some degree of protection but we with this disease we really don't know uh and and i have seen reports from from korean cdc in which they actually um commenting on patients that had already well documented coffee and are coming back several days later with uh you know positive tests again and even with sentence that seems to be related to kobe obviously this is all preliminary unpublished uh basically press communication from the korean cdc but they are facing these these uh you know finding and and make us you know doubt that that immunity it's absolute with this with this virus and and i think uh uh dr grenache commented on that that we we know that you know people produce antibodies but we don't know the meaning if those antibodies are really protective what percentage of those who are affected with kobe are actually immune and are completely protected from a second infection how long if any protection how long that protection is going to last all of those are questions that we don't really have a solid answer and and we're obviously um looking for those answers with with more more data and more stories thanks dr sosa um there's a question that came in and i think i might add to it a little bit um uh lisa tompkins asks why are we not testing immunity with frontline healthcare workers and i would just add you know we hear a lot about how do we open up you know how do we uh you know how do we open up a lot of uh you know new mexico for instance has a shelter in place as do many other states and the idea about opening things up and so not only testing immunity for health care workers but testing whether or not they might uh have uh be covet positive or just how how do you think we should go about opening up different workplaces um nestor i think it's it's that's probably the most difficult question at this point of the epidemic i mean uh and and because we have never been on this situation i think uh uh everything that i have heard our expert opinions but not really based on any any solid data um i think you know there are several facts one fact is that that because of the of the quarantine and stay at home we have not developed a society hurt immunity so there is always the risk that as soon as you relax the the social distancing measures there may be um you know sort of a new uh number of cases or increasing the number of cases especially in in certain communities or or places where people congregate so i think that the best answer that i can give that you have to have a robust um contact tracing you know testing available so so if you start to relax and i think we need to do that at some point because of the you know the economy needs to to reopen at some point we have to have have enough um you know boots on the ground to actually do um you know a good job identifying cases doing the the the epidemiological investigation i mean if we were not able to contain this epidemic when there were only 20 cases in new mexico 25 cases i remember that was a few weeks ago and we now we have many more we have to be prepared for the for the reopening because we are going to have um you know new surging cases or or new outbreaks in nursing homes and other and other places and we have to detect them early and try to take all the all the isolation measures and i think we're going to be on this intermittent um strengthening and relaxing strengthening and relaxing unless unless we we develop a vaccine or some more uh robust intervention to to to provide communities with her her immunity thanks nestor i'll ask one more question and turn it back over to carla um what what is your what is your threshold for recommending home isolation for a person who might report non-specific respiratory symptoms but perhaps hasn't yet been tested or hasn't been recommended uh you know for testing yeah i mean it depends on where the person is i think one factor is that the exposure if you are in a community where there's white widespread exposure or or or transmission i think the person needs to be tested if you have fever cough or any of the classical or even in some of the atypical symptoms like an osmia another finding that i that i that i saw in the new york uh paper was the high relatively high percentage like close to 25 percent of the patient had diarrhea and gi symptoms so so i think in a community with widespread transmission a patient who has uh an acute respiratory or an acute femoral illness with other symptoms i would try to get him tested to rule out kobe obviously if you are in a different situation in a community that you don't have any any uh transmission very few cases the patient have no exposure then you can look for us for an alternative diagnosis for his symptoms first um especially if you have limited capacity to do testing but obviously i think that the most uh radical way to find out is to do the testing do a good test during the acute phase and and this what we have the best we have is the pcr pcr testing thank you nestor just wanted to go back for a minute to the zerologic testing another question that came through the chat um is that quest now has a quest now has an antibody test available in the us commercially david do you know anything about this test and can you talk about that test in particular i don't know what what what tests specifically quest is doing but they're uh the the major uh ivd the major test manufacturers are all coming out with um serological tests uh so for uh let's see uh companies that you might have heard of roche diagnostics abbott diagnostics siemens beckmann deosorin all the all the companies that we look to to provide high quality uh tests of all sorts are now uh coming out with serological tests so uh i know that um i know that arup in salt lake city started offering a serological test largely um uh not to rest of the country again it's some things are some resource limited capacities are limited it's great to hear that quest is bringing on the test many uh there are there are a handful i think there are 13 or 14 laboratories now in the us that are that are performing serological testing and there will be more as these tests come to automated platforms that are widely available in laboratories thank you very much um okay mr uh can you just give there's a couple questions about hydrochloroquine can you just give an update on what what what is the thinking now about its use particularly in prophylaxis right i think the jury still yeah the euro is still out we haven't seen any large double line randomized control placebo trial that shows efficacy and safety i mean we haven't really seen the results of any any well-designed double-blind placebo-controlled trials so everything has been uh sort of uh open label trials uh group of of basis studies but nothing really solid so i think there's no change from what i have commented before we're still waiting for a large trial and and if you look at the literature with the limited literature that we have from china and from other france and other and other countries um there are positive studies or studies that seem to show some benefit obviously without a double blind um randomized uh design it's very hard to reach a very solid conclusion and there's some studies negative studies at wayne state university and other studies in the pre-publication phase that showed a less than ideal result and even toxicity i saw a study from brazil that shows some cardiac assisted with the use of chloroquine so i think the euro is still out we do not know if it's going to have a place either in prophylaxis early treatment late treatment we don't really really know for sure and we need those double blind placebo control studies to to to be able to to evaluate because it's very difficult i mean this is a decision that people actually get better on their own to a certain degree so if you if you give it to a you know 20 people 15 patients and they get better how do you know is the effect of the of the hydrosophy and not just the natural history of the disease it's very hard unless you have a control group very similar you know with all the characteristics and you actually have enough power to find a statistically significant difference and that has not been published yet that i know thank you thank you nestor um another question about this is not about serologic testing but about the pcr testing david or or carissa just and this has come up before if you can talk about the um the false positive and false negative rates using um pcr testing i think carissa yeah yeah i can share um so i think um the assay from a false positive rate we're really not seeing um falls positive the analytical specificity of the test um has proven to be quite strong we are seeing um i think as somebody maybe nestor mentioned that there's prolonged viral shedding that we can see in patients um after they've recovered um actually maybe it was alan who also mentioned that in some of the looking at some of the convalescent uh patients so there can be cases of prolonged viral shedding um and we see this with many other viruses i think if we did this type of a test of cure for something like influenza we would likely see that as well so i'm seeing virus present in patients after they've recovered is not uncommon for most respiratory viruses um so it doesn't mean that it's necessarily a false positive but it's just the nature of the virus and we've seen that and studies have shown that um for actually a couple of different sites seen it and nasal specimens as well as even in stool specimens some virus shedding in those specimens though possibly in most cases likely not necessarily infectious um but again it's a challenge of being able to culture those specimens because the virus does require elevated biological safety precautions a bsl3 laboratory for um for culture i think in most of those studies though when they've looked at the viability of the virus it doesn't appear to grow in culture so specificity appears to be okay sensitivity is certainly a compounded factor of both the analytical sensitivity of the test so how many viral copies can be detected um along with all of the other clinical parameters so the time from the symptoms um or sorry let's start with the time from exposure um so if you're testing asymptomatic or early symptomatic patients um there may be a lower of viral recovery as well as in the time from the symptom collection and then even post um after the symptoms uh or the disease has progressed what we are seeing um is that if you're testing an upper respiratory specimen uh later in disease course that might be negative and there may be a preference to collect a lower respiratory sample later in disease course to be able to recover the virus accurately um so i think all of these factors are really coming into play as we're looking at the clinical sensitivity of the test um and and they play a big part in that but from an analytical perspective uh we certainly are seeing that the analytical sensitivity of most of the assays are really good with less than 100 copies of the virus being able to be detected in some assays even around 50 copies of the virus detected so there's there's so many factors that come into play with the clinical sensitivity of the test but i think the biggest issue is the temporal dynamics of the virus in asymptomatic uh potentially asymptomatic carriers and then late in the disease um finally the specimen collection right so nasopharyngeal specimen collection uh versus a nasal specimen collection um uh with the best sensitivity where we're appearing to see again in the earlier disease states we're seeing better sensitivity for nasopharyngeal but still acceptable uh sensitivity for a nasal swab collection thank you very much for that thorough explanation um one other question that i don't know if there's the answer to it i'll open it up to any of you um is there any information about the sort of the volume of exposure of the virus that you need to get infected i don't know nestor's shaking his head i don't think so but yeah the question that somebody had nestor were you going to say something no that's a good great question i mean that that's one of the um we don't know really if the the severity of this is associated with the inoculum effect or or it's a genetic and that's one of the you know big questions that we have it's it's you know a matter of of the overwhelming number of virus that you get in an infection and that that translates into a more severe disease or is something else with the immune system or with some genetic uh predisposition we don't know we don't know i don't think we i have seen any any that would that that the best way to obtain that data is with experimental with the animals with an animal model and challenging the animal with different inoculants and see what the the minimal binocular necessary but i haven't seen any any publish on that yet great thank you i'm going to turn it back over to jan in just a second but there um just came a question in the chat from heather heather do you want to unmute yourself and just and ask your question heather brislen maybe or i i can ask it for her um and she can chime in if she if she's able so she she said can dr colbert please give us a general sense of what we might think of for sensitivity a number if a patient is tested in an ideal setting say three days after symptom onset i just figured out to get myself updated i'm sorry um i feel like i've read a couple passing references to a sensitivity in the range of like 70 ish but nothing that i would consider to be reliable and so um i really appreciate the insight into like it all depends on where the patient is and what time you test them and all of those things but if we just assume you know everything else being equal perfect circumstances really good testing do we have a number of what we think the sensitivity might be or is it too early to know where we're at with that so um i can actually add um maybe i can add a paper to the chat or our wonderful uh uh dated team can add a paper um that was just released in clinical infectious disease um the title of the paper is testing for stars clove two can we stop at two um and this study um looked at i think it's about seventy i'm trying to look at it now uh 72 page 70 patients sorry and they collected multiple specimens in these patients they were all around a five days post symptom onset um and i believe it was greater than eighty percent of this uh patients had the virus detected from their first clinical specimen and then another a few patients um had the virus detected in the second specimen um so it looks like again this sounds like kind of the answer to the question that you're looking for i haven't had the time to do a super deep dive on this paper but it looks like there's a fairly decent sensitivity in uh in the range that you're thinking of right that early symptom onset um for sensitivity of a molecular detection um above 80 percent it looks like 88 89 sensitivity in the first clinical specimen um and then it gets up to about like 95 um in patients who get a second swab collected during that time period so it looks like we're getting better data about the sensitivity of the assay um when we're focused on where in the symptom progression we're able to get the data perfect thank you back to you joanna sure and i uh so dr brisson and others i just wanted to let everybody know that uh our data team um and led by ken no knows where they did just put that article in the in the chat and just a reminder you're going to need to copy and paste whatever you find in the chat you're going to need to copy and paste it and put it in your own browser just for security purposes i also wanted to let um everybody know that we are collaborating with the cdc with all our covid echo programming and um they're referring clinicians to our covet echoes and we are referring them we are referring um our clinicians to their 24 7 clinician call center so that's also in the chat uh right now as you can tell in the next few minutes again we're also going to be putting in the link to our cme um as well so let me ask um start start asking a few more questions um this is uh maybe for um uh nestor um how are things going at the hospital over at unm and um what are you thinking in terms of any more projections for uh for cova 19 in new mexico when do you think the surge might um hit or and do you think we'll have a surge how it seems like we're doing pretty good in terms of flattening the curve here over yes um yeah i mean this is information that i that i heard today in one of the we have a group of like a medical advisory group for the governor and their experts there from different um fields and and uh jason mitchell specifically i think he works in press he he's been working on on these models every day and and what he mentioned today which was very encouraging is that uh you know some communities some counties in new mexico people are already in the peak and are starting to descend specifically he mentions santa fe uh and others that may be on the on the sort of the plateau of the curve um they have been able to decrease are not the transmissibility or reproductive um of the epidemic with all the social distancing very close to one which is which is the point once an epidemic falls below one or a virus transmission falls below one the epidemic starts to die because one person infects only one and there's no logarithmic or geometric growth so so overall it's it's good news he mentioned that they they are not um looking already at a statewide search but actually like more uh regionals search like the northwest new mexico et cetera as opposed to like a statewide search because they are seeing that some of the counties are actually you know starting to come down and that's really good um and that will allow at some point to to uh start opening some procedures like elective procedures in hospitals maybe some more essential businesses can be open as as soon as we have uh you know all the necessary conditions but it was really very very very positive the comment that he made in that uh mit and the medical advisory treatment group uh today so i think we overall i think the state have done a good job uh except for the the problem obviously in the northwest that it's a it's uh it's they're still going through a difficult difficult uh part in unm and press today i heard that that they are the icu's are are i got a 60 uh capacities are still there so there's a 40 availabilities of beds ventilators etc and in fact they are going to try to help the northwest uh hospitals you know offering offering to to receive some patience uh they commented that so i think overall uh you know we are doing good overall obviously we cannot uh lower our guard too early but but it's really good news that i that i really want to share with with the group in general okay joanna your mutants sorry nestor thank you so much that was an amazing uh update and uh i'm just so hopeful i can't tell you you made my day um let me ask you a couple more uh questions and i first want to just uh just uh just let uh jennifer jarrow and rapid city know that perhaps she asked several questions about um interested in hearing from the tribal epidemiology centers and how we're interfacing uh with them and um i'm not sure that we have um any experts on the line right now but it's something that actually i can look into i have a relationship with some of them with project echo and perhaps at one of our next office hours or our covert echo on friday we can uh bring someone on board so we haven't forgotten your your question um another question uh is um what is the precaution for taking immunosuppressant and the question was general general immunosuppressants uh can can they safely go out in the environment um that may be a little bit crowded and that was from alex so what are you thinking right now in terms of immunosuppressants in patients right i think with from from what we have learned of this disease there's obviously a higher uh degree of complications in patients who have underlying condition and we have we have commented on this many times obviously immunosuppressed patients transplant patients patients that take steroids or some other immunosuppression are at a high risk of having a more severe disease so i would say those group the vulnerable groups uh persons with uh you know older age or underlying conditions should be careful so to be more careful uh in general when when we reopen the the economy when when you know the risk of new outbreaks that that population have to be uh especially careful and and thinking about nursing home uh you know places where where even clinics where we see immunosuppressed like cancer centers uh or rheumatology um clinics etc they have to be extra careful not to have outbreaks or cases there because the percentage the lethality of the disease is higher on those groups so i would say those are the ones that have to remain really careful uh once the the social situation improves or the social distancing is it's it's lifted thank you um there's a question about a recommendation for um quarantine or testing for a person who's a household contact of someone who's covet uh 19 positive what would you say about how they should be separated effectively right a person who has a close contact uh and and a spouse or a household uh person that lives in the same household is considered uh you know uh an exposed person that person should be uh uh unquarantined and should it's not really isolation because it's not sick it's actually quarantined for 14 days and and symptoms should be should be sick in that in that person and obviously if symptoms develop the person needs to to be tested uh so so those are the general indication and they have that hasn't really uh changed in in the last few days the cdc have very clear recommendations and the new mexico department of health regarding that that if you're a close contact could be household or even a hospital employee or or healthcare worker if there is a close contact they need to go into quarantine and be you know isolated from the rest of the of the family etc thank you nestor um something that i wanted to let uh let participants know is that uh we have a project deco website if you type in project echo unm covid it gives us it gives you the list of our other programs uh we have another office hours just like this on wednesday from 12 to 1 and then on thursdays from 8 to 9 mountain time uh michelle harkins who's who leads our pulmonary critical care department at unm is running a a critical care echo uh which which will be in its fifth week and um it's really been identified for hospitalist inpatient clinicians those were working in the icu and then on fridays from 12 to 1 we have a more traditional covet echo with many subject matter experts like dr sosa and dr harkins and our hospital epidemiologists and folks from the new mexico department of health and and state and we have cases in that echo along with didactics and carla do you want to mention uh the presentation on friday on friday's echo yeah thank you joanna so on friday's echo we're going to have a um a brief presentation probably 15 or 20 minutes from the the team at unm who's doing the um ppe work so there's a really really strong team there and uh laura shelby who's one of our iid colleagues is going to do the presentation but they'll i think five or six of them are going to be on so it's it'll be really interesting because i know there's been there have just been a ton of questions about ppe so we look forward to having that group that group come on on friday the other thing i wanted oh go ahead johanna oh no i just want to also mention one more one more echo um that's on mondays actually an hour after this echo ends and that's our uh first responder resiliency echo and that's really for all frontline clinicians um to help with kind of the um mental health aspects of and the stress involved with being on the front lines of this cove pandemic thanks carla back to you sure no problem so david i wanted to ask you if um we're at the end now if you could just talk a little bit about the the other things that you had in your email so the serologic testing fact sheet and also the the press the um the announcement from the fda the press release we did put that into the chat as well but if you wanna if you can talk about that really quickly yeah no there was just some resources that fda pushed out over the weekend that i thought was interesting um uh they are doing a study um with i think nih and um to evap to do a a systematic evaluation of the clinical and analytical performance of these various serological tests that might take some of the burden off laboratories who are trying to consider which one if any to use because then they could be more selective and not just toss darts um and uh and there's just general some good good guidance uh and information that i just i wanted to make people aware of uh as they uh as like all of us as we start to sort of unravel this serological testing onion and what it all means thank you so much so that for those of you who are interested that was just put back into the chat um so that we can uh you can go to that press release as well um and david did you have any last um comments or anything that you'd like to share with the group um no i well i have a request um you know a tricor is going to start offering a serological igg test uh soon i don't have an exact date i hate to give i need to be held to something but probably uh early may and i would just ask that um you know that clinicians use it judiciously as we talked about earlier we still don't really know the best way to use these serological tests um patients will want it uh to understand if they're immune or not but as we've discussed repeatedly we don't know if these test results indicate immunity so uh if the if when the test becomes available just uh please help us use it judiciously we have a set allocation of reagent to use and um i don't want to uh i want to make sure we try to use it appropriately we're putting together a sort of a prioritization type of document to help clinicians identify priority uses of these tests uh which we would hope to have available uh when we launched the test excellent so we will have maybe if you can we'll have you come back when that prioritization document is actually ready and you can talk about that that would be super helpful for this group i think sure that sounds great so um just another reminder that the cme um link for the chat is in the chat box multiple times now so you can just copy that and put it into your browser and and receive cme for um these these sessions and i think we have we are done with the questions pretty much so we're we'll give you oh nestor has something to say go ahead nestor yeah it's not a question i just want to i received um an email informing me that the nih had actually created an open research data set uh it's it's called c-o-r-d so kobe 19 open research data set um and this court 19 it's uh it sort of compiles all the all the order publications uh both in the in the you know in the regular literature but also in the pre-publication phase and any and and using uh artificial intelligence that you're able to do search uh for words it's sort of a almost like a google search but specifically for for publications or pre-publications it's very useful uh for code related uh issues so you can you can look for cord 19 from the nih and and you'll find the the web page or or maybe they're like writer and has time to to put it up but it's it's very useful and you can do searches and and of unpublished papers it's even better than pubmed in that in that thank you so much nestor so we will um hopefully see some of you later this week or next monday with our office hours and thank you again to david nestor and um chris for all of your expert advice we'll see you next week or see you sometime this week baby bye-bye thank you very much,,4/20/2020
2,hey yes welcome to our office hours our office hours with the infectious disease uh program at unm with dr nester sosa i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i work at project echo and i've been co-facilitating this session with my colleague dr carla thornton who's also an infectious disease uh specialist it's so nice to have everybody on here on the on the network many of you are from new mexico and we have a some participants from outside of new mexico and that's fantastic as well what i'd like to do is make a few announcements and then introduce dr sosa to see if he wants to give us a an update um regarding what's going on regarding covet 19. so at project echo we're really all about building a community and really it helps if everybody's video camera is turned on so if you're if your camera's not turned on yet please go ahead and if you have one turn it on so we can see your faces and um it's really a much better way in an altitude i'll learn capacity to uh to to have an echo echo session we'll also try our best to address all your questions submitted through the registration and chat and feel free to chat in your questions uh we will try to get to all the questions today i think that won't be a problem uh and then please register for a future session and submit those questions again i also wanted to ask you to please refrain from responding to questions directed at the hub team unless called on just because there are so many of you it's not typical of our normal tele echo sessions but in light of just the demand of this program we're hoping to unmute many of you but please allow us to do that if we can also our digital librarian kent noseworthy he's really been spot on with providing kind of a lot of the journal articles and all a lot of the evidence base or it might not be evidence-based uh you know today what was we thought was best practices yesterday but um whatever you know what what we're talking about what dr sosa brings up kent noseworthy our librarian will be putting in the chat just remember that you need to copy and paste whatever is in the chat into your browser in order to get that information it's because of zoom security that we can't put in a hyperlink finally we have a collaboration with the cdc and they they do for the last 10 days now they've had a 24-hour clinical hotline for clinicians to be able to call them if they have urgent questions and likewise they're referring a clinicians to our covet echoes as well at about 45 minutes after the hour you should also be getting a cme link um in the chat and again you'll have to copy and paste that and put that in your browser to obtain your cme or ceu credits so with that i'd like to open it up to dr sosa for you know any updates or uh brief and what's going on in in the infectious disease world with covid19 thank you very much uh joanna and thank you for all the participants we we see always a lot of people here uh i really appreciate the questions and the interaction it's really stimulating um there are a couple of of like uh issues that are in the news one it's a recently published uh study out of the va out of the veteran administration this is uh probably the largest story using hydroxychloroquine um it uh comprises around 368 patients and they they actually did a retrospective review of their treatment there were three arms in this study one arm was hydroxychloroquine another arm with hydroxychloroquine uh citromycin and a third arm without hydraulic chloroquine and the surprising finding was that those who receive hydroxychloroquine had a higher risk of death 2.6 times the risk of death compared with those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine so this study is actually circulating in the news media because although it's not it's not a randomized double line placebo control study there may be some uh selection bias uh meaning that maybe they gave the hydrology into more severe patients but undoubtedly it's of some concern the fact that the patients who received the hydrochloroquine were you know more than two times higher high risk of dying compared with those who did not so so we you know we're still eagerly awaiting for that robust double-blind placebo control study that shows efficacy but in in my view a negative study like this really questions the routine use of hydroxychloroquine and and and should probably make us think um in that you know all of those hydrochloroquine that are in routine um you know treatment plants or or therapeutic schemes for for kobe 19 maybe need to be revised uh in view of this story i mean it's it's hard to change policy with just one saudi but it's it's it's a pretty uh relatively large story and it's done throughout the united investigator a states site it's actually all the ba the you know the limitation obviously this story was done mostly in males or almost almost exclusively in males so it wasn't applied to and and the the median age was 65 so probably no you cannot extrapolate it to to the general population but it's it's nevertheless uh concerning uh we have already uh in new mexico over 2000 cases 2072 the last uh count and more than 40 000 uh tests have been done according to the new mexico department of health so so we uh unfortunately went over the 2000 mark that was something that we were getting closer every day um in that so those are my two you know general comments at the beginning and glad to take questions now thanks uh thanks so much nestor um can you remark on how patients are doing um at unm hospital in terms of the uh in the icu or is is any any changes regarding um uh viral um any any changes regarding treatments or um any changes in what you're doing in terms of management no as of today we're still running the hydroxychloroquine acetomycin uh acetomycin study i actually uh communicated with the other principal investigator dr michelle harkins uh to to actually discuss the the results of this va study and and if that should inform any any decision regarding you know modifying the enrollment or or halting the the enrollment for the time being that needs to be discussed with the irb uh but but no we haven't really make any changes there have been um a few patients that have receiver industry beer on a compassionate uh basis we're still waiting to enter one of the large uh multi-center studies uh of foreign and we have uh a couple of companies and plasma studies approved and and we need still to get the donors and and get uh you know the blood bank and vital and to actually provide the the convalescent plasma donor but we are moving in that direction uh to to have that that uh treatment available not only here but you know in other uh centers here in albuquerque like press and offline are also working towards towards you know having this convalescent plasma available for for the patient that we are going to enter in the stories thank you nestor um i wanted to let the group that i'm trying to bring uh dr elizabeth rosenbaum on to one of our sessions and i think it might be one uh one of the friday covet echo sessions to talk about uh convalescent uh plasma um and how clinicians can get their patients to uh possibly be donors and how it works and things like that so i will let um the email list all the clinicians know when that is forthcoming um i think with that i wanted to start with um a couple of questions and then turn it over to carla if that's okay um pamela from albuquerque yes has asked a couple of questions and this is again related to uh studies and treatment uh she asked are tetracyclines being studied for their antiviral effects on covid19 um and um can you update us on any um other antiviral uh drugs that may be effective you've mentioned remdi severe but are there others so i guess the first is about tetracyclines and the second is about other antivirals in addition to remdi severe listen um i mean i've read uh in one of the papers that sort of a review of molecules that are active against coping there was some mention of tetracycline tetracyclines are really broad spectrum antibiotics they actually can be used in bacterial infection but they also have some activity against even parasitic infection we use doxycycline for instance for malaria prophylaxis so uh it's an inhibitor of the protein synthesis of the cells so in theory it can have some effect on on some of the some of the processes of the viral processes within the cell but i haven't seen any any study i i have to check in clinical trial.gov to see if there's a clinical scholarly plan with doxycycline and i'm not aware of any um but i again i wouldn't be surprised because this is such a broad spectrum protein inhibit protein synthesis inhibitor that that it may it may have shown in vitro activity against some some other viruses regarding other antiviral yeah there are a couple of direct antivirals besides the rendezvous there's a molecule called favipira beer and another one called arbidol orbital inhibits the union of the virus to the cell the the initial phase of the of the infection of the cell and has been studied in a very limited number of patients in in southeast asia against kobe 19 um obviously no we don't have any large you know double blind comparative strategies open label and and the same with fabi piravir uh there is also an antiviral it inhibits the the rna polymerase so it's a it acts in the same uh molecule that they're in decibel does so it's a direct acting antibiotic and there is some human experience with this uh treatment and again promising but nothing of good quality you know double-blind comparatives trial those are two of the two of the i think antivirus that have been already tested there is there is there is a paper um that was actually pre-published a couple of weeks ago but i saw it published um yesterday um about the use of hybermectin hybrimectin is an antiparasitic drug and and some researchers in australia actually demonstrated um a pretty strong inhibition of the virus in vitro this is in in viral cells in in in the lab uh the problem with hypermectin is that that in order to get the levels that that were achieved in that experiment um we would need to use a very high dose of ivermectin uh in the clinical patients and we haven't really done any clinical studies on that anti-parasitic drug and there's also another uh antiparasitic called nita soxami which also has some in vitro activity in fact i review in clinicaltrials.gov there are over 600 clinical trials uh related to kobe 19 so in a period of just three months there have been six over 600 um clinical trials registered in clinicaltrial.gov evaluating some type of intervention not only pharmacological but other non-pharmacological intervention to try to uh improve uh patients with kobe 19 so it's really interesting and and you know within the next month we're gonna start seeing uh you know the implementation of those trials and at some point we'll see the publication and see what works and what doesn't work thanks so much nestor for that great explanation um just wanted to turn it over now to carla thornton uh my close colleague and other and your close colleague too an infectious disease specialist at unm she's going to co-facilitate some questions now carla yeah thank you joanna um i just wanted to start by asking heather brislen heather i know you're on i don't see you on my screen but um you had a particular question and said that you could explain it a little bit better so if you want to ask your question can you hear me okay yeah just introduce yourself and say where you're from okay great i um i'm trying a new microphone today so i just wanted to be sure my name is heather brislen i'm in internal medicine private practice here in albuquerque and i'm helping out with the city's eoc group working on homeless patient well homeless residents and planning for covet here so my questions related to that and dr sosa i'm sorry to put you in the hot seat for a question that i think probably doesn't have a real clear-cut answer um but i remember a week or so ago you showed us a picture maybe on this same webinar of your little ear loop surgical mask that you were letting sit in the sunshine on your in your office so this question is about ppe and reuse issues um what we have right now is a separation of the elderly and medically fragile homeless residents in albuquerque into a number of community centers and we're rolling out community health workers or other social supports to help them sort of shelter in place a little better because that's a mobile population and that group of residents has a lot of needs for the people that are going to be spending time in those community centers with that population of people they've asked what kind of ppe they should wear i'm not sure there's a clear indication that they need any except maybe the fabric masks as we've talked about city-wide just for preventing asymptomatic you know transmission when possible um but the other question is they have a very small number of the paper type surgical ear loop masks can those be reused for as long as a week we don't have enough to just let the staff or the residents use a new paper type mask every single day so i i know that's a long question my thought is to probably tell them to use the paper mask carefully you know maybe let it sit in the sun or something like that in between uses for as long as a week or preferably probably a reusable fabric mask that can be washed and i would just like to know your thoughts and if i should be thinking along some other lines for that excellent excellent questions and obviously i mean there's i have no evidence to support what i'm going to say uh but you know what one issue with the with the surgical mask with the the double ear these are very fragile i mean in fact i i doubt that it will be able to use it for a whole week i use mine for a day and at the end of the day it's either you know tear or or the elastic it's already very relaxed uh so so it's it's very hard to use it for for more than a day here at unm we're giving a mask in in the morning and we use it all day but really it's very hard to to have it for you know longer than a couple of days like because they do break when you take it off and and and they become really you know soiled with saliva or or with you know if the person uses lipsticks or any any other thing it becomes really impractical to use it for a long for a long period of time but it makes sense at least to use it for a day if you can use it for a couple of days it will make sense just you know if you're dealing with patients potentially infected patient even if they are asymptomatic uh the problem is the extra exterior part of the mask the you know the the people do not touch that part and they actually put it on and off without touching the front because then you're basically defeating part of the purpose of the of the mask um and obviously cloth masks especially to protect other people from your infection it makes sense and and they are easy to wash and and to clean and disinfect with just a regular soap but but it is a problem to reuse the the mask i can show you mine is already broken the one that i used last week didn't last i mean for a couple of days and it's already uh damaged because of of overuse thank you thank you heather thank you minister for that answer there's a couple of questions esther about um about testing and one of them is as the drive-through sites are doing only nasal not nasopharyngeal swabs is this an approved way to collect specimens can you talk about those two different um right yeah there is um i mean i'm not aware of what methodology they're using in the dry troops because i'm not really uh on top of that but um i asked this to uh karissa culbreth and other experts on on testing and you know the testing that they're using for nasal uh has a pretty decent uh sensitivity it's probably not equal to nasopharyngeal but from a public health uh standpoint um because of the methodology is sensitive it's a pcr-based methodology you can use nasal the advantage the great advantage of nasal is that you don't need that much protection it doesn't generate the risk of you know coughing and aerosols so you save ppe so that it's a trade-off i mean the decrease in the sensitivity that you may experience um it's probably compensated by the fact that it's easier to do it's less than comfortable and when we move to up to a you know to a situation in which we're going to do a lot of testing you know it's probably going to be easier to do nasal and there's even an fda-approved nasal self-testing for for patients so i think it's it's going to be the way of the future maybe with a slight decrease in the sensitivity because you know you're you're testing uh it's not it's not as deep as the nasopharyngeal but it's it's a viable alternative especially taking into consideration the issues with the with saving ppe's and and and uh not exposing people to aerosols and coughing that can occur when you're trying to take a very deep nasopharyngent sample thank you mister um there's a couple of questions too about when you can deem somebody non-infectious and i don't know if you just want to go through that and what this sort of testing algorithm is for people who have tested positive right the cdc has published already a clear guidance on these and there are two two uh ways to approach it one is it's it's doing testing and and and it's what we use sometimes in the hospital it's actually getting two negative tests two negative pcr tests separately about 24 hours so so once you have a person who have you know repeatedly tested negative you consider that person non-infectious if you don't have the luxury or or their limitation with the testing the other approach is basically a symptom-based approach you can and the cdc recommends that if a person is a federal for 72 hours so three days in february and has an improvement of the respiratory symptoms and they are beyond seven days of the initiation of the disease they are considered for all practical purposes non-infectious so you can either use those one of those two approaches the test based approach or the symptoms based approach thank you very much and just a couple of other questions just if there's any update or you don't have any new information on the whether or not people who have uh antibody are immune to the disease right yeah it's still completely unknown and and in fact over the last few days we there was a communication for the korean cdc in which they reported 163 patients who already had copied in the past more than two weeks before and they actually came back with positive tests so they have been clear as as you know recover patients but they actually uh again after uh two weeks of of being recovered they they were they were able to detect rna of the virus and some of these patients had also symptoms so have mild symptoms um interestingly enough no none of them were able to infect other peoples around them but there was evidence of vital shedding you know longer or after a clinical recovery so that that is it's putting into question the the how strong the immunity is if it's not a sterilizing immunity what type of protection is really confirmed by the antibodies i mean there's no doubt that people produce antibodies because they have been measuring specific antibodies but the question now is the are the antibodies really protected do we have an immunity and if there's immunity for how long that immunity protects patients who have recovered there's still a lot of uncertainty there thank you very much i'm going to turn it back over to joanna great um i'm wondering if um a josie van vanderwaal uh vanderwagen is on is um in the on the line right now from sunland park um josie are you are you on the call okay uh josie are you able to unmute can you hear me yes yes i just wanted to know if you might want to ask your question it's always nice to be able to have that if we have some extra time to get some folks to be able to mute and have more of a typical bi-directional echo session do you want to ask your question or i can remind you what it was about or you probably know well the one from today was um can they use nasal spray and still get tested did you hear that nestor and you also you also had one from when you registered and i can also read that out to you as well but i think the first one nestor josie said is can you be using nasal spray different nasal sprays and still get tested accurately um i i'm not sure i understand i mean nasal spray like like uh for for rhinitis or or what type of nasal sprays just sailing normal it was for allergies okay yeah i mean i i don't think i have seen any specific publication to that regard um so i i cannot really tell you for sure but i i mean my guess is that that probably a nasal spray will not uh eliminate the virus from from the cells that are infecting you know the respiratory epithelium so in theory it should be should be okay but i haven't really seen any any publication to that regard it would be interesting to see if the sensitivity decreases uh at all with with uh or changes at all with with nasal spray i don't know um and i i think that um kent our librarian just put some guidelines in the chat that we can we can look up to after this session um also uh josie you put in a chat um a question uh you had asked um uh asymptomatic patients with cova 19 are contagious self-isolated re-test in 14 days what if you are still positive after that um do you want to remark on that nestor yes um first of all i mean we don't know for sure if rna presence equals uh infectiousness uh remember this this pcr test detect uh just that portion of the of the virus the rna and not necessarily uh complete infectious virus we know from other diseases um in which we we can um we that we treat successfully like tuberculosis that you can find the find the uh the dna of the of the bacteria for a long period of time even after successful treatment and after uh rendering the person non-infectious so we don't know really for sure if a person who let's say three weeks out it's still excreting rna of the virus if he's infectious or not and that's something that epidemiological studies will be able to answer is very hard to culture the virus uh from respiratory secretion once the concentration goes below a million buyers um but but it's it's still an open question we don't know i mean we are using that as a surrogate market for infectiousness and in fact in the cdc recommendation of the two negative tests we assume that positive pcr means still after transmission but we don't know and and if i have to guess i mean after you have a recovered from the disease and a febrile and no cough you're probably less infectious that at the beginning of the disease when the concentration of virus is really very high um in the respiratory secretion but it's it's there's no clear-cut uh or sure answer to that question joanna i think you're muted still oh thank you thank you nestor and thank you josie for coming on to the call um a couple questions from uh james uh reynolds and bethesda um but ask some kind of more new mexico specific questions or interested in what what mitigation um is being done in rural new mexico to i think i believe the question is really to decrease the community spread in rural and rural sites are you able to answer answer a bit of that no i'm a city boy unfortunately i've been only here in albuquerque especially with this outbreak i haven't been able to go around so i don't know if there any any anybody else in the chat that can actually give a more qualified answer hey joanna eugene marciniak from the department of health is actually on i don't know eugene if you could unmute yourself and introduce yourself and then possibly just address that question if you know that would be great eugene oh if you can hear me um yeah i know we don't know why at this point particularly in southern new mexico we've had fewer cases in the rural in there some of our more rural counties including otero county and luna county and pretty much uh all of our counties south of uh you know south of albuquerque and socorro um so it's just pretty much the same things we're doing around the state just with social distancing and you know pretty much all the stores and everything are still shut down eugene can you just enter tell everyone who you are oh i'm sorry i'm the i'm one of the health officers from the department of health and based in las cruces dr marciniak very interesting um thank you for all the work you're doing you helped uh you helped us very much with a situation in alamogordo when we when new mexico lost a primary care provider who was doing a lot of addiction work a couple of months ago so thank you on that too can you um and someone just catherine torres um just wrote that the navajo nation has gone to 57 hour curfew on the weekends and i believe that started last week um and has a nightly curfew from eight to five which brings me to another question that we had from james also um which is what mitigation strategies are being done for the pueblos and the navajo nation and perhaps dr marciniak you might be able to um answer that a little bit i think you're muted okay uh unfortunately you know i work mostly in southern new mexico and we only have two uh reservations in our area but i know what we're doing currently is just doing we're constantly testing uh you know the particularly in the four corners region on the navajo reservations we've we've just really increased the amount of testing we're done and then contact tracing while you're still on i mean while you're still while you're talking do you want to just um talk about what you said in the chat about the antibody testing that your that your health office is going to start doing oh it's actually not our health office it's uh our state lab is working on validating i believe they're validating an antibody test but i think the antibody test is only igg and i was my question for dr sosa was is igg testing alone a good test for possible immunity or or is there some benefit to doing igm and igg testing yes thank you thank you for the question uh well for first of all i mean the immune response what we know which is not a lot uh the immune response to this virus usually the production of igm and igg is very close uh in time so there's not like a large separation between igm production and igg production so so probably um igg will be as good as igm igg combined testing because of that you know it's a few days that the igm is produced and then the igg starts to go up there's also an issue with igm igm in general i'm not talking about any specific testing but igm in general is less reliable there's more false positive than igg igg tends to be more specific more better affinity for the antigens so i i'm actually glad that that new mexico it's it's validating um igg as opposed to just a broad igg igm type of testing because of those considerations um and i think um it can use i mean it can be used we don't know still if it's a measure of immunity as i said uh before it's very hard to to know if the simple presence of antibody correlates with with complete immunity so i think until we know that we're not going to be able to to um to say that a person with antibodies is protected uh from the disease or it's it's not going to be uh infected we don't know that you know we assume because it's what what is the common uh occurrence with many viral infections that if you have antibodies you are protected but with these virus i'm afraid we cannot generalize and we still need more information on correlation between presence of antibody and actual protective immunity but it definitely can be used for like cereal prevalence stories because people who develop specific antibodies were probably infected even if they're not immune at least they were exposed and produce antibodies so so it can be helpful in that and maybe there is a clinical situation in which um a person has already cleared the viral setting and and still has symptoms suggestive of of kobe and you can probably use an igg sort of an indirect marking for for infection i mean it's not as good as having a positive pcr uh but it will tell you that that person have the clinic at the right clinical setting high sus high clinical suspicion high pre-test probability of coping and they they have negative pcr but a positive igg you can you can make an argument that that's probably copied in fact um that would be the other situation besides the serotonin studies uh in population it would be uh as a help or as a complement of the pcr testing but i don't know if we can use it as a as a surrogate to to immunity because we still don't know thank you for that explanation nestor very helpful i'm i'm wondering uh eugene i'm wondering dr racine if i could just uh bother you for one more kind of question explanation you probably didn't think you were gonna be uh get to be a panelist today could i bother you for that um oh sure could you know could you just uh tell us or teach us a little bit about um how you're doing the contact tracing um in in new mexico and you know it really does seem like it's why new mexico's really just doing um really kind of on top of the really really on top of the country in in terms of how we're getting to cases and uh figuring it out and really um perhaps might not really even surge um in any way at least i'm a i'm just a infinite optimist but can you just kind of explain the the protocol of what happens it might be helpful for everyone to hear just in a minute a few minutes um you know i can tell you what i what i know i mean when the pandemic first started and you know we first started getting cases in new mexico you know we have we have a team of epidemiologists led by dr chad smelser that and it's it's not a small number even to start with i think there was at least between 30 and 60 epidemiologists that were actually doing almost all the contact tracing as the number of cases have you know each case probably generates anywhere from five to ten you know other contacts each confirmed case of covet 19. so as you know as we get now we're up to at least uh over 2 000 cases and so we're starting to have all of our staff around the state that works with the department of health specifically the public health division and so we've so more recently like in our region and the the southeast region we have we have teams of std investigators we call them disease investigators dis staff and they have experience calling people constantly related to std contact investigations specifically more syphilis gonorrhea and chlamydia less often um so they're used to calling people and they're used to talking to them and and it's it's actually harder because they ask questions about you know sexual contacts and things and this is this is going to be a little easier because the people that get tested have an interest in in protecting the people that they have contact with which is usually family members and co-workers and friends so we as as the as the numbers of in new mexico have spread the number of staff that are currently being trained has increased and so we're we're starting with you know what you said our std investigators have already started doing in our region and the other the other regions in addition to the the epidemiology staff in santa fe and we're also training we have a lot of nurses trained and in fact this coming week we have a number of nurses in our region that are going to be assigned the case contact investigation tracings so we're just expanding out as as we get more cases i'm sorry i i didn't explain how it was done i mean there we actually have this texting program that if the if the patients are willing and the contacts are willing to sign up for it that it's actually an automated program where they get a text message every day and then they respond to the text messages but otherwise they get a call every day and they ask them for symptoms if they develop symptoms we tell them where they can go to get tested around the state and then if they if somebody gets tested and there's a new case then that contact investigation spreads out from there thank you so much um sarah davis did you have a question no i was actually just going to add on to what dr marciniak said um so i am also additionally helping to uh lead a team out of unm emerging infectious program that has dealt with um training medical and advanced nursing students to do the contact facing they've been so fantastic in being a part of the contact tracing and helping unm emerging infection program staff to alleviate some of the burden on the disease investigation unit um like dr marciniak said as the case counts increase the burden obviously grows so we're trying to train as many people as possible to um be a part of the surge capacity um i believe there's been a lot of questions about tribal lands and i believe that um department of health is partnering with the navajo nation as well well as the albuquerque albuquerque area aztec i forget what exactly it stands for um led by kevin english that's helping to do a lot of the contact racing in a culturally sensitive manner on rival plans thank you that's that's exactly right yeah kevin english with aztec thanks sarah so much back to you carla thank you joanna sarah do you mind just introducing yourself and where you're where you're from yeah sorry so i'm sarah from davis um i worked at department of health up until about four weeks ago and five weeks ago um i started at unm the day that the pandemic was declared so um have been leading a team in sort of a newfound capacity there perfect thank you so much okay i'm just gonna nestor there's a couple of clinic questions about clinical manifestations which i i think are very interesting and wendy johnson who's on the call so she can speak up if she has other if she has other questions besides these but was wondering if you could speak to the specifically about the um the ideology or the um of the early hypoxia without significant dyspnea that and the possibility of close home monitoring of oxygen saturations on patients to to get them support earlier when they need it yeah that have been an observation in several of the um you know publications and and uh in in this case one of the things that can be useful is the use of a pulse oximeter and i know there are some health system that that bought enough pulse oximeters to monitor their patient and they actually when when a patient visits one of the facility they giving a pulse oximeter to monitor and then uh through telehealth you can actually get the results or the the levels of oxygenation on the patient but it's obviously you know a costly uh procedure you have to have the equipment the person needs to retrain how to use it and then there's got to be some evaluation by healthcare workers on the other end about those those um results thank you and can you um also speak to the other non-respiratory manifestations of the disease specifically neurological and renal and then there was also a pre-registration question while you're talking about this about dermatologic manifestations right it's just so first i'll recap i mean the the in most of the case series the respiratory symptoms are the more the more frequent you know cough fever shortness of breath and then non-specific general symptoms like malaise fatigue uh decreasing appetite are things that we are we are seeing initially uh in most of the reports more recently there have been interest obviously in the lack of sense of smells or loss of sense of smell and taste uh which which it's been going up i mean the first few reports from italy uh they were those symptoms were present in around 30 percent but now using more sensitive formal smell testing i have seen publication that it goes as high as 80 percent of the patients may have it so so it depends i think if you don't ask at all you probably don't detect that symptom if you ask it you can find it in 30 40 and if you test with sensitive smell uh testing uh you can detect it in more patients so it's a pretty uh i mean it's pretty amazing that that's such a um relatively rare symptom it's it's so so prevalent and then in patients who develop severe disease we are seeing several organs besides the lungs we are seeing uh cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysfunction which we don't know if it's just part of the whole sepsis sepsis or cytokine storm or there's a specific invasion of the virus of the heart we are seeing more reports also of uh acute kidney injury and a sizeable percentage of patients in icu require renal replacement therapy so it's it's a it's a well-known fact that the the kidney is another of the organs affected by the by the infection and the inflammation associated with this virus and also uh there are some neurologic findings and and i have seen reports of encephalitis with this virus in kids i have seen reports of meningitis and meningitis so there is i mean it's not all the patient it's a small percentage of patients but there there is evidence of of central nervous system uh component to the disease and finally uh in the in the literature there have been reports of dermatological uh manifestation again it's not that frequent but there is like a macular popular rust that have been associated in some patients uh that looks almost like a viral xanthum like like missiles or or some of the most common viral examples there's also this call the so-called acro ischemia in which patients develop discoloration of the toes almost like frostbite type of lesion probably from small embolic phenomenon in the toes that have been described in children more than adults but have been described also in adult in adult patients so yeah so we are you know we're seeing we're learning a lot of uh of this new manifestation of the disease becomes more widespread there are more clinical reports on different uh organ system being affected uh and i think we're gonna see we're gonna see more of that including rare reactions uh i have seen a couple of reports of the ambare which hasn't really make that much not much noise but there is it's something that we see with our viral infection so like a post-infectious neuropathy it's also been reported thank you that was great great explanation um one other i just wanted to uh to ask catherine torres if you have if you have a microphone if you can unmute yourself and introduce yourself you've put a lot of really interesting um things into the chat about what's going on the navajo nation in terms of mitigation can you do you have a microphone catherine oh can you hear me now yeah okay um my name is dr catherine taurus and i now work up on the navajo nation um in a non-profit clinic so i'm out but saint michaels and basically they've gone to curfew which was in the evening but people were spending way too much time going into gallup and when they got their stimulus checks you know people needed to get food and tires and batteries and things to stock up because they're being told that the peak is july first so the people who live in the community are very you know unclear nervous um and very scared because the press is saying one thing and they're hearing other things so it's very confusing um so when they went to the weekend curfew um the fine was is a thousand dollars if you're out and you're non-essential so there were probably a hundred people that got fined the first weekend last weekend um the national guard came in to gallop so because people were not i guess observing the six feet and they were still bringing all the family and the kids so now they're stationed at grocery stores and at walmart and gallop is starting to find people if they're bringing kids and then yesterday the navajo nation went to we have to wear masks everywhere when we're out so our clinic actually um there's some seamstresses out in western navajo nation and up in the northern part who have been making cloth mass and our clinic bought um probably 150 and every time a patient comes in we give them that to wear and then they can wash it at home and use it and they've donated stuff also the albuquerque chinese american asian family center donated mass at about 160 so people have been donating mass into the navajo nation which we greatly appreciate um because it's it's a little hard when you have federal and states and county all together on one land so and then because i'm in apache county they've started letting people know what isolation orders are because that was very confusing to the community what did it mean to to stay home and if you're out or you see someone who's out who's infected so they've been doing a lot of work on educating um the community but we really do need um mass i think um to be able to give to the community to you so any donations are welcomed um either through the navajo nation or through any of the other community programs that are up here so um i just wanted to let you all know that thank you so much catherine for that that's great information thank you for for talking to us about that um welcome there is another question that came in i'm gonna actually ask craig from correct him to me craig would you be willing to unmute yourself and introduce yourself and ask your question uh yes i'd be happy to thank you um my name is craig tim and i'm on the faculty of the medical school in cardiology and also very much involved in the medical education programs right now and my question uh has to do with milder cardiac involvement in patients that don't have cardiovascular or respiratory collapse are you seeing examples of mild myocarditis mild pericarditis and similar things for example with elevations of troponin that aren't very high or bnp or things like that no unfortunately i haven't seen uh any any report to that regard and and to be honest most of the reports that i have read and that have been published uh they have been about severe hospitalized cases they're sort of a of a you know bias towards polishing the series of the large hospitals in china italy spain but very few on the on the findings on outpatients or patients with mild disease so i cannot i cannot opine on on that subject and i think it's a very interesting question we don't we don't know really those patients with mild diseases what type of of uh organ involvement they have because we i haven't seen any any uh publication regarding that but thank you for the question thank you thank you craig back to you joanna okay yeah this is joanna here yeah thank you craig too good to see you um i have a ques i'm wondering if um james a wilterdeen is on the call still he had a a question from one of the pre-registration questions that might be interesting if he's available to unmute yeah hi i'm here thanks james um would you be able to introduce yourself oh can you hear me okay yes uh would you be able to introduce yourself to the group first i'm james wilton i'm a family physician at the unm student health service and a couple of our clinicians have been watching the drive the drive in testing sites in albuquerque and feel like that the quality of specimen obtained there is not adequate and that was my question about it appeared that they're barely getting getting into the nair to get a specimen and we we had been thinking that they were really supposed to be getting nasopharyngeal swabs so we're really concerned that there's going to be a lot of false negatives from from those drive-in centers and we're wondering if anybody is coordinating training for those individuals or anything like that dr sosa do you want to answer that or perhaps even dr marciniak might have any information on that as well thanks james right i mean i'm not very familiar with the process and the training of the drive-through uh testing centers i i can say that including from previous discussion we have had here in the echo that there is a there is a swap for nasal which is a shorter swat swap and there's another one for next so far yield so i'm wondering if they're using the the this uh nasal swap as opposed to the software and the other drive-through in which case it's supposed to be uh used that way so that it shouldn't compromise too much the sensitivity but i don't know if they're using the longer that is supposed to be nasopharyngeal and and taking just from the nerves so i i don't really know i don't know if um somebody else can can say something about it yeah i can just go ahead and comment with our department of health drive-by uh collections it's all done by nasopharyngeal swabs um all of our nurses are trained you know we we have we have we have some nurses that have been doing nasopharyngeal swabs for other reasons for for years and so they've been training our nurses but what happens at some of these events there's volunteers there's even mrc volunteers local volunteers from other clinics and so our more experienced nurses are supposed to be training them i'm not sure what event the doctor was referring to just a minute ago but if it were our department of health nurses doing it they should have been doing the bilateral full nasopharyngeal swap collections but i do agree i think it is a problem because i've been to some events and i've talked to you know that i some some of our nurses that some of the nurses i've observed it's mostly nurses um you know don't don't go as long as as deep as some of the nurses that are trained you know with our own department health nurses thank you gene i just this is carla i just wanted to point out too um fred fox are you still are you on because you put in something in the chat early on in the discussion about this what the cdc um is recommending can you if you can if you can meet yourself and introduce yourself that would be great yeah my i'm fred cox i'm a partially retired family doc i still do public health um for greenlee county in arizona cdc the cdc released a lab um communication on the 20th and clarifying um in which they reference clarifying the correct collection techniques and that's been put on the chat but the digital library librarian um but basically it says i'm trying to pull it up well it basically says the preferred um method is the deep nasopharyngeal swab and at the only acceptable time to use the anterior nerves or the mid turbinate is for as a second choice is in symptomatic patients and that's outlined in that reference that the digital librarian put on thank you so much fred and i would just say that you know we um we'll try to get the tr our tri-core people back on the call on monday and maybe somebody else uh uh marla or some one of the epidemiologists from the from doh and we can just see if we can get some clarity on that thank you back to you jonah sure um thanks carla i just wanted to before we move on to maybe one or two last questions i wanted to remind everybody i think um if there hasn't been one cme um announcement yet in the chat there there will be and there's probably going to be another one right now probably from elena martinez so be sure to get your cme um for this and i also wanted to let everybody know that um we are going to be uh changing our office hours um as most of you know we've put our 30 to 35 plus monthly regular tele echo programmings on hiatus so we could launch these kind of nine weekly uh programs but uh starting next week we're going to begin our resume our regular programming in a kind of staggered way so over the next two to three weeks all of our regular echoes will come back on online for you all we're going to keep all of our covet programming except we're going to reduce our office hours to just uh on mondays and we hope that doesn't pose too much of an inconvenience we wish we could have nestor here every single day of the week he's been unbelievably outstanding so but nestor's going to be with us on mondays from 12 to 1 as well as fridays during our covet echo sessions so just remember that to get all your questions answered in this office hours please join us on on mondays from 12 to 1 and then on our covet echo nestor will be with us as well as folks from the department of health michelle harkins our hospital epidemiologists and we have cases on that session as well um and again the cme leak just got posted at 12 54. and i think um maybe with that i'll ask nestor if he has any other you know instead of going to a question you know given the the the questions and answers anything that you'd like to maybe mention before the end of the hour nestor no i just really like to thank uh for all the questions all the participants uh for all the questions and also the the participants that actually helped me answer some of the critical questions especially about the navajo nation and what doh is doing um and and and about the homeless it's really really i mean i have learned more than than than what i uh that i teach in the in these sessions with the interesting question and with all the the collaboration with with with the participants so thank you very much and it's really uh i hope to see you next monday on on the office hour again and on friday on the on the general kobe session thank you thanks nestor i might mention that the covet echo um session on friday we have a very interesting case of um a couple patients who continue to be test positive for like over a month despite multiple tests that we can discuss and um and carla do you want to mention what the the didactic presentation will be on friday sure thanks jana yeah so um laura chevy one of our um unm id faculty is going to be giving a presentation on um what what unm basically is doing for in terms of ppe and what our new guidance looks like and a bunch of people that are on the committee as well will be on the call so if you have ppe questions it'll be a really good time to get them answered at least from from the perspective of what the university is doing and if we missed any of your questions today we um we'll we can we'll catch them on friday or we'll catch them next monday but we've got to the majority of them and we appreciate everybody who's been on the call thank you everybody thanks everyone here okay thank you everybody for joining today's session echo staff please remain on the call for a quick debrief,,4/22/2020
3,foreign okay uh can everybody here is the sound okay fantastic well welcome uh to the covet infectious disease echo uh we're so happy to have dr sosa again and hope everybody had a nice weekend i know many of you were working but if you weren't hoping you had a little time off with this good weather we're so happy again to have dr nester sosa with us from infectious diseases at unm just wanted to remind everybody this is joanna katzman here that um our infectious disease office hours program um it has been reduced to just once a week it's now today mondays from 12 to 1. it won't be on wednesdays any longer so we'll have uh the session today uh we'll have uh the critical care echo with michelle harkins on thursday from eight to nine and then the the covet echo on fridays from 12 to 1 where we have many specialists including dr uh nestor sosa dr sosa is a professor in internal medicine infectious diseases and is the division chief and wanted to let nestor give us a brief update from the last time we talked to him last week to see if he has any comments or updates for us nestor thank you joanna thank you very much to everyone uh for coming back to our echo monday office hour echo on kobe 19. yeah i have a couple of um topics that i like to to highlight first of all um it's a congratulation to the echo organization there was a a piece in the new york times uh praising the the job that the state of new mexico have done with this with this epidemic and the echo project was mentioned there among other efforts done by the governor and and her team uh so i think we should feel uh proud of that uh although i i would hate to be uh triumphant too early we have to keep our guards up there's in the northwest and southeast of the state but it's a good thing that we have been recognized nationally as you know having responded well to this uh to this epidemic and the fact is that we most of the hospitals especially in central new mexico have not been overwhelmed and have been able to to in some way help um the situation in the northwest so it's it's good that we we were congratulated the the second i think important uh notice it's uh on the cdc website uh they actually added six new symptoms to the to the conditions that need to be considered when when you know considering testing for kobe they added um and things that we have been discussing things like anosmia um chills uh persistent shaking chills um muscle pain and and also sore throat as a symptom suggestive of um of course night team so not just the three classical fever cough and tornas of breath but now we because we have learned more they have added more symptoms and and interestingly enough and osmia and loss of also taste um agusa it's it's also there in the in the list of symptoms so that's that's an important piece of information also there have been two uh very nice publication and i invite everybody to read in the new england journal of medicine one about it was sort of a case review very similar to what you guys do in echo they presented a case and discuss it and and go over the uh the case is called mild to moderate um copy 19 and it's interesting because they review most of the important factors on clinical presentation diagnosis and even something about treatment and infection and prevention infection control and prevention on a case on a mild case but because we sometimes we put too much emphasis on the icu on on the most severe cases and very little has been published on on mild cases how do you what do you do at home what do you um your surveillance at home should be like so i think i i think this article uh fills that void and it's it's very very interesting and they also publish the experience from the seattle nursing home from the skillnor facility um another article in in the new york times published recently and they actually detected a significant proportion of pre-symptomatic viral cells which we have been discussing but now it's well documented 56 percent of the of the residents in that nursing home were actually shedding the virus without symptoms and we're talking early folks so even early in the disease they were relatively asymptomatic and they were already um you know infecting other people obviously inadvertently infecting other people until they were actually develop symptoms so it's very important to see that that early uh suspicion of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission it is occurring even in these uh extreme uh conditions age condition like like a nursing home very elegant study on the epidemiology of what happened in that nursing home so those are my introduct introductory remarks um i'm really thrilled to be here and ready to answer the questions and discuss and if any if anybody can help i also appreciate it thank you dr sosa um i can't forget letting everybody know that we that kent noseworthy is our fantastic digital librarian so many of the things that already dr souza has said kent has put them in our chat chat box that you all have please don't forget that um if you want to get any of this information it's all it's all kind of journal articles cdc information you need to copy and paste what you found in the chat and put it into your own browser we can't put any hyperlinks because of zoom zoom security information a few other housekeeping items that i felt to say at the beginning please turn on your cameras if you have a camera linked to your um you know computer or your electronic device it's a much better way that we can all see each other and learn and i'll teach i'll learn echo echo model also um if you have questions um we're going to try to get to all of the pre-registration questions we're even going to try to get to your chat questions um uh please um please know that we we tried to get to all almost every question in the in the session please refrain from um unmuting unless we asked you just because there are so many participants on each session and finally at around 45 minutes after the hour we will start um uh we will start copying the cme link um on this session so also finally wanted to let you know that our project echo website for covid um programs is updated and you can go to that each week and we do have a collaboration with the cdc going on and and they do the cdc doesn't have anyone being forwarded to a short haul voicemail the cdc has a 24 7 hotline um i think that kent is going to be putting that hotline number on uh so if any any 24-hour period seven days a week if you have a question you can call the cdc and they're they're also sending some clinicians are away for some just-in-time learning so um i think also dr eugene marciniak from the department of health is on the line and i'm hoping dr marciniak that we might call on you for a few doh related questions if that's not too much trouble so i'm going to start some some questions right now and then dr carla thornton also from unm infectious disease and my colleague at project echo is going to co-facilitate with me as well so dr sosa um a couple of first questions here can plasmapheresis be used to avert a corona coronavirus cytokine storm that was a question that we had at the top of the list yeah i haven't seen a specific paper on plasmaphrases and i would be glad if the person who asked the question can you reference but i haven't seen really a specific publication on plasmaphrases but i can tell you that there are some devices called a ferrous column that they're actually being considered and it's actually similar you pass the blood through this uh column that actually uh captures some of the cytokines and and that's been looked into you know with the idea of doing a research trial i don't think they have used it clinically yet but it's being considered as a therapeutic uh modality for especially for the cytokine storm that patients experience when they are when they have the severe variety of this disease in the icu and have the the long infiltrate and the multi-organ failure but i think i mean i don't think if somebody have i don't know if somebody has actually looked at just regular plasmapheresis as some or plasma exchange as a modality of treatment in this case dr sosa a couple more treatment related questions one is um has there been any discussion in in treating cova 19 patients as though they were premature infants or cystic fibrosis patients for instance like with surface surfactant or mucomist no i have not seen uh i have not seen any specific publication to that regard um actually in something related to that we uh you know initially use the term ards uh to to uh to call this uh the long complication associated and i think uh now that the icu and i'm not an intensive care unit a physician but i i have read uh some of the reviews about the the intensive care and actually the the compliance of the loaning it's it's different to the regular airbn so this is sort of an atypical or slightly different arvs from what our colleagues in the icu are are mentioning but i haven't seen anything published towards that to a treatment of surfactant or or neuchromis or any other specific therapy thanks dr sosa we have a lot of kind of treatment related very interesting questions today another question that came in is um does being on losartan offer protection against cova virus yeah that's a great question and the the question is it's based on the fact that this virus we have discussed this the the sars sarcoscope ii virus uh similarly to sars they use the ace2 receptor uh which is a receptor that it's it's distributed within the lungs and and many other organs in the body and presumably uh using um angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may influence one way or the other of the disease we don't have clear evidence of benefit or damaging effect from these drugs i have seen two retrospective studies from china in which they actually looked at their patients and specifically looked at their hypertensive patients and at the subgroup that were receiving either angiotensin receptor blocker or or or um or capital pre lysine protrapo drugs and they found that some some of this in this some of these stories there was sort of a protection against severe disease but it's something really very preliminary is retrospective uh subject to some bias in the recruiting of of the the subject uh because there is a theoretical concern that if you use a receptor blocker there may be an increase like a compensatory increase in the receptor so so more virus can attach to the respiratory tract so so i've seen arguments both in favor and against the the truth of the matter is that right now the the cardiology societies in europe and in the u.s have not recommended changing anything or adding or or eliminating any of these drugs if a patient is taking it when they develop copy they should stay on the same drug um and and not modify because the evidence is not enough to to do you know either suspend the treatment or or add it to their treatment there's no evidence either way joanna you're muted sorry carl i have a couple of kind of related questions that relate to um uh the coagulation malfunction that is seen more and more with with patients uh on covid um one question from from julian el rito says is covet seems to cause coagulation malfunction is there a role for prophylactic anticoagulation outside the hospital setting and kind of similarly dr sosa another uh clinician asks uh do patients who are on 81 milligrams of aspirin have protection uh for them you know regarding the microthombre from the virus wondering what your thoughts are or if you've read anything about this yeah i can comment on what i have read i mean uh yes it is true that that these viruses have been associated with a pro coagulant state and they have been case reports of for instance strokes in younger patients patients between the ages of 30 and 50. after kobe having basically cerebral thrombosis they have been also the documented pulmonary embolism and did venus thrombosis in hospitalized patients uh and so for the for those reasons and and also the the markers in the blood test that that points to our proqual and state of the most severe patients most of the hospitals and in fact the society of hematology are recommending uh prophylaxis of patients um but it's not dissimilar to what would you do with a patient that is going to be hospitalized so they're recommending low molecular weight heparin in in cases that are managed on the floor for patients in the icu they're actually being a little bit more aggressive higher dose of of of heparin being used and obviously if the patient develops a a dvt or a pe uh then they should receive therapeutic doses of antiqual and i haven't seen that much on outpatient management and in fact this this review by the by the new england journal of a mild to moderate case they don't mention the use of routine anticoagulation i guess unless the patient has some other contributing factors like a previous episode or maybe is taking um medication that increase the the coagulation have concomitant cancer so unless they have other factors that indicate the the use of anticoagulant uh it's not routinely recommended that i know what and regarding aspirin i haven't seen any specific um story on that it should be relatively easy to do a an epidemiological retrospective review looking at you know these many thousands of patients that we have in the united states and see if in any way they were protected if they were using uh you know prophylactic aspirin or or uh yeah preventive aspirin in their in their medication regimen before calling but i haven't seen anything to that regard uh to be honest dr sosa back to you carla thank you hi good afternoon everyone nestor i just wanted to um there's one other question about anticoagulation from um that came up in the chat just do you know what the specific um protocol is that unm is using and when they would when they would start um anticoagulation yeah i i mean i i've seen the protocol i read it i don't know it uh you know from the top of my my head um but i know they're using you know normal regular prophylactic dose of heparin for those patients that are admitted with kobit and then for those in icu it's a little bit higher than those of heparin but i don't i don't remember by heart i mean i can get the reference and and maybe share it with the person who asked the question um if you if you uh tell me something yeah i would also just mention um joanna i think this is correct that um our anticoagulation pharmacist from unm is going to be on the uh covet the echo that michelle harkins does on thursday morning at eight o'clock so she's going to give a presentation on treatment of of clotting and and covet 19. if people are interested fantastic great so there's a couple of questions mr i know you mentioned that there's this england journal of medicine thing about moderate disease and sort of treat treating people as outpatients can you just talk a little bit about the management of an outpatient with mild to moderate disease nestor you're muted i muted myself i'm sorry i muted myself i think the most important thing is that we don't have any treatment yet so you know despite the fact that we have been you know discussing back and forth hydroxychloroquine uh chloroquine rendezvous we really don't have a treatment that have been shown to be effective and safe so actually the the authors of this paper in the new england they and i think most of the authorities recommend just conservative management so that would be you know the patient have to be at home you know bed rest isolation maintain a good well hydration or good hydration but there's really no specific treatment um they do not do not endorse outpatient use of hydroxychloroquine and in fact the fda have has published an uh and a sort of an advice not to use hydroxychloroquine uh especially hydroxychloroquine combined with acetomycin because of the prolongation of qtc which is impossible to monitor when you're at home because you're not doing an ekg or or cardiac monitoring at home the other aspect is to to alert the patient on the symptoms and signs of worsening so shortness of breath confusion blue lips you have to sort of educate the patient that if they develop any of those symptoms they need to call back uh their primary care or their emergency emergency room and request a real reevaluation and clinical re-evaluation is indicated on those conditions because especially after the first week during the second week that could be this sort of fork you get better or you get worse and you develop the more severe disease so especially on patients with underlying conditions or comorbid diseases advantage advanced age obesity they should be you know educated that if they develop any of those uh warning signs uh they need to they need to be re-evaluated especially with the pulse oximeter or blood gases as they do in the in the emergency room if the patient have the luxury of having a pulse oximeter and knows how to use it they can also report that to the doctor so so in cases there are people who are actually buying oxymeters portable oximeters and you can monitor your your own um oxygen you know saturation and report it back to your physician thank you nestor um leslie hayes um just asked a question on the chat leslie can you just unmute yourself and ask the question sure this is a dumb question but i just haven't been able to find the answer which is if you have a patient with cobot who's at home and they get sicker how do they get to the hospital i mean some of them presumably will be able to drive themselves but otherwise do they call an ambulance for everyone because i just somehow calling a family member who doesn't have covet to take them and seems like a really bad idea yeah i don't know i haven't thought of that i'm not on the outpatient i don't know if anybody in the chat uh it's like an emt or knows the the protocol i've seen all the protocols in the hospital but really haven't thought of that if a person lives by by him or herself and it's at home uh i mean he probably needs to call the the facility and probably the facility will will send him an ambulance or something but i i don't know really uh it's a very good question very interesting question not that question at all i think carla this is joanna dr sosa i think maybe the doh and cdc has guidance on that i'm wondering if dr marciniak might have doh guidance on that hi gene can you unmute yourself maybe not um oh there you go i muted myself i missed the the main question though what was the question about the guidance yeah the question is about um leslie hayes asked the question of when somebody is has is a known coven case but they're at home um if they are getting worse and uh do they call an ambulance or sort of what is the guidance for them to to get to the hospital oh i think the current i think the current guidance is is you would you know if you're if you're getting worse you can call the hospital and tell them your confirmed case or we would be able to assist calling the hospital to tell them their confirmed case because most hospitals that have a lot of cases now they have protocols for handling people coming in with with covet yeah i think that the question yeah just was sort of about transport and it yeah it sounds like there's no specific guidance leslie but um but i mean it sounds like people in the chat who are saying that most people would just go through um what called an ambulance yeah so thank you thank you for those questions um there's also uh a couple of questions nestor about just the the status of remdi severe and convalescent plasma if you can just talk about where we're at with studies um on those two treatments the the disability hasn't been any published study although there was sort of a of a curious phenomenon occur i think right before the weekend the world health organization post in in on its website um the preliminary results of a study with rendezvous in china and it was it showed no efficacy uh but for some reason that post in the webpage was uh was removed from the from the wa show so and this this was a news that was actually revealed by by bbc uh so it was a reputable nurse news source uh and then gilead uh actually gave a public explanation saying that the story uh had not finished and they have not done the complete analysis so it was not fair to to characterize the results of the story in the whole web page so so that was the latest there's really nothing published uh you know towards the efficacy or lack of efficacy of the destiny except for these uh this comment that i that i just made convalescent plasma i think it's it's gaining strength because of the you know the dissolution with hydroxychloroquine and and the fact that that we don't have uh the the study with uh with rendezvous are still available i think convalescent plasma because we are uh uh you know we have a group of people who have recovered from kobe and i are able to donate their plasma and and i think there are several large multi-center stories uh that are going to be performed in different situations i mean they're they're considering using the plasma as prophylaxis so post exposure prophylaxis let's say you your your spouse develops copied and you want to be protected that's one situation in which you can get an infusion of convalescent plasma and seed and you do not develop the disease especially if you're if you are an elderly uh with a person with comorbidities it may be interesting to explore that the other situation is just outpatient to prevent a hospitalization and i know and the most obvious therapy would be patients who are already in the hospital who are sick uh to given the convalescent plasma to to ameliorate the severity of disease so all of that it's been it's been explored john hopkins mayo clinic has a large study and hospitals are actually requesting individual authorization to use convalescent plasma and i think here in new mexico betalan and the transfusion pathologies from different hospitals are actually working in looking for donors and actually uh you know setting up the logistics to do that so i think it's it's it's uh it's something that is going to be study and hopefully we'll have results in the near future this is this thanks dr sosa this is joanna i wanted uh katzman i wanted to let everybody know that a week from friday on may 8th uh liz rosenbaum who's the medical director of italian dis is going to be talking to us on our covet echo on convalescent plasma and how we as clinicians can encourage our covalent positive patients to become donors and how the system might be looking like by that point thanks nestor thank you thank you very much nestor um um juanita i'm i don't want to put you on the spot d but do you mind unmuting yourself and introducing yourself and asking your question because it's a about copenhagen storm but i'm not quite sure i understand it so if you would if you would ask it directly that would be great hi oh remind me about the question um comment on uh the research on hiv resistant um something research oh i wanted to know that um the uh genetic uh predisposition uh to covet 19 whether there's anything that uh you know associated with the cytokine storm like in the past like for example um a lot of infectious diseases not a lot but uh a few uh infectious diseases uh you know um adversarial outcomes kind of tied to certain uh genetic uh backup like uh hiv you know they have some ccr 25 or something that a genetic mutation that can can be resistant to hiv infection i'm wondering is there any have you heard anything like um that people that have tendency to develop cytokines don't have you know genetic predisposition to do that thank you yes that that's a very interesting question in fact it's one of the most interesting questions that i asked myself um just imagine this situation we have two persons both 35 years old one has a completely asymptomatic infection and the other one ends up in the icu and dies i mean what are the difference between those two subjects if they were two healthy 35 year old males why one barely has anything and the other one develops all the complication i think we're going to learn um especially now that we have this genome-wide association we have uh the companies 23 and me that does you know evaluation of the genome on everybody i think we're going to find uh some markers it could be in the hla and the histo compatibility antigens it may be on some of the interferon uh capabilities of the body definitely there's a lot of hypothesis so far the only thing that i have seen published is a relationship with uh blood type a seems to be more um associated with more severe disease than other blood types so that's one genetic marker it's easy to detect there's obviously more severe disease in males in some of the series when you look at the distribution of patients in the icu there tend to be more males than females in the icu and that's because you know the immune system of females in general is much more robust more complex they have a the x chromosome has an you know a whole bunch of genes that we do not have as males so and some of them are immune related so so there's definitely some gender differences in that but we we don't know much beyond that you know why young kids are not affected uh and as i said why are a completely healthy person can have such a divergent uh type of disease but i think we're going to learn that with all the studies that are that are being conducted on on the on covet and the different these prevalence in different population with different genetic markers and and single single nucleotide polymorphisms and things like that but it's it's it's uh it's really fascinating and and probably the secret to to to better control of the epidemic it's there is knowing who is really susceptible to severe disease and who should be protected at all costs as opposed to others we for sure will help just a mildest thank you nestor back to you joanna can i ask a follow-up question about that yes purple i'm wondering is there a study in patients who's taking interleukin inhibitors and covet 19 you know um outcomes because this seems like these are already people that uh some of them may be elderly start taking in the leukemia inhibitors like humera or something for for their disease is there such a study right i think they're looking into that i haven't seen anything conclusive because there is sort of a confounding factor if you're taking one of those drugs although you may be protected and storm you're also in because sometimes you're taking metrotrexa or steroids um together with that so it's a little bit hard to like reach a solid conclusion just looking at the people who are taking for instance humira or some of the other uh but it's something i think we're gonna see publications on that i haven't seen anything categorical um about that people who are taking steroids for instance are immunosuppressed but they should be protected from from a cytokine storm i think we don't know for sure um if any of those preconditions or or pre pharmacological therapy are protective or are actually risk factors i think we want to when we see more granularity into into the the risk factors will we'll learn from that because most of what have been published you know because of the speed of the of the publications are just general you know broad stroke like hypertension immunosuppress patient obese diabetes but they haven't really gone into you know really details on what medication they were taking except maybe for the ac inhibitor that i've seen a couple of publications but it's a it's a very relevant question and and you know we should be able to do it as as the epidemic grows and we can have more time to analyze the the treatment that they were receiving before they develop coffee great thank you dr sosa thank you juanita um this is joanna katzman here i'm going to take over from dr thornton for a few minutes i'm wondering if kim joy might be able to unmute and ask her chat question we had our our case on our covet echo last friday was similar to this kim are you available i am yeah i might have been the same patients was it dr bjorkland that presented it because i wasn't there for that one but anyway we have a couple patients that were diagnosed in march i think with covid and they've had two positive tests since then but totally symptom-free for the last month i'm assuming we have to assume that they're contagious but i was just wondering about that this is joanna katzman how we resolved that case or talked about it is that sorry it's very difficult to tell kind of what stage they're in um nestor do you want to remark on the fact that the the the covet pcr tests might not necessarily test for immediate infectivity right yeah there are many things we don't know for sure with this disease as you may have seen with with some of my answers what we do know is that there are some patients that continue to be positive on the pcr test so the first question is does pcr test or rna in the respiratory secretions equals uh complete infection um we don't know we don't know if we're just detecting residual rna that is not being eliminated from the cells remember rna it's it's part of the of it's it's a molecule that it's within cells so so if if for some reason the immune system does not clear all of the cells that have been infected but they don't have you know they're not producing by virus virulence you can in theory have you know still a positive pcr without that meaning necessarily that the patient is infectious in order to to know that you will need a a very sensitive test that detect uh alive or life viruses and we don't have that because culture of the virus is very insensitive you need very high concentrations of virus in the respiratory secretion to be able to culture them in the lab so we have to wait for epidemiological studies meaning that if somebody have had the disease for more than let's say 10 days and they are still positive but they do not produce any secondary cases at home they may be considered non-infectious even if they have um you know positive rna but the truth of the matter is that we are not sure we have some evidence that people after the seventh day of disease their probably their infectivity decreases significantly we know that there are patients especially patients with very prolonged um disease or severe diseases they have prolonged viral chatting but we really don't know for sure if that means that they are still contagious or not and it's it's something uh of a debate i was saying regarding this case that maybe we can do um detect neutralizing antibodies in their serum if we find neutralizing antibodies you know we can assume that they that they have mounted a successful immune response against the virus and they're probably not infectious but again we don't have a gold standard test of infectivity except for just retrospectively looking at a person that had this prolonged shedding and have not infected anybody and that we don't have yet okay thank you thank you so much kim um dr sosa or our doctor marciniak or juanita perhaps you i either one of you might be able to answer these questions coming up now what's known about the reliability and utility of antibody testing is state-level antibody testing going to be an option soon that's the question i i don't know about the uh reliability i've heard that uh some of them are not um first of all not quantitative and second of all um you know that um they may have false negative or positive that uh on some of the kids but uh i heard uh the governor saying that that that's uh what um you know she will take into consideration i think nationally um the governor uh the governor of new york andrew cuomo had mentioned that pcr and antibody testing and uh rate of hospitalization are the three factors that they're going to use for surveillance so i'm sure they probably talk to each other and looking at these three indicators look like dr carroll has some suggestion hi a couple of notes on this first the uh do you want to introduce yourself yeah hi hi dr alan caron retired bloodbath medical director down here in las cruces um a couple of notes on antibody testing first the best uh survey of this came out late friday night early saturday i'd be able to provide that it's a compendium of zuckerberg genomics uc san francisco and uc berkeley they took 98 samples for 98 individuals who were sampled sequentially through a a well established covid cases and then 98 individuals who had donated to red cross before october which was prior to the first existence of covet 19. and they ran those on 14 different assays a massive piece of work it took almost uh roughly about two weeks of 24 hours round the clock work the work looks extremely good and it's in it is provided on two pages in extremely granular form the basic uh follow-up of those the 14 different manufacturers that were allowed initially by the fda to sell in the u.s is that 11 of them are crap and three of them have some utility only one of them company name sure bio has out of 98 has zero uh false positives uh for um uh so that basically has a sensitivity sorry specificity in the range of 99 okay so uh in so from a standpoint of of utility there are only a few manufacturers that at least by one independent study that is in in in process for peer review now uh shows any reasonable utility all the rest are truly crap the the other problem is that currently and body testing used in isolated fashion on individuals with no prior clinical history is useful only in this from the standpoint of viewing the entire population and is not it you have to understand through uh bayes theorem exactly what it means if you have someone in the 80 percent folks that are no symptoms you're testing with antibody and you hope to get some useful information because currently the our best guess is that the entire population of the us less than five percent have been have been exposed to have been infected with this virus because the disease prevalence is so low even if the test is near perfect a positive test has a very it's it's capacity to truly predict with no prior information whether you're immune or not is very problematic run a a a uh the a protocol or a uh you know these are available online uh looking up um uh the the theorem and you you find out that even in if when five percent of the population alone is positive with nothing else one test even if it's 99 sensitive and 99 specific a positive test turns out to predict true immunity in only five out of six cases one in six roughly 15 percent of those folks will show a positive test but not be immune it's not an immediate only only a few countries are considering the concept of immune passport immune passport for folks with no prior history no prior positive test and doing an antibody test alone doesn't become useful until roughly about 40 percent of the entire population is infected based on uh the on the theorem just on basic statistics yes um i'll be happy to send that that uh uh link to the uh the data from the uh uc uh study donna you're muted thank you dr crow for uh confusing us more with with all the antibody testing that there that that's been created out there and i'm saying that uh saying that kind of kiddingly we appreciate your uh guidance on that um i do have one more question before i uh bring it back to dr thornton um and uh it relates to a question that i was going to ask um i was going to see if um is going to see if one of our partners might be able to ask bonnie cavanaugh in albuquerque is she on the line might be able to unmute we had a about two three weeks ago there was some interesting literature suggesting that um perhaps patients who had an a blood type or a little bit more effective um were a little bit more affected in a negative way to covet if they were covered positive than if they had the oh blood type and i think bonnie's question is related to that can you unmute bonnie yeah i'm here can you hear me yes we can you introduce yourself and tell us where where you're from and what you do yeah hi i am uh bonnie cavanaugh i'm a registered nurse i'm at albuquerque public schools and i'm a child fine nurse and we help families a lot as far as medical information so i'm assuming this will come up and and i am a blood type so i'm curious i believe uh dr nester touched on this uh earlier today and uh i'd like to see what uh additional information i could glean about how a blood type is affected by covet and what the research says yes sure thank you thank you for your question now i'll tell you what i what i have read uh i think they were it was almost like a month and a half or two months ago early in the epidemic there was a study out of china it was a retrospective story and and what they observed was that among the patients in the hospital the proportion of a types was higher than the general population in china so so that was the observation so they concluded that that for some reason unexplained reason because they don't they don't they don't dwell into the pathophysiologic explanation it was just an observation that uh that patients with type a specifically had a higher likelihood of being in the hospital uh if we compare the the frequency of that blood type in the hospitalized severe patients versus those who were not in the hospital during the covet outbreak in wuhan and i think that finding has been uh observed in other places if i remember correctly the second story was out of italy um and it was a similar observation but that's that's as far as the observation goes as i said i i don't know the explanation or why would a blood type be related to these to this virus but it's an interesting observation and we're probably going to find other genetic markers associated with severe disease when we do the genome-wide association um you know there's a lot of databases on the human genome and they can easily cross compare the you know the frequency of certain genes especially those related to immune recognition immune system etc and severity of disease now that we have many more patients in in our hospital with different disease severity and maybe they may be able to find some associations besides just the broad uh association with the with the hate type and it doesn't mean that all the blood types do not develop severe disease obviously that is not true there were you know severe disease in any in all blood types but for some reason the proportion of patients with a type was higher than the than the chinese population in general so it's an interesting finding thank you for that detail dr nester you're welcome go ahead go ahead thanks joanna thank you nestor um there are a couple of questions about immunity and i know we've discussed this in the past but one of our colleagues in crown point asked can someone who has recovered from covet 19 still be a carrier and spread it to other people that's a great question and i'll go over what we know of immunity and i always refer back to the history i mean we we have some we have more experience with the endemic corona buyers the coronavirus that we're actually you know associated with an are still associated with common cold we know that uh endemic coronavirus and there are four of them they when they produce disease in humans the the hosts developed immunity for approximately a years for a few months but there is um there is the production of immunity and and the person is protected at least on you know over one season maybe because this bar is usually circulating the winter so once you get it in the winter you don't get the same virus again you don't get another episode of common cold with the same virus you may be susceptible you know a few years down the road having again the same coronavirus but but not the same on the same season we know that patients who had sars the the sars in 2002 also developed immune response um to it but because sars did not became a pandemic we couldn't really prove that in fact people were completely immune because the virus was basically eliminated after a few months of circulation so now we are left with this new coronavirus in which we don't know if the antibodies that we are measuring in the lab uh and i agree with the with what dr carol was seeing about the limitation of the test uh but some patients do develop antibodies even some patients develop neutralizing antibodies and and that's one of the things that we are hoping will help patients when we use the convalescent plasma but we don't really know in a population basis if a person had copied if they complete if they are completely protected or if they are they are not setting the virus we still don't know that to a complete degree for me and this is just speculation i i would expect that if you have such a systemic disease with an rna virus you should have some type of immunity but we have seen you know these type of situations occur with other viruses for instance herpes viruses which are dna virus we do not develop a completely immunity and in fact we have herpes you know repetitive through our life the same thing with abstain bar once you get mononucleosis if if i culture your throat every day for the rest of your life i'm gonna find uh epstein-barr virus in the throat for years and years after you got it in college or whatever so so it is possible that we we we may have an incomplete immunity with this virus but it would be really unusual because this is an rna virus and most of the rna virus grna generate at least a robust at least temporary uh immune reaction that we do with influenza with uh some of the um like dengue or or zika and other rna viruses i would be completely surprised if there's no immunity at all but it's something that we are studying and it's really very interesting thank you nestor um just i wanted to let everybody know that the cme link went into the chat box so if you uh want to claim cme for this hour then please copy and paste that and put it into your web browser um also just one other really interesting question from leslie hayes related to this she said are asymptomatic patients more likely to continue to carry the virus or people or people who were symptomatic and clear that's a great it's a great question great question what i can tell you that i have seen is that people who excrete the virus for longer periods of time are usually those who have a very severe disease so i haven't seen you know very detailed study on the asymptomatic chatters and how long do they excrete the virus but we know that there are patients especially from the earlier series in china that those who have like the worst disease with prolonged you know pneumonia and intubation um they have a positive code for for a while but i don't know if that's going to be different in asymptomatic uh patients i i would assume it would be like that because if you if you are controlling the virus and your your system is controlling it makes sense that you will not excrete it for such a long time but i think we'll we'll learn that and we'll be uh you know we'll do more studies on asymptomatic shatters to make sure that that is in fact true thank you very much um just another question that came up in the chat um can you talk about uh nestor the possible mechanism by which famotidine improved outcomes in patients um in china and is now being looked at in new york do you know anything about that no i i don't know anything about that i'm interested to see the references i haven't read anything on commodity interesting david um is this from david tempest who's on david would you like to unmute yourself and tell us what you what you know about that or were you where you heard about that i don't know if he has uh audio okay um so there yeah a lot of interesting unknown questions which we'll continue to to answer um i um let's see so nestor i'm not sure if you know this but there are some someone was asking if um any standard uh looking for guidelines to resume fit testing and pulmonary function tests lori do you mind unmuting yourself and and giving us a little more detail about what you're asking hi thank you for the opportunity to ask the question um and i really appreciate echo as well i um were i work in a manufacturing site where we have to use respirators and we have stopped fit testing and doing pulmonary function tests for the obvious reason of this respiratory and i just have not been able to find any kind of guidance looking at all the different sites like cdc and ac oem etc to say when we could potentially start testing again and i was just wondering if anyone had any thought process on this or had heard anything that i have not thank you no i don't have an answer that's a very good question and in fact that's something that we are discussing among ourselves in the hospital i mean we are starting to think about um restarting medically necessary uh time-sensitive procedures we don't call an elective anymore they're actually medically necessary things that cannot really wait any longer and we are precisely uh discussing how to do that under what conditions and and you're right i haven't seen much guidance to that people are speculating do we need to test the person that we're going to subject to to those testing but i haven't seen anything written i think we're gonna we're gonna see uh from the authorities because a lot of places uh healthcare centers and other settings are considering restarting um you know invasive procedure diagnostic procedure some uh medically necessary surgeries and we're gonna we're gonna have to come up with a protocol to to keep people safe because obviously this virus is not gonna go away uh that easily so we need to be you know take some precautions using ppe etc but at the same time coming up with a reasonable testing uh strategy that can help us um minimize the risk of exposure to the to the person doing the feed testing or doing spirometry or any other invasive procedure in or outside the hospital or clinics thank you very much nestor um i'm just gonna a couple of questions were asked about the management of critical critically ill patients in particular about pronation and things like that but i'm going to defer those nester to um if if at all possible it'd be great if um people asking those questions could go to the critical care echo on thursday morning because she michelle harkins talks about uh management of the critical care patient and also particularly about pronation and things proning and things like that so i would defer i'm not going to have nestor have to answer those those questions so joanna um just a few minutes five minutes left i'll turn it back over to you thanks carla i am i'm wondering if dr brislin might want to unmute and ask a question um about she dr prison has a very interesting question about an asplenic uh healthcare provider thanks joanna um that's exactly my question am i muted or am i can you hear me you're good we can hear you thank you um this is a a colleague in the community who's a splenic since childhood has always done well volunteered to work on an expansion team in an icu setting and then wonders if she should take any additional precautions or if none because we tend to think of a splenia as being more of a bacterial infection risk or what i would just love to brainstorm through that with you and see what you think thank you joanna yes thank you heather for your questions always i haven't i haven't really read anything anything specific about um splenectomy or splenic patients and kobe 19 and you're right in general the most common complications for us planning patients are are bacteria usually encapsulated bacteria like meningococcals or streptococcus but i haven't seen really an association with severe viral disease and and uh and this so i i don't know i would they would have to look at the you know series in new york where they have you know thousands of cases and see if there's like an over representation of aspenic in those cases but i haven't seen anything published to that regard to be honest but it's an interesting question thanks heather we can also take take a look into that um i'm wondering we probably have time for about one more question one or two more questions um uh nestor this is more of a kind of what's going on in the community um erica from albuquerque asked do we know what's going on with the field any field hospital status at this time no i would defer that question to the the colleagues here from the department of health i'm really not not aware i'm really human-centric type of thing dr marciniak do you know if there's a possible field hospital opening um yeah i think the uh this dr actually the only the only one that i know that it's an alternative parasite is in the gallop area and i'm not sure how it's being staffed because it's way far away from where we're working um they're actually having some volunteers and they're paying mrc volunteers to work or at least they're offering them to pay to work there so that's that's the only one i mean there's the ability to get field hospitals going but at this point with our cases sort of stabilizing we may not need to have more field hospitals in new mexico thank you um so much and with that i might add that um we're trying to bring a speaker on for our friday covet echo to talk about what's going on in in western new mexico more in mckinley county um and and with the patients in the navajo nation um as well so we're trying to get a talk for friday right her friday's covered echo we have a case set up as well and i think with that i might let folks know we have in addition to the programs that i mentioned we have a first responder resiliency echo at two o'clock mountain time today um four o'clock eastern time and one o'clock pacific time and it's really for all clinicians whether you're a first responder like paramedic firefighter law enforcement or you're any front line clinician it's it's available to you um it's going over a psychological first aid and how to cope in this very stressful covent environment has a large hub hub team with psychiatry psychology counselors we have a pastoral care emergency room doctors um internists all on the line um and again reminding people to get their cme i think we're going to put the cme link up again and wanted to ask dr sosa if he has any last words no just thank everybody for the interesting question you guys keep me reading and studying now i'm going to go back and see the motivating look for motility and some of the other questions that you have asked me keep me uh stimulated uh and busy thank you very much and i'll see you next friday thanks dr sosa thank you eugene marciniak and juanita barapa and everybody on the line thank you to all the participants thanks dr thornton,,4/27/2020
4,hello dr katzman are you able to hear me can you hear me oh now i can yeah it's working it i i got it to work my family i ran into the office uh but now i'm back in my it's working now can you hear me yes could hear you great i'm glad to um i'm glad that it's working now um let me just and can you see me okay yes that's much better good actually actually it's weird my angle with this it looks like i'm looking down but i'm actually looking at the if your camera's not attached to the um the computer screen correct right right um i'm just gonna have to do the best i can right today okay how about now i mean let's see with it it's okay with the angle that you have your computer screen and the angle of the camera it does appear that you're not looking directly at um the camera but it's not terrible how about if not now does it look like i am yes so when i make my announcements i'm gonna be okay now let me actually now let me open box um okay now now let me read from box and see if i'm it looks like i'm looking at the camera can you tell me absolutely so one of the questions is blah blah blah blah blah does that look make it look like i'm looking at the camera um it it's you're looking slightly down but it's not it's it's pretty close okay perfect i'm just gonna go with that awesome okay and i'm gonna i'm gonna try to go connect with carl and c who who wants to do intros i'll be right back okay yeah and i had started that group text message so okay thanks rebecca so much thank you hello dr sosa do you want to check your volume and sound hello one two three perfect good thanks great how are you doing today good awesome yeah today i'm in the hospital so i have to go see patients later after the the this session okay well i'm sure this session will go really well today and so um thanks for being here and if there's anything that comes up just let me know okay thank you rebecca thanks okay hello dr thornton i see that you're uh joined us hi oh hi there you are thanks sure your sound sounds pretty good so good good afternoon everyone and welcome to infectious diseases office hours we're really happy to see everybody my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician at the university of new mexico and one of the associate directors at project echo and i'm happy to be here with you today i also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who is also one of the associate directors at echo and we are co-facilitating this so she'll be helping with the questions um when we get uh to that point so again really appreciate appreciate everyone being here i just have a couple of announcements before we get started um as many of you know project echo we like to see people's faces and we feel like it builds community so if you have a video camera and you can turn it on we would love to see your face uh we also will try to address all of the questions that we got in the pre-registration and and we but we encourage questions during the session itself so if you have a question about something that's being said or just a question that you weren't able to submit please put it into the chat box we'd actually appreciate for people not to answer those questions in the chat box chat box and to leave them to the the to dr sosa and the other um expert panelists that we have invited today a couple of other things if you we we do have our digital librarian kent northworthy is putting things into the chat constantly he'll whenever he hears something he'll put a reference to that and we have we can now uh click directly onto those those hyperlinks for the last couple of weeks we've haven't been cut and paste them but we can now actually directly link under the you can uh click onto the hyperlinks and also just wanted to let everybody know that our website's been updated with a bunch of new resources so i'm going to get started i'm going to um i'd like to introduce dr nester sosa he's the chief of the division of infectious diseases at unm health sciences center and as you know he's been doing these opposite hours now for almost a couple of months almost we have a and i'll have i'll let him also just introduce himself and and give you a brief update before we move into the questions but i also wanted to let you know that marla sivers who is an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the department of health and has been involved in other echoes is on today and will i i know that many of the questions will actually be going to her as well so i want to introduce marla and um carissa culbreth i understand is also on she is um one of the directors at tricore laboratories and has been really involved in covid19 testing and i know there are a lot of questions about testing as well so i am going to turn it over to dr sosa and let him again introduce himself and give you a brief update uh on on covet 19. hi thank you carla and thank you joanna uh yes my name is nestor salsa i'm an infectious disease division chief here at unmh and i would like to to go over a few interesting publications that have been revealed in the last few days i think and and in previous echo i had the question of the the relevance of the use of ac inhibitors or or angiotensin receptor blockers if they were harmful or helpful well on may 1st the new england journal actually published the results of three different studies um evaluating this question precisely and there were you know different design studies there was one publication of a database of cases of kobe and they checked their their medication there was another case control from it from italy in which they included over 6 000 patients and another story from new york so these are these are three different um three different modalities of studies and three different methodologies and they all reach the same conclusion and instead there was no harm effect or no association with increased risk of ac inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers and the and the risk for kobe in general and the risk for severe calling and in fact one of the studies actually uh patients who were taking ace inhibitors seem to be protected from more severe disease and this is something that was already observed in one of the earlier stories from china so there is an also an elegant editorial in that in that new england journal issues so i think uh you know we can continue using those uh medications for our hypertensive patients without any significant concern based on these uh uh three really large uh really large uh studies and and and with the analysis done by the new england journal the second the second um issue that i want to raise and i think i've seen this on the news but now has been published in a letter in the new england journal is the increased incidence of stroke in young patients there's a report of five patients younger than 50 years in new york that actually had large vessel strokes um with uh in general no significant risk factor for them except for the fact that they have kobe so there's definitely this association with increased coagulation and strokes not only in elderly patients in the icu but also patients who are younger developing this unexpected quote-unquote unexpected thrombotic events um after having copied or while they're having uh kobe uh another piece of good news i have a lot of questions on ppe um and i think idsa just published i think yesterday will be the day before yesterday uh guidance idsa is the infectious disease society of america so they they publish guidelines about the use of ppe and their opinion about you know surgical mass versus respirators etc they actually address eight questions eight different questions regarding ppe i put in the chat already the reference for the for the idsa guidelines so you can you can check it it's very nice very succinct and practical and they are very much in line of what the cdc have been recommending and we have been been doing here at unm unmh but it's reassuring to see that this uh um expert group has come up with with also with recommendations and there's also an explanation why they they give every every every uh recommendation finally something that we have addressed also that i have mentioned that since the epidemic entered the united states there have been an association with obesity and in the landsat in a recent publication in landsat um a group of researchers from here from the united states and they they gather information from different hospitals and they actually found an association between obesity and copied and not only that that obesity lowers the age risk for copies so the the the higher the bmi the the lower the age necessary to have a severe coping so so so obesity seems to to make younger patients more susceptible to the severe complications of kobi than they have a nice graph there with where they correlate bmi with with age and there's obviously um you know those patients who are young and we're affected and and we're in icu were actually heavier than those that that were not so so now we are recognizing that as a significant risk factor for more severe uh kobe 19 disease and finally the fda um as you know approved the severe uh you know emergency use and they have given also an informational um uh sheet of of of how to use it and i i post the the link also at the beginning of the chat and where you can get instruction for those who are actually at some point in the future going to prescribe this to their patients uh they have very useful uh information there uh the only safety issue or the main safety issue within deciber seems to be lft so we probably have to check or follow the lfd's of this patient so those are the those are essentially the the updates that i that i have and i'm you know more than ready and willing to to answer and discuss questions thank you thank you oh go ahead no no you're okay thank you so much nestor i just i'm gonna turn it over to joanna for questions but i also wanted to just let you know that um also our um colleague laura chevy who's an infectious disease physician with us and real and is really leading the ppe effort uh at unm is also on so any questions about any questions that we can ask about answer about ppe we're happy to to give to laura as well go ahead joanna thanks carla thank thank you mister um joanna katzman here i work closely with dr thornton at project echo i'm a neurologist um i think i might want to see if marla seavers who's one of the state epidemiologists might be able to help us with a couple of questions um uh marlar i think i might have seen you a minute or two on video are you there yeah i'm here joanna oh thank thanks marla um uh there's a couple of questions um one is about the fact that you know we're kind of new mexico surrounded by arizona and texas that have kind of eased up on their uh restrictions and one of the questions is that now that now that texas has kind of opened up their less essential businesses and and many people from el paso come into las cruces for shopping and eating out wondering if there's going to be increased screening in that sector of the state thanks joanna so i think you know we're very concerned about this as well um that we're going to see a surging cases in that region as people are able to travel more freely to texas for routine errands and shopping we have expanded our testing capability in that part of the state by providing test locations every day at the public health offices as well as deploying um i think five of the um abbott rapid platforms in that region um of the state and i looked on i saw that come through chat and i looked on the website today it looks like there's you know five testing locations uh just in las cruces that are open today so there is a variety of testing that is available um you know and to the extent that there is staffing and ppe and locations to conduct testing a department of health is certainly not limiting testing in one region or prioritizing testing coming from another region over over another we try to make test sites available in every county in new mexico through our public health offices as well as partnerships with hospitals and other clinicians who can assist us with that work so there's five places open today in las cruces people can get tested thank you so much marla um also leslie hayes had a question about any more oh it looks like joanna you're muted if you're still on okay yes hi joanna joanna are you there looks like we may have lost joanna i'll try nicole okay thanks matt great so i think you um joanna had asked the question that leslie hayes i'm just looking for it leslie did you want to or marla did you see it on the chat i see it are there any plans to provide more widespread quarantine centers in new mexico i think that was the question from leslie yeah thank you nestor i did see that question from leslie and i can say yes that there are work groups that are working on setting up you know what we're kind of calling non-medical observation centers we do have quite a bit of um quarantine capacity available right now through rooms that have been set up with different hotels around the state to be able to quarantine people who aren't able to quarantine at home um but there are several proposals that are in the works right now from different groups to set up um sort of you know a model where you've got a a non-medical observation site for people who need quarantine a little bit of that is happening in the gallup area but looking at other places in the state for those kinds of centers as well thank you marla before we leave the question of testing there are a lot of questions about testing i have to say and i i know that i'm a lot of people saw probably the article in the newspaper this weekend and just that there's going to be a dramatic increase in the number of tests that are being done daily over time with some support from the cdc i don't know if our like you can just descri can you just tell us a little bit about that and if there's a um a unified approach from the department of health about who will sort of sort of how the testing is going to start to play out are you talking about serology specifically carla no not serologies i mean basically you know the article said that they're gonna we're gonna dramatically increase the number of tests and now they'll be um more people will have tests a bit they can get testing done they couldn't in the past because they didn't meet criteria but i think it just sort of opened up a big bunch of questions about who is actually going to start uh where the what's going to happen with testing in new mexico over the next couple of months sure i think testing has kind of really been rolled out in phases you know we started where everyone started which is really a limited amount of testing and only testing people who traveled or had certain symptoms and over time as more testing has become available in the state and when i say that i really mean uh lab capacity um and specimen collection kits we've you know decreased those barriers over time um and so for several weeks now maybe as long as a month um we've basically said anyone in new mexico um you know can be tested without having symptoms or a travel history or a known exposure there are some companies that have set up their own testing sites which do have their own criteria so i definitely have heard from people that they've gone to a particular site to get tested maybe operated by a health system and that testing site is limiting who they're testing based upon symptoms or other criteria we don't have those restrictions um at any testing that's being done by the department of health so if the department of health is having a drive-up testing event or testing through our public health offices again anyone can be tested the state laboratory as well as tricore laboratories in particular in new mexico have continued to bring on new instruments new equipment and new personnel to be able to perform additional testing so that we're not limited by our lab capacity and those laboratories right now are running you know 24 hours a day seven days a week to process tests and so you know we're really trying to maximize our capacity in the state as well as working with sort of some non-traditional partners as well and i don't know if this was in the article that you read carla talking about testing that might be available through sandia national labs and los alamos national labs as well so we're really trying to expand testing anywhere that we can and again we did um procure 12 of the avid rapid test platforms and deployed those out into more rural areas around the state to assist with testing capacity there but we're going to just continue to add capacity every day at either these clinic locations public health offices you know we're expanding our surveillance testing in nursing homes as well as among other special populations so it's a big push to get as much testing out as possible and there are places around the state that people can be tested without having symptoms or unknown exposure great thank you so much um that's very helpful um i also just wanted again a testing question just like you mentioned serology and there was a test a question about how reliable basically are these tests are the serology tests and how will they be used in new mexico and also karissa's on marla a few i don't know if you have any comments about that but we can also talk to go to her and nestor as well yeah i'd love for carissa to weigh in on that carissa do you um i don't see you on my screen but i believe you're here yeah i'm here sorry i'm having some problems with my camera um so i think we're still learning um about what the serology tests mean um many of the assays uh the the sensitivity of the tests are are decent and the specificity of the test based on the studies that we've done within our laboratory and others they test serum specimens against patients who've been previously infected with other of the common coronaviruses and um ensure that there's no cross-reactivity with those type of coronaviruses and then other viruses so you know it looks like the specificity is fairly good but i think there's still pretty limited indications for use um this is not a test for immunity um because we just don't know what the immune status of persons who've been previously infected um would be so tricor has pretty limited indications for use for our coronavirus antibody test which we now have available but with very very limited indications for use and so i think we have to be very conscious about our use of the test because we're really not sure exactly what those answers uh what a result either positive or negative would indicate in all patient circumstances thank you carissa nestor do you want to talk also go ahead yeah we have here una unm um testing and i'm sorry yeah lab testing committee and they have been discussing how to better use this test obviously with the reservations that clarissa made the comment some potential uses are uh under like a serial prevalent study you can you can probably use it uh just to to gauge how many or what percentage of the population have been affected that's one potential use uh the other is to identify potential donors people who already have immunity and they have a history of the disease and maybe we're not tested you can check for antibodies and and see if you can uh invite them to donate their plasma uh and finally there there may be a few cases of patients that um have a negative pcr but very highly suggested clinical uh picture and you can you can use the test as a sort of a of a um you know to help when the pcr is negative and the clinical situation is highly subjective of the disease i'm not saying that we we are going to use it on all patients you know in those situations but those are probably um potential uses for the serology with the information with the limited information that we have now and the other thing is that they have been in at least in the published literature a lot of variability especially for the lateral flow test and the rapid test that they uh and and we are you know more uh or relying more on on on laboratory based elisa's and other uh as opposed to just rapid tests or point of characters that may be less reliable thank you mister so i mean it seems like from what what what i understand and what what's been said here that there are very few indications for individuals who just request serology testing that it doesn't have a lot of meaning that you won't be able to guide if they're asking you specifically as a provider i think it's very hard to get really good guidance about it and it's not really recommended from what i understand um and marla did you have any comments from the department of health standpoint thanks carla i appreciate your comments carissa and nestor um you know we are concerned here at the department of health um as well about what indications um for ordering these tests will be and how people will want to interpret those results um i think people will want us to make policy decisions based upon those results um and individuals who request that sort of testing um you know are likely to want to use those results um you know to mean things that we can't really say that they mean that allow them to have more freedom of movement you know go back to work sooner um travel that sort of thing so you know we're also concerned about how those results are going to be interpreted and how people will want to use them thank you marla and there's a couple chris if you can just address this and this has come up i think almost every time that we've had a one of these office hours but just talk about the sensitivity and specificity of the pcr testing and there was also a question just about the turnaround time for the pcr tests sure um so sorry the sensitivity of the test you know until we get a chance to dive into the data to look at the clinical sensitivity and specificity we base our determination on um the actual ability of the test to detect virus in a um in a sample um and so all of our tests that we're performing at tricore are highly sensitive fewer than 500 copies per ml and often much lower and other assays that are performed at other facilities will have differing sensitivities um i think it's pretty clearly documented at this point in the literature um that the avid id now does have um is is a bit less sensitive than some of the other methods even some of the more rapid methods like the cepheid um is the abbott id now isn't quite as sensitive as those methods um but the sensitivity again is is good from an analytical perspective and then from a clinical perspective it's really important to look at um the specimen that's collected and having a good nasopharyngeal swab is important um when the patient is in their course of disease we're seeing how much more that is playing a role so earlier in disease there's a higher likelihood that virus would be recovered but later in disease even in a person who's progressing um becoming more symptomatic and they're and they're having a worsening clinical picture we're seeing that there's less virus in the nasopharyngeal space and the virus begins to move down into lower respiratory samples and so in that scenario if a person has been symptomatic for a while and continues to worsen then collecting a lower respiratory sample like a sputum a trach aspirate or a bal is may be more beneficial in those cases the specificity of the test is very very high and there's really no evidence of cross reactivity with either the common coronaviruses or other sars1 or mers viruses i did notice somebody asked about turnaround time i'll tell you at tricore we have a 24-hour turnaround time for our test um and we actually have a graph where we're um we're actually putting it out there um every day and you can see what our average turnaround time is um and you can also see our total volume tested so right now we've been at a 24-hour turnaround time for a pretty good amount of time and and hope to keep it right around that thank you so much back to you joanna okay thank you uh thanks so much carla i'm sorry that i had such technical difficulties um uh i'm gonna turn out from testing to more kind of symptom management and co-infection type of questions a question came in from a clinician in albuquerque saying as a pcp is there anything i should do to manage early covet patients and what about pregnancy uh we this was asked early on and i guess the question really is is there anything kind of new in early management of covet patients no i haven't seen any any significant change aside from just general supportive care keep the patient well hydrated the infection control measures that you need to take if the patient is at home and and also just the surveillance i mean to have contact with the patient uh regarding and instructing the patient when to call the the health center uh obviously if they become short of breath or they have developed cyanosis um or confusion those are clear indications and and um i think even the new mexico department of health and the cdc gave give instructions specifically on how to monitor space at home but there's no um like recommended therapy or antiviral to take at home at this point in fact the rendezvous is an ib medication so it's probably going to be used um almost exclusively in hospitalized very sick patients rather than than early ambulatory or non-hospitalized patients and i i really have nothing else on on pregnancy i mean i saw a publication on a on a miscarriage associated with covet in the literature recently i think it was lancer or jama um that's like the only the most recent thing over the last couple of days and apparently they found some infection or viral presence in the placenta uh something that we haven't really appreciated but it's only one case if i remember correctly uh we're still learning a lot about you know pregnancy and newborns nestor a quick question alan crowe las cruces um i am seeing increasing concern from a number of individuals uh folks monitoring pulmonary status that the lack of shortness of breath is a false uh indicator of stability that these individuals are becoming progressively hypoxic at the uh those that will progress after seven to ten days and then they're crashing because they're not short of breath because they're not hypercarbic there the the virus in some way may be attacking either the red cells or the um uh the capillaries that are lining the lungs or potentially decreasing the amount of surfactant slightly so that they're somehow they're blowing off their co2 but they're not maintaining their oxygen therefore tracking shortness of breath is not a sensitive indicator but performance is that these individuals should be encouraged to be up and walking a a small at least a small amount and any decrement in their physical performance may be an early indicator that they are becoming hypoxic if in the absence of because we may have lots of thermometers but there are not a lot of percutaneous oxygen sensors so that is a suggestion that i have seen repeatedly coming up recently that we should not be depending on on temperature we should be watching these folks to see is their performance capacity dropping i've certainly seen it in uh in a number of the athletes that i have spoken to by phone that have been have had coveted cases frequently that precedes or you know in any case back to you thank you alan yes thank you dr carl um i wanted to go to um some questions of kind of about exposure and and and when there's a family member who might be uh covet who is covet positive and how to best kind of uh keep them sick keep the other members safe some questions came in regarding that the question specifically is read are there any recommendations for families when one person is positive are there any lodging alternatives other than the patient's house and i'm wondering maybe that's a question perhaps for marla sabers so cdc does have recommendations um for how to quarantine someone in the household who's positive but it basically consists of you know keeping them in a separate bedroom with their own bathroom keeping that door closed making sure that they're not you know dining with the family in the kitchen they're not preparing food so really trying to sequester that person in the house as much as possible good surface disinfection you know with a diluted bleach solution or other disinfectant in the household lots of good hand washing and source control having that person wear a mask whenever they're around other people in the house and people who might be caring for them in the home also making sure that they're using a mask exercising good hand hygiene and good surface disinfection and so those are available on the cdc website if you go to what to do if you're sick section on the cdc website it provides a variety of resources for how to care for someone at home or how to care for yourself at home and also how to know when it's safe to sort of return to your activities and go out of the house again so a lot of good resources there there are alternate sites lodging locations for people who need to be quarantined um or isolated and as i mentioned right now those are really contracts with hotels so putting it someone into an individual hotel room who doesn't necessarily need close medical observation and who is able to care for themselves a little different situation if you have someone at home but really requires a lot of supportive care from family members putting them into a hotel room might not be the best choice for them so that's part of the decision making as well is choosing a safe care location for that person but there are sites available where people can be isolated away from their family in hotel rooms if needed can i just ask a question about that please would that be okay um i've posed this question a couple times just in follow-up how how would someone find out about those sites and what would be the criteria to get in excuse me can you uh possibly um we're trying to keep since we've got 140 people on the line we're trying to um uh have people just kind of um you ask questions and chat but can you that's not interesting spoke up i thought maybe it was permissible yeah that's fine no no can you just possibly um introduce yourself that would be great sure sure i'm debbie mcgrew i just turned off my video because i'm eating lunch but um yeah i've asked the question a couple of times and i just would like to see i i've heard recommendations that they contain the spread there's recommendation for people who test positive who aren't severely symptomatic don't really require hospitalization but to be actually separated more more than just in the home and so what i'm wondering is is there any plan in place in new mexico to do that and if how would an average person access that information great question thank you you know this is joanna we we've had a lot of a lot of kind of questions similar to that and we even had a case last friday where a lot of covet positive patients have been come remaining positive for upward of 30 to 40 to even 50 days and so it's a little it's not exactly like your question dr mcgrew but it's it's fairly similar i'm wondering marla or carissa or even a nester if you want to maybe answer that for dr mcgrew i can answer the part of the question about where does someone find out about those resources so every positive case is being investigated by an epidemiologist here at the new mexico department of health and they have an assigned um case manager who's an epi who's following up with that person on a regular basis to assess the progression of their symptoms make sure that they are able to isolate as recommended making sure that they're able to get access to needed medical care or other supplies and through that process discussing with their assigned case manager if they're not able to isolate at home that would be the point of contact to help them arrange that alternate location oh that's great thank you that answers my question great thank you um so i want to actually just change gears a little bit there i wanted to i mentioned that laura chevy who's with our ppe uh group is on and there was a question about ppe in the chat that i think is really important and i'm just going to summarize it many of you may have seen it but and laura please if you can answer this would be great so just about the you know it's very difficult to wear an n95 mask for a long time and and because it's really is they're they're very good and they're keeping air out they're keeping you know keeping you safe but uh the question is about how is there any what is the safety what's the best way to don and doc these masks if you have to wear them for a long period of time um laura you read the question if you could just address it that would be great yeah it's a great multi-part question and my dogs are gonna help answer if you can hear them i'm sorry um so n95 masks actually were studied in different industries and people tolerated them for at least eight hours so the current cdc guidelines for extended use of ppe of n95 masks specifically is 8 to 12 hours five donnings if you reuse so if you take it off in between you doff between patients um so five uses total or eight to twelve hours um from working with our mickey nurses here it's um one mask has not been sufficient for a 12-hour shift in general um when they are practicing extended use not that they can't wear them for the total but they get saturated and need to be replaced so there is a an excellent set of guidelines in the cdc for extended use and reuse of ppe which will answer a lot of those questions um in terms of how to don and off appropriately there's videos there on how to doff and to read on without contaminating yourself or to decrease that risk for people who are needing to wear n95s for extended period of time we do recommend and the idsa guidelines that just came out also support using either a face shield over the n95 um or putting a procedure mask over the n95 during an aerosol generating procedure with a covid positive patient so for covid negative patients that's not recommended for covered positive patients who are not undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for the time afterwards that's required for viral clearance in the room and 95's are also not recommended um i just want to make sure i got the rest of oh and then um storage when you are if you doff the n95 so you doff the face shield and you'd or you'd off the procedure mask over the n95 store it face down on a paper towel um people have been using tupperware's there's actually some really nice videos on youtube where people have cut holes in each of the four sides of the bottom part of the tupperware where the straps go to hold the mask down or on a paper towel or a paper bag it just needs to be a well ventilated area to let the mask uh dry as much as possible i hope that answers all your questions that's a great comprehensive answer thank you laura i'm just gonna again change here so one more time here there's some interesting questions about iga and nestor i don't know if you can answer these but one of them is does low iga due to celiac disease make patients more vulnerable to cova 19 and then the second one is how does iga immunodeficiency affects covid19 susceptibility yeah i haven't seen any specific publications on on immunoglobulin deficiency and copied i would have to do you know do a little search to see if there are case reports or or somebody have looked into that um but i i cannot really answer more than that thanks semester you know one of my colleagues um is a hepatologist and a colleague of mine works with echo robert gishazan as well and i don't know bob do you know about celiac disease if there's been any any information about uh celiac disease and covid i haven't seen anything and i'm like you all monitoring two to three hours a day but i'll raise my alert level much higher now but the iga question is going to become much more pervasive in terms of testing serology whether it's part of the immune response great question i'll watch and i'll let everybody know thank you bob can you just introduce yourself as well uh i'm robert gish i'm a hepatologist i'm based in san diego but i work at many places throughout california nevada i've been working with carla an echo we did a hepatitis b echo i work at a fqhc in san diego called la maestra and i'm the medical director of the hepatitis b foundation thanks for having me i'm attending this meeting thank you bob darling yeah go ahead there are two stories from china in which they actually measure the immune response they measure igm igg and iga and there seems to be an iga response to the virus very similar to in time and magnitude to the igm but that's as far as i've seen qualities great thank you very much um just nestor have you hear i there's a several questions about um the use of convalescent plasma and i wanted to announce that we're going to have in our echo on friday the um medical director of my talent the blood bank here is going to be talking about that so if anyone's interested to come hear her speak about that but can you just give an update about that the use uh in general and also in new mexico right yeah there have been very few published studies none of the studies are rcts or randomized controlled i think there have been a total of maybe 20 25 patients in the literature um and in this own control open label studies most of the authors have commented that that they saw a beneficial effect that's what we know from the literature um there are a lot of places in the u.s including here in new mexico that have started um to use convalescent plasma i was in in a zoom meeting this morning and i think they mentioned seven patients um around seven patients in total in in our state in different different locations we are uh starting a study here at unmh for hospitalization for critically ill patients um so that's as much as i can as i can tell you but i know they're using it in in you know in the united states and there there are a couple of large multi-multi-center randomized trials to test the combustion plasma not only in the faith in the treatment of patients in icu and general awards but even as a preventive measure after after um exposure for instance for for uh household contacts that are in high risk or or even healthcare workers they have a high risk exposure uh they're going to study as a prevention this is a strategy of passive immunity or or plasma transfusion great thank you um back to joanna back to you are you there i can't actually see you okay not oh there you are joanna yeah can you okay great um uh just wanted to see yeah there's a a couple questions about covetous and other skin related problems and as patients are discharged with coping 19 um what should be taught to care for uh how should they be taught to care for covetous would they ever recover and are there other skin related covet 19 problems yes most of the information that we have are from case reports you know a group of you know few patients that have developed these uh dermatological complications and and in fact we have seen this sort of called frostbite uh reports of frostbite uh lesions in in in patients with coping there has also been a couple of macular popular rash associated with almost more billy form rights associated with kobe and more recently especially in kids they have been the report mostly in the news i haven't seen a publication of kawasaki disease which is also has some dermatologic um and inflammatory features uh so so so those are the the the most recent uh you know publications i i don't know exactly if we are giving any any specific instruction regarding when the patient goes home regarding this as a preventive measure for that aside from your surveillance of of the of the of the skin and reporting any lesions i haven't seen any specific instruction we are using as as a matter of fact anticoagulation or or prophylactic heparin or low molecular weight heparin in most of the of the patients that are admitted with copy to the hospital and and and some more intensive anticoagulation once they are in icu and especially if they develop any of the obvious thrombotic complications that have been reported like dbt pe or or or strokes thank you so much nestor um some recent questions that came in on the chat are just uh uh people wanting uh clinicians wanting to know about kind of the latest ideas you've mentioned many under uh risk factors for for being covet positive you know hypertension diabetes obesity but could you just briefly um go over perhaps some more risk factors that that you might not have touched on um in previous weeks okay yes sir i think that the most important and we know that is age i mean patients over age 65 is considered uh you know risk factor for severe disease and and this is something that it's almost like a those uh effect relationship the older you are the higher your likelihood to have complication so age is one obviously the the big ones are cardiovascular disease pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease is defined very broadly and pulmonary disease includes asthma copd and and other acquire and congenital lung disease there have been an association with hypertension which is not very clear and that generated the the question about the ac inhibitors that i talked to at the beginning but hypertension in some of the series have been also important um and then obviously any immunosuppressive state like transplant in some serious and patients who are taking immunosuppressive drug may be more susceptible and here in the united states especially a certain ethnic group or social socioeconomic groups are also considered risk factors uh latinos african-american and obviously we we have an example of the disproportionate number of native uh americans that are being affected in our own state so i think those those are the the most uh important risk factors that i remember they're obviously depending on the on the series that you see they add one or two uh to to those list of risk factors i think and obesity obviously that i already mentioned it's another another important important factor another is interesting one i've seen uh publication in in favor and against smoking i i saw actually in in a review that that some of the some of the studies have not substantiated that smoking is a risk factor although there in one of the studies that i that i review uh today for the ace inhibitor smoking was considered a risk factor um so so it's interesting it's sort of uh you know in some cases seems to be a risk factor in others uh it doesn't seem to be a risk factor i guess it depends on how advanced your lung disease associated with smoking is thank you so much nestor um another question was any particular guidelines on uh use of remdi severe other than watching the liver function test such as defer watching the gfr if less than 30 cc's a minute um what what are your recommendations in terms of um precautions when using remdi severe right to be completely honest i'm sorry i have to i have to read the the fda i just got it today and i i share with everybody what i haven't read but i promise for the next session i will i will read it in detail i just remember from the studies that that the the most salient feature was this increase in the lfts in three three to five percent of the patient both in the chinese and i think in in the gilead also in a news conference mentioned that that was the only so the important safety alert or safety uh issue that they that they notice in their in their large trial uh but i think we need to look at the data more carefully and i have to read the fda um guidance uh before before i can answer that question esther can i just clarify there were a couple questions just about the definition of do you mean the transaminases or the yes yeah i answered that on the chat but yes what they what they follow was basically just just lfts specifically transaminases and they notice that three percent of the patients in one of the studies are elevated and in fact there were a few patients in the in the faustian studies at the nih that were taken off the treatment because of lft's issues but it was a minority of patients thanks nestor thanks carla um there there's a number of questions i'm asking about um you know the increased cases in in mckinley county and san juan county parts of new mexico and particularly among the um uh native americans and in the navajo nation region and i just wanted to let folks know we are trying to get a talk for our covet echo which which meets on on fridays this friday um and we also have a couple questions regarding convalescent plasma and we do have a talk this friday though already um set up with liz rosenbaum from who's the medical director of italian she's going to be speaking on a convalescent plasma and how covet pos how you can encourage your patients who have recovered from uh their infection with covid and how they might be able to donate blood and how that might um work in terms of a treatment we're also trying to get a case um to present um around someone who's been successfully transfused with some convalescent plasma um just moving on to another question before i pass it back to carla should patients be admitted if they need oxygen or might there be a role in putting them on home oxygen first what do you think about that so this this question is for me or for marla i think it's for you nestor no actually i uh i mean i haven't uh worked in the kobe uh words here in the in the hospital with the you know the discharge part so so i think i cannot answer that that uh that question but i know for a fact that there's some patients that are requesting obscene therapy at home and they are being discharged with oxygen but i i really don't don't don't have an opinion on that but something i would ask michelle harkins uh and some of the other uh that are actually providing direct care to these patients thank you mister um i just wanted to go back to testing for a minute because there was a test specifically about the home testing um and the question is how good is the home nasal swab test and will we be getting it in new mexico and i don't know carissa if you can speak to that um so i don't know about the performance of the home nasal swab um i think that was a a kit that i believe was made available by uh lab core i believe but um i could be wrong i haven't not looked at the performance of that test but so so i don't have any specific data on that the cdc though does recommend on the website related to specimen collection that symptomatic patients can receive a nasal swab but asymptomatic patients should have a nasopharyngeal swab at this time likely because of the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab in asymptomatic patients that you know could perhaps have a lower amount of virus present so i think that's probably one limitation that we should keep in mind for alternative specimen types but i think there's more data that's emerging about specimen types that would be less invasive and potentially decrease the need for ppe and multiple manufacturers are continuing to evaluate those options thank you carissa marla did you have any comment on that i think um you know carissa mentioned i believe it's labcorp that has come up with this home testing kit um and it you know if you're a lab core customer um there's no reason that someone couldn't order that through labcorp um and have it sent to a new mexico uh resident but we're currently not offering that um through the state lab or any of our testing sites thank you very much um there's a question i haven't heard of myself but it's i've heard that there are three known strains of the virus abroad do we know if all three strains have been identified in the u.s nestor do you know anything about that no i know i've seen a lot of publications on the evolution of the virus and the way they are there are mutations in some areas of the bodies and different of the virus in different um papers from italy from from here from the us and and china but i haven't really seen any specifics to new mexico thank you i don't know carissa if you have any comment on that question as well maybe not all right um oh sorry i hadn't take myself off mute so i think um there are there are definitely studies that are looking at the phylogenetic changes in the virus to see if we can do mapping um and so what's really um being seen when we think about strains you know we we talk about strains of of the flu or other other viruses really this is uh one virus and these are small genetic differences that just help us to identify and map where the virus has been rather than any uh difference in so far there's not been any demonstration of difference in disease morbidity or mortality or severity or pathogenicity in the disease so really i think all we know and have seen with the strains is that it's just helping us to get some uh geographic and phylogenetic understanding of the virus rather than anything that has any significant clinical value great thank you very much so um we just have about five minutes left but one of our um our colleagues siri chan khalsa up in northern new mexico had a quick question about a patient-related question um and and we'll see if we can get some answers for you siri go ahead you can update yourself uh can you hear me yeah okay sorry i'm not on video i'm home with my three-month-old so um but i uh had a patient who came into clinic to follow up after being hospitalized for a non-stemi uh on the 22nd of april and when he was admitted he um he had a number of findings that were consistent with a possible covid19 infection including a chest x-ray that showed ground glass opacities he had elevated the dimer his creatinine was a little bit elevated and his 56 long history of tobacco use is obese asymptomatic from a covid19 perspective while he was impatient white cells went up a little bit he got a slight elevation in his alt um and they tested him for covid19 and it was negative and of course you know all of his findings could be explained by the fact that he was in there for a non-stemi and needed four stents placed um but i'm wondering now on an outpatient basis if there's any utility in testing him again for kobe 19 just in case it was a false negative he continues to be asymptomatic however from a respiratory perspective great thank you it's an excellent question mr would you like to address that no i think if the clinical suspicion is high enough um you know there is there is a place to to to consider testing uh and this is a patient that if we if we had readily available serologic testing if if she had uh actually copied in in you know a couple of weeks ago when she was in the hospital or whenever she was in the hospital it's a patient that in theory can be tested for igg and and if if anything should to have a positive ig demonstrating that that episode was in fact um related to kobe because there have been cardiovascular uh even st elevation and non non hd elevation associated with kovitz so if she had also the ground glass and other findings um you know though maybe explained by by the underlying disease i think this is one of those situations in which probably a serologic test would be useful um if you know we have no issues with the sensitivity specificity and availability of the testing it would be a patient that i would do more than anything not just to prove that that is immune or anything just to see if it's uh more likely than not that that she had uh she had kobe uh when she was in the hospital thank you nestor yeah that's a great um uh it's a great question and i think that that would also inform whether or not the contact tracing situation so from a public health standpoint is probably important as well and it is it is a situation at unm where we would consider using this or serologic testing great thank you guys very much you're welcome so we only just have a couple minutes left i just wanted to tell everybody that the cme for this session is in um is is in the chat box now so if you want cme please go to that uh fill out the survey we would love to hear feedback and also to know how to improve these sessions if you have comments and what other um anything else you'd like to tell us and as we mentioned a couple times but we have the the uh the echo on friday and we're going to be talking about convalescent plasma so that should be a really good good session and also there's a critical care session on uh thursday morning from eight to nine that michelle harkins is running where she has a case and a short didactic and they've been very really excellent and joanna i'm not sure if you know what the didactic is for that one that you can announce that as well um i'm not sure the topic i think um i'm not sure the topic but uh michelle harkins is is also having cases every week on the critical care echo as as we are on the covet echo and i just want to let everybody know we also have a first responder resiliency echo open to all all clinicians and that's on mondays from two to three from two to three p.m so that's just in in an hour from now but we we will send out the a reminder on the critical care echo and the topic thanks carla thank you and i just got a text saying that it's neurologic manifestations of of cognitive at this at the critical care echo so that should be very good so we're at the top of the hour and thank you everyone for joining and we will see you see you next week thank you nestor thank you marla and carissa and laura you,,5/4/2020
5,nice to see everyone my name is carla thornton oh my video is not on sorry sorry about that hi everyone carla thornton here with the university of new mexico infectious diseases um physician and i'm one of the associate directors here at project echo welcome again to our covet 19 um office hours with dr nester sosa and i will turn it over to him in just a minute as i just wanted to give a couple of announcements prior to getting started as you all know at project echo we love to see people's faces and build communities so if you can if you do have a camera and you can turn it on please do that so we can see you on video we have a lot of questions submitted but we'll try to get to all of them and we we really want to have questions in the chat as well if people have questions about what's being discussed questions you do have please use the chat box to submit the questions for the help team um and please uh stay muted unless someone on the hub team calls on you like we we may ask you to ask one of your questions or interact with you but if you would stay muted unless being called on that would be great um we have a digital librarian kent norsworthy who is amazing and puts things into the chat immediately after you save them so i don't know how he does it but he'll be providing resource links in the chat um and you can for those of you haven't been on in a couple of weeks you can actually click click on the links in the chat they have been enabled again um so you can do it directly in the chat and there's also a lot of resources on our our website as well also there um there's an updated version of zoom online and the older versions will not work after may 30th so if you haven't updated your zoom in a while please do that and kent will also actually put that link into the chat as well so without further ado we'll go ahead and get started i want to introduce um nestor sosa who is our division chief of infectious diseases at unm and he has been doing this now for a couple of months and it's been very helpful for the community i think but nestor i'll open it up to you and let you give any updates that you have and then we can start in with the questions thank you carla hello everybody it's a pleasure to be here again carla this time i prepare a small slice set uh if i can share my screen um so the update's gonna be illustrated this time around sure um i teach and just has to give you permission but if you guys can give him permission to share there you go all right no i i think it's not um it's not ready yet it says sorry try it again okay you got it all right so yeah so first of all on the news um there are a couple of of uh interesting development i know the fda approved a new saliva test uh for for home use uh under telemedicine so it's an interesting uh finding i think we have uh carissa corporate from from tricus and maybe later on we can we can address that but it was interesting to to see that uh home testing for kobe 19. um also there was a short study on on the sensitivity of the one of the rapid tests the cepheid um gene expert or expert express and and it was very good i mean it had a lot of uh a very high correlation with the with the more sophisticated standard of care um pcr testing so it's good to know that at least one of these rapid testing has a very good uh performance there's also there was an announcement of a new study with the with the rendezvous combined with a with with an anti-rheumatic medication uh the medication is a genus kinase inhibitor so it's a it's a study of of and and the drug is called baritini which is used for rheumatoid arthritis and it's going to be uh studied by the naid so by the faushi group uh so i think that's gonna be an interesting and i think the way the the the field is moving is towards combination therapy and i'll mention a little bit of that in a couple of seconds so some of the updates uh the the infectious disease society of america published uh their own guidelines on testing it's very similar to the cdc but they actually recommend um you know specific testing for symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic individuals under certain uh specific conditions so i i really invite you to read this this review they actually answered different different questions regarding testing but um this this guideline is really uh directed towards towards nucleic acid amplification tests they do not address um the serologic testing but it's it's very good uh the way they they they approach it and there's like a nice algorithm that summarizes uh these these um this guidance from from from idsa and and as i said they're very similar to the general recommendation by both the department of health and and and also uh cdc in general so um look for that for that uh publication the idsa has already published on treatment and and now on diagnosis and also on ppe or or infection prevention and control so they have three useful guidelines um uh already available for everybody to to read and they actually they actually list the respiratory symptoms which is very very similar to and the symptoms very similar to cdc so i'm not going to dwell on that but they even uh describe some of these um you know less usual symptoms like the loss of taste and smell the same as a cdc did in their in the revised guidelines the other uh interesting um news is that uh i heard in a meeting today that rendezvir is going to be available in new mexico apparently they're sending us to this to the whole state uh 400 miles which depending on what application we use it uh it's going to be available so i think i thought it was a good idea to to sort of review what the fda or under what conditions the fda is recommending is used this was these were the inclusion criteria for the for actually for the study of rendezvous that dr faushi um talked about on on on the news because it really has has not been published so they they studied the drug in in patients with more than 18 years of age laboratory confirmed sars and an oxygen saturation of less than 94 or receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and if you look at the fda and the fda also published specific recommendations these are the indications for rendezvous according to the fda uh so you know you have to to have either suspected or laboratory confirmed copy 19 so it can be used in patients of the early on that that are under the you know waiting for for a test result if there's a high clinical suspicion um it's going to be used exclusively in hospitalized patients for now so hospitalized adults and also children so in the evening uh the fda is giving guidance on the dosing for children which i thought it was interesting although there's no experience or too much experience often disavowing children but it's been recommended and the indication is hospitalized adults and children with severe disease and severe this disease is defined by the fda very similar to the falsehood trial with oxygen saturation less than 94 on room air or if they require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation or they are already on on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation so that it's it's pro somewhat lacks um description they the patient do not need to be an icu necessarily so they can be on the general war with receiving oxygen so so at least it's going to be available for you know i would say a significant proportion of the of the hospitalized patient um and then uh there was another interesting publication this was published in lancet uh just a couple of days ago and it's another therapeutic combination this study actually compared uh it was a randomized open label study that compared lopina beer returnability which is calitra is the the drug that that is used for for hiv or an old drug used for hiv a protease inhibitor combined with interference and driver barring and they compare this triple therapy with just kalitra alone uh in 127 patients who were relatively early they have five days from onset of symptom onset and they gave the triple combination to 86 patients and just lopinabe alone to 41 patients and they found differences in in uh in the number of days that patients were symptomatic so it shortened the duration of symptoms as is illustrated by the curve on the on the left so the the red dots and the red line are those treat a patient in the treatment and treatment group they actually improve their their score the severity score um much faster than those who were on the lopino beer alone and the same thing for viral excretion they noticed that there was a faster clearing of the viral shedding in those in the triple combination therapy so so it's an interesting finding obviously this is a relatively small study it's not double blind so it has a lot of methodological uh imperfections but it's it's i think it's moving the field towards towards i think the new the new reality that that if anything we're going to be using combination therapy as opposed to just a single magic bullet we're probably going to end up treating these patients with you know probably rendezvous with with some of the other antivirals in very much as we do with hepatitis c with hiv and many other viral infections so that probably going to require uh multiple drug value i thought it was interesting and interesting publication for those um interested in in healthcare worker infections and protection and ppe the um the analyst of internal medicine published this um nice rapid review they call it a living rapid review of the literature on on how healthcare workers are affected by coronaviruses by severe coronavirus so this is not exclusive of copying my team they actually look at the data for sars and mers and how you know the risk changes when you use a mass when you use ppe so it's a nice review of all the literature with these three uh highly pathogenic coronaviruses and and how some of the things that we do decrease the risk of infection in healthcare workers uh so so it's it's a really interesting review for for those who are um in the field of of infection prevention and it was published on the 5th of may and then there's there's a pre-publication and obviously this this publication has not been peer-reviewed but it was the first large study out of new york of zero conversion or antibody production because most of the most of the information that we have about antibody response and immune response have come from studies done in china but this is a pretty large study over a thousand a thousand three hundred and forty three uh persons who were um would recover from from kobe that were a potential donor for convalescent plasma and they they measure actually their their pcr and they also measure the the antibody production and there were a couple of of interesting finding the first one is that pcr may remain positive and this is something that we have even discussed in this echo comparing the fact that some patients will um remain positive many days and in this study the medium was uh if i remember correctly around 28 days so so a lot of pcr positivity despite an appropriate immune response actually 99 of the patient in this study had antibodies and those antibodies were detected approximately two to three weeks after a symptom initiation so so at least it's reassuring to know that that most of the most of the patients in this cohort um you know produce antibodies so so that was something that we were really in doubt what we don't know yet is if those antibodies are really protected for a second infection that is not determined by this study but this is is reassuring to see that a very high percentage of patients with kobe develop antibodies despite having pcr positivity despite the fact that that they may remain positive in their in their nasopharyngeal and other and other samples um yeah i think and and this is this is a graph illustrating precisely that and on the horizontal axis are the days and the the red bars are those who uh our patients who remain pcr positive and you can see that all the way up to day 28 there were patients still excreting virus despite having an immune an immune reaction or at least screening rna i should say because we don't know if they are uh infective or in uh intact virus or just uh rna material um so i i really encourage you to review this um this trial i think that that's what i i was going to share yeah basically so let me start sharing the and i'm ready to take questions thank you very much that was really informative i also just wanted to let everybody know that we also have carissa colbreath on the line who's with the tri-core the medical director of the lab there and also marla sievers is on who is uh uh embarrasses his epidemiologist in the department of health so we we have we have other people to help nestor out with these questions and i i'm gonna just ask one question that came in through um through our uh pre-questions about the availability of room disavir and i i don't know if marla or anybody can speak to this or nestor you know as everyone read in the paper heard the news today that we were going to get a shipment of destiny today in new mexico and if anyone can speak to if we know where that's going to go and if it's going to be into different hospitals or how that's going to be allocated i think there's several questions about that and marla from the department of health i don't know if you can speak to that at all and then i'll turn it back over to nestor sure i can share what i know um which is that yes new mexico will be receiving a shipment of from deservier my understanding is we're expecting it um at the new mexico department of health pharmacy sometime tomorrow there is a work group um right now of the medical advisory team who is working on recommendations for how that initial limited quantity will be distributed so work is happening right now um to take a look at that a small quantity is being provided um 400 vials so um not not able to treat very many people with that small amount and we are working on some written guidelines that will determine how that's distributed thank you very much maybe inmate i'm sure we'll get more updates on that as time goes on and the more or less i'm going to ask you one question since i have you here already introduced um about the i know that we've also read that you know that new mexico received money from the cdc for enhanced contact tracing and um i can you just talk a little bit about that from the from the department of health standpoint and what that will look like for the for new mexico as a whole sure so we have been doing contact tracing for all cases since the beginning of the covet outbreak in new mexico um with our existing staff and utilizing both just uh telephone calls to people who are contacts as well as a secure text messaging system um so and then working directly with employers so if we have clusters that are related to places of employment working directly with those folks we are trying to hire additional contact tracers currently we've been using existing resources here in idfp our dis from public health division that typically do contact tracing around hiv and sexually transmitted infections so those people have a lot of experience with contact tracing and have been a great addition to the team we currently have about 100 people who are working on contact racing and the intention is to bring more people on board and there's also a new electronic platform that is being deployed to help streamline that process a bit so we expect to be able to do even more than we have been in the near future once we get some additional resources in place thank you very much um joanna can i turn it over to you sure thanks carla hi everybody i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i'm one of the associate directors with dr thornton at project echo it's good to see everybody i'm going to ask a few of the chat questions and then go back to some of the pre-registration questions a question from alan caro is um is for carissa are you are you on the line carissa yes i'm here oh great i don't know if you see dr carroll's question or not in the chat um but he he's interested in the number of known positive and no negative samples that were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a specific covet antibody test the diasaurin antibody test yeah so i would have to defer that question to my colleague david grenache who sometimes joins the call i can check in to see if he would be available to join the call on wednesday to speak of the uh the specifics for that validation okay great and um thanks so much uh carissa um and then um from dr hayes leslie hayes i'm wondering perhaps either carissa perhaps you know this or um marla or nestor do positive antigen tests and positive pcr tests correlate or can one resolve while the other one stays positive um maybe i can at least get started so there was uh one uh antigen test was just approved for emergency use authorization that's the quadell sofia test and based on the package insert when compared to pcr tests the sensitivity of the antigen test is about 80 percent that's eight zero um so not extremely high sensitivity um so just um i i don't know how well we would be able to use those to correlate um and because of that uh sensitivity at 80 the negatives on the antigen test have to be confirmed by a molecular method so that's something to keep in mind if more antigen tests come out to the market and if they start to move to the point of care to take a look at those sensitivities and the limitations that are listed in the package insert thank you carissa extremely thorough you guys are amazing with your responses we have quite experts here i'm gonna um go to these uh pre-registration questions which are also equally a great questions um this is just kind of an open-ended question but also i know is just kind of on everybody's mind right now and is i think a little bit difficult to answer but um perhaps uh either dr sosa or carissa or marla might be able to answer can you comment on how difficult it might be to create an effective coronavirus vaccine compared to other types of viruses that's for me i'll i'll let you start next well at least um i would say um from a theoretical point of view it shouldn't be difficult there are i think last time i checked like 160 candidate vaccines that are being tested right now so you know at least from uh from you know yeah from an experimental point of view it's not difficult to at least come up with ideas and they're testing dna vaccines messenger rna vaccine they're testing uh vaccines antigens are placed into another virus like adenovirus which which are less pathogenic so you give part of the genetic information with another virus attenuated vaccines etc so there's many many um candidate vaccines that are being tested at this point the big question and we don't have the answer is if any of those is going to be immunogenic and if that immunogenicity is going to be protective and also if that vaccine is going to be safe because it could be immunogenic and effective but then may have a you know a not not good safety profile or a bad safety profile and then the final question is if it's going to be scalable if you're going to be able to produce it for the 7.5 billion human beings that are on earth uh so so so all of those questions are really unanswered at this point uh i mean as opposed to and and this vaccine story it's it's something that it's um there are extremes i mean the um if you think about history jenner in in you know 200 years ago was able to develop a vaccine for for smallpox using vaccinia using the the cows pox um and then we and we we have been trying to get a vaccine for hiv for 30 years in the 21st century and we haven't been able to so those are the two extremes a very simple um uh you know scientific model produce a vaccine that was very effective and we are you know 200 years later still struggling with hiv and epstein-barr and many other viruses we have we haven't herpes which we haven't been able to develop a vaccine so you know we just have to wait and see what the how the story unfolds with with this coronavirus sarge ii thank you nestor uh very very helpful um i just wanted to let everybody know that our digital librarian kent did put a um information in the chat about the w.h.o um draft landscape of covet 19 candidate vaccines so that might be very interesting for you all to look at too another question i came in a little bit different but given the high rate of false negatives with regard to rapid testing do you recommend retesting patients who have symptoms and i might add maybe perhaps if so how how often might you retest to if you're if you're at all worried that they might be in fact be positive well i can i can say my uh opinion from the clinician standpoint and looking at the idsa and even cdc recommendations if you have a high a really high clinical or epidemiological suspicion and you have a negative test you can repeat the test i and i i guess the time it's as soon as possible i mean usually you know it takes 24 48 hours to have a to have uh you know the turnaround time so so if you if you have a patient that they say have a lower respiratory infection have been exposed to to kobe uh has a typical clinical or highly suggestive clinical presentation uh fact you have to repeat the test under those condition only if your suspicion is really low um and then the you know the the pre-test probability is really really low then you can you can probably uh be satisfied with a negative with a single negative test but i would say clinically if you if you're suspected you probably have to repeat it especially for hospitalized patients uh patients that are in the icu with respiratory insufficiency et cetera and you think they have copied and you have a negative touch you have to repeat it to make sure hi this is marla the only other thing i'll add is that one of the things that cdc recommends considering in those situations is you might try testing from another site so rather than using an np swab thinking about testing from bal for example thanks marla carissa did you have some something to comment on no that's it i was going to say the exact same thing that marla mentioned we've certainly seen cases where um the patient may be negative in the np sample but is positive in a bal sputum or trach aspirate a chat question came in kind of along the lines in that um one need to know what what factors might contribute to the false negative rates in some of these check tests could it be the person giving the test could it be the you know the sampling what what are some of the things that go into uh contributing to the false negative rate um i think yes to all of the above that are listed um in the uh chat question um sampling is certainly important identifying the patient um well um and a symptomatic patient usually going to give the best specimen um now as a state we've transitioned to testing a lot of asymptomatic patients as they're going into different facilities or procedures um but so so that's just going to increase the possibility of having a false negative just because the patient may not have much virus circulating because they're asymptomatic at that point um sampling techniques certainly is important i've seen some of the i've driven by some of the drive-through specimen collections and many of those are not nasopharyngeal swabs um so a good nasopharyngeal swab right now is the best specimen type in the ambulatory type of patient so we want to try to get those type of specimens um the um so so i think those are certainly factors that contribute to the false negative rate yeah there's also something i like to add the natural history of the disease uh it's that viral setting also decreases with time so if you test the patient after day seven or ten of disease you know they may not be shedding virus anymore although there are people i just mentioned that they are patient that that can shed virus for more than 28 days there are a few who actually clear the viral shedding after seven or ten days so if they're tested on day 12 day 13 of initiation of symptoms they may they may be really negative because they stop shedding in the upper respiratory tract um the the virus thanks nestor carissa marla all great uh all great um discussion points about uh testing um you mentioned i think marla or carissa about the testing uh people if they might even be asymptomatic as they go into different starting to kind of reopen and go into different workplace environments could you speak a little bit more perhaps marla about um the um maybe the the philosophy or what might uh be to come in terms of um the goal of asymptomatic testing there's a question about when will testing be available to anyone who wants a test thinking about asymptomatic carriers but i want to take it even one step further perhaps and ask you all about um you know as we kind of think about in the next several weeks or months about reopening different places of work how you might think about testing sure i'm happy to start but i welcome dr sosa and dr call breath to jump in because i know that they've also put a lot of thought into this um so i think the testing strategy has evolved over time when we had very few tests available and the symptom criteria were different from cdc when we were really focused on people who had traveled or people who were symptomatic you know the testing was very restrictive and since then there's been a move to make testing more and more available i think to a point now where we've really stretched our testing capacity to its limits um and so there as we do move towards resuming um elective procedures for example and opening some places up there is a renewed work underway to incorporate things like these new idsa guidelines and guidance from cdc to help come up with a more cohesive statewide testing strategy that kind of takes into account um testing resources and the competing priorities around who should be tested and coming up with some criteria and so that's you know another bit of work that is underway as we speak with the medical advisory team carissa or nestor i don't know if you have anything to add no i think i think that's that's absolutely right i mean it's it's a difficult decision i mean you there is a reality i mean we have a limit of the number of tests that we can do and also there's a limit to the number of contact tracing and investigation we cannot test everybody you know follow everybody uh um every day and there's another reality if you test let's say an asymptomatic person today let's say a healthcare worker that comes into the hospital today you test them how do you know that he's not infected three or four days on the road are you going to test him every day for the rest of the epidemic so there are some reality checks that we have to we have to be realistic we need to prioritize um in order to to use our our resources even if there are there are a lot of testing capacity it's not infinite so so we have to be rational about it and come up with priorities um and try to see you know which workers are really at a very high risk of acquiring um disease or being positive and what are the consequences of those workers being positive like you know nursing home or or maybe uh people who work in other areas where people congregate as opposed to just a person who works uh in a different environment so so all of those factors i think are gonna come into play when when the state com come up comes up with a with a coherent plan to you know to increase testing but with a with rational um you know boundaries and and taking into consideration a real capacity to to react to those tests thank you all um back to uh carla yeah i think thank you joanna um carissa did you have any other comments about about testing in general no okay um thank you so leslie hayes do you want to un mute yourself and just introduce yourself and ask your question that you asked in the chat and sort of just let us know what you've read about that would be interesting for us sure leslie hayes family physician in espanola and i was reading about um the recent inflammatory syndrome that they're seeing in kids and how many of them actually tested negative although they think it's all due to covid and one of the suggestions was many of the kids actually presented with diarrhea initially and would that be a more sensitive test is testing this stool for um cobit or sarsko v2 thank you very much leslie does anybody have anybody on the panel nester any thoughts no no i i mean except for what i mentioned when we discussed this uh this is a new finding a relatively new finding this uh inflammatory syndrome in kids and and and unless it's right diarrhea was part of the viral symptoms some of these kids and it would be interesting to see if they are they are positive the impression is that this is a late event but we don't know because you know the kids that have been tested uh with the inflammatory syndrome already clear the viral setting so it seems to be like a like an after event or event uh after the initial infection uh but there's still a lot of a lot of information that we don't know about this presentation and i think uh you know surveillance and actually reporting more cases and analyzing larger uh cohorts of of pediatric patient will give us some of those answers there was a nature pace uh paper i think back in march that looked at pediatric presentation of um stars cov2 and looked at nasopharyngeal as well as rectal sampling and found that there was more presence of the virus in the rectal sampling later in disease and so that kind of goes towards this being perhaps a post-infection or kind of post-acute syndrome uh where there's this shedding that's happening um it doesn't appear in some of even the earlier studies that were coming out of china very early in our phase of the of the epidemic it doesn't appear that these are um infectious uh virus particles but more of shedding of the rna that's seen in the stool um so it may be something that we could look at later having to do with these kind of post-acute syndromes great thank you very much um nestor this question is really for you can you just talk about what supportive care looks like for most patients with coven 19. in the hospital or or outpatient well it doesn't um it doesn't actually but i would think that anybody who sort of presents right in the hospital setting and also what you recommend for people going being sent home to monitor their symptoms right yeah in the hospital setting i mean a couple of things obviously um oxygen or or improving the oxygenation if they have hypoxemia is one of the basic things some of these patients initially become dehydrated because they've been at home uh you know with with uh increasing respiratory rates so they have um you know water losses through the respiratory tract so so making sure they are well hydrated um and also some symptom control with with if they have a high fever using antibiotics and that that's that's about it i mean we are including early uh anticoagulation or or or or thrombosis prevention more properly because we know that these patients have an increased risk of having uh you know deep venous thrombosis and thrombotic events uh so so they they are placed on on on a heparin or or or low molecular heparin to to basically prevent the thrombotic events um but that that's about it i mean that that that's really about it what we're doing with them in some hospitals i have seen that they are prone in even non-intubated patients if they have hypoxemia they they give them what it's called the belly time i heard michelle harkins or icu refer to belly time for this non-intubated patient obviously patient with ards they are they are prone frequently as part of a protocol but you can you can ask that to the patients that are not uh intubated um so that that's that's essentially it i mean and then the rest is just consideration of a specific therapy like rendezvous when it's available convalescent plasma um and any severe cases you know in the icu because with with the cytokine storm we are considering two tostilizumab uh as an as an atom um you know therapy for the cytokine storm is a it's an il-6 uh inhibitor and and and it's been used um or it's it's it's been used to try to decrease the cytokine storm and i think at home it's basically the same except for for the the fact that we you know unless the patient have like an oxygen a home australian therapy it would just be mostly monitoring tell them to keep well hydrated telling the the isolation precautions that they have to take in some cases i know that they are giving oxymeter pulse oximeter to the patient to have oximetry in in areas where that can be done otherwise you just give them instruction about what to what to do if they get sicker who to call and when to call thank you very much there was a very a specific question about that what you what do you think of the role of oxygen monitoring oxygen saturation monitoring at home is that um do you have a personal opinion about it mister no no not really i mean i i i think it's a it's another tool but i also the clinical status of the patient the way you know the way their their general status is it's also it's also important thank you and there was one other another question that came up in the chat and what oxygen saturation do you recommend starting oxygen therapy and do you also recommend anticoagulation with aspirin at home uh you know i i would like to defer those questions um to michelle to the critical care because i i really don't don't have that much experience on when to start i know the big and it depends also on what's considered normal oxygen saturation if you live at a high altitude like albuquerque you can probably tolerate you know slightly lower oxygen saturation at a sea level uh but i'm really not an expert on that field so i will i will just skip that and i have seen press releases of the use of aspirin but i haven't seen any any study showing any benefit from from aspirin as a prophylactic it makes sense uh if this patient have hypercoagula will stay but i haven't seen really studies to to give us a solid opinion on the use of of aspirin thank you nestor and another question i'm sure i'm not sure you can answer but there's a question about um what fraction or percentage of admitted patients exhibit uh oxygen saturation drop or hypoxemic when they're um yeah i would pay a pretty high i mean that's one of the criteria to admit a patient i mean it's one of the key criteria uh it's it's hypoxemia or uh or or low uh oxygen saturation or or you know low po2 in a block gas so so i would say the great majority of patients that are meeting unless they have something else uh not respiratory systems but some other complications most of them are admitted because of hypoxemia or or or tachypnea or dyspnea so some manifestation of of of you know of the of the problem with the lung infection great thank you very much um joanna back to you okay um yeah there's a couple uh there's a question um and we've we've heard this a couple of times and um i think the folks at los alamos national labs are looking into it but just a question about the fact that there might be more than one strain of uh covet uh copic 19 or and so someone asked if the virus is mutating or if there might be more than one uh strain wanted to see if um nestor or carissa might want to comment on that yeah i can i can mention something and then uh a compliment by karissa i mean rna virus in general um when they replicate their rna they have an rna polymerase that doesn't have an editing enzyme as as our dna human dna or or mammal dna polymerases usually correct mistakes um rna polymerases in general uh most of these viruses they when they copy their rna they may be errors so so there's always that change in the in the rna that can occur uh with every progeny of of virus or every every time there's a replicating cycle of the virus most of these mutations are are not beneficial or or detrimental to the virus so they are really irrelevant there are some mutations that can somehow change the critical proteins of the virus and may increase or decrease their viral fitness their ability to cause disease with carbon 19 and with with coronaviruses uh in particular there is this tendency to change when they are circulating in human population there are mutations that that are selected out and and in fact the work that joanna was referring to the work by the by the los alamos national laboratory they actually found that there is a specific mutation that have been uh that it's been uh becoming the most the most common virus uh in every in every area which had been introduced so so there was this initial wuhan wild type virus that that disseminated and then there's this new um strain of of the virus that they have acquired this mutation and this seems to be more effective in transmission because it becomes a dominant strain in some of the communities not enough not in all communities but in the great majority of communities so so um as soon as we see something like that we ask you know if if is this mutation helping the virus in some way is it helping escape the immune system is is it helping um infect more readily the cells the human cells and and those type of things so so it is occurring uh and and it will will occur over time this this uh genetic drift uh of of the virus or antigenic drift and something similar to what happens with with the influenza there's always like a you know constant change in the influenza in influenza we see some radical changes once in a while and that explains the pandemics with influenza with this virus is more like a drift um that that is accumulating different mutations so so yes and and i've seen multiple studies from geneticists that are studying these viruses and they are discovering these changes but as i said some of these changes are irrelevant i mean they don't change the natural history they don't change the immunogenicity uh because they are mutations in areas which are not critical for viral replication other mutations are more critical especially the spike protein the nuclear protein um and it can change the the the the infectious uh character of the virus or even the response to drugs et cetera when we use raindensity and other drugs in large scale we're probably serious to be resistant mutants occur and that happens with you know all of the virus that we have deal in the past um the only thing that i may add is that um sometimes paired with the question about mutation is whether or not that'll affect the ability for the test to be able to detect the virus um and so all of the molecular tests that are currently on the market are two target assays um so they target two different regions of the virus and part of the reason why that happened was because we didn't know how mutable the virus was going to be and where there may be emerging mutations and so the fda required that there would be at least two targets that would be detected in many of the assays we can actually distinguish which of the two targets which are both of the targets are detected by the assay um and so in routine laboratory monitoring we would be able to see if one particular target began to drop off that would let us know something is changing in the region of the virus where the assay is detecting but we would still be able to see that other portion of the virus would would be there and we would see it as detected as positive so that's something we can see in the back end in the laboratory and then i think the other thing that is maybe comforting in that area is that most laboratories across the country are running several different assays to try to keep up with the volume and so that leads to overlap in uh the different targets that are detected and um there's open reading frame there's nuclear capsule there's spike there's aging there's so many different targets that many assays are looking at different areas and most laboratories are running several different tests so we would be able to move and transition to a different assay if one appeared to be losing sensitivity because of a mutation that could be emerging in the virus that was very helpful nestor and carissa and it seems like you're both feeling uh not too worried that a mutation might not make it more difficult to find a vaccine that works either that's what it seems like what i've been hearing throughout some of your answers today as well so that that's that's positive um you're muted there was a question from dr singleton tamara singleton um regarding uh blood type a and i remember dr sosa many many weeks ago when there was some early study showing that people with blood type a might have a more difficult course and i'm wondering what if there's been any new new data now regarding that no i haven't seen any any of that and and for those who are not here what we uh what i read if i remember correctly because it was like many many weeks ago uh it was uh in in some of the chinese retrospective studies they found that the number of patients or the percentage of patients with type a in icu and critically ill was higher than the general population so it was an observation in retrospective reviews of patients that for some reason um you know in china people who were type a were overrepresented in the hospital with kobe uh as opposed to the general population but nothing to explain the the you know mechanistically how or why this is happening i i i haven't really seen any any any clear explanation for that it was it was more of an epidemiological observation retrospective observation but interesting nevertheless so so dr sosa would you so you wouldn't necessarily check a blood type um when they come it when a patient with covet can come to the hospital necessarily no i haven't i haven't seen that indicated in any in any in any protocol i guess and and it's not that o or a b are not affected it's just that you know percentage wise uh the a seems to be overrepresented but you can have o and have very severe disease uh or a b and have very severe disease so it probably doesn't have that much of a clinical value it's just more to find the interesting thing is to try to find why that that is happening and it will give you a clue on the on the you know pathophysiology or or some type of intervention that you can do to improve those videos thanks mister um i'm wondering and perhaps marla might have some answers to this tonight and i might be able to help with this question too is um gladys marquez from albuquerque asked what is the risk to emts and ambulance drivers in albuquerque regarding getting infect infected um from covid um as they as they work since they are um definitely first first responders marla do you um do you have any data on um emts or paramedics or even police officers around the country regarding infection from covid um i'm not sure i've seen any um anything published specifically around first responders yet i know there is some um early guidance that's been released and we've been working um closely through our ems bureau with first responders just to provide um you know guidance around common sense um approaches to infection prevention um and so all first responders are now universal masking um when they are interacting with a patient out on a call that person is being given a mask immediately uh regardless of what the call is about um so not only masking people where there might have been a call for someone for respiratory problems but really masking all patients that they're interacting with i think for ems obviously a big risk for them is a cpr it's an aerosol generating procedure um and doing that out in the field um you have optimal um you know ppe available or time to don it and so i think that obviously is a risk to that group that they're aware of and you know we're in constant discussions with them and their employee health and occupational medicine representatives about how better to protect those groups so i think there are some definite recognized risks for them based upon the care that they're providing thank you marla that that's very helpful i also wanted to let um let people know we do have a first responder resiliency echo and many first responders participate in that and the doh first first responder bureau trip gave us a couple of really good talks to the first responders about um safety regarding uh covent it was very very helpful um i did want to let um people know dr caro was very generous and he emailed me um information regarding coursera has a a free six-hour online course for anybody in the country who wants to take a course to become a contact tracer um and it's available now as of um today as of may 11th and i'm wondering doctor crow if you want to put the information in the chat i think that would be really awesome so thank you dr caro the cme web link should be up soon i'm going to pass it back to carla um as well right now thank you joanna i guess i would just ask in terms of contract tracing um i don't know if marla if you can speak to this but i i think that is all being coordinated from the department of health i don't know if they're hiring people outside of the um employees that you already have can you speak to that i was thinking more for for other states i mean more being it's a more national effort this was coming out of john's johns hopkins goddess new york and new jersey the northeast sector i think is doing a big push so i can't speak for new mexico maybe marla could um i can say a lot of hiring is being coordinated for contact racing through cdc foundation and um with the idea that that people will be deployed to all 50 states excellent thank you um and there's been a couple of um questions come up in the chat about vitamin d i don't know if uh nestor if you can speak to that there's been what's the scoop on vitamin d and covid and are we looking at vitamin d levels in hospitalized patients no i i mean i've seen an article but to be honest with you i didn't read it in in detail i know they have found low levels of vitamin d in some of the severely ill copic patients but that's as far as i can say i haven't really seen it as a therapeutic uh strategy or or screening uh test i i cannot i cannot say uh anything about that just as as an as an aside um i was just seeing there's some retrospective data very preliminary data on sync we know that sync is used for common call and it's from evidence and for the first time i i saw a couple of hours ago an article on on the pre pre-peer review databases talking about the use of of of sync as a as a potential uh therapeutic strategy so that was interesting but i haven't seen anything on vitamin d and i apologize no problem there's an interesting question um from gladys marcus in albuquerque the death says the deaths of all said the deaths all say underlying medical conditions what are those and i think this is more of a question i don't know if marla from a from new mexico standpoint if we have uh any data on whether the underlying medical conditions are different than what we what's being seen nationally internationally that the predispose people to severe disease do we keep do you know anything about the new mexico data specifically i don't know that we've done a drill down on that level yet for those underlying conditions you know i can just say sort of from my own experience working with cases and looking at death reports um they're pretty typical of you know what you're hearing out of other states so people who have diabetes people who are obese people who have chronic lung disease uh chronic you know heart disease hypertension um you know so kind of those chronic condition comorbidities that are being found in other states as well but i don't think we've done any formal analysis on that yet thank you marla and there was some data that came out that i saw this morning actually about obesity being a very important um comorbid condition in patients who are younger so that may look a little bit different in patients who who are younger age i don't know if nestor if you had anything else to say about underlying co-morbid conditions no there was a question in the in the chat then marla already addressed it about obesity the obesity is a it's a risk factor that we have appreciated here in the united states more than in china and obviously some of our minorities um they they have uh you know higher prevalence of obesity so so that compounds the the the problem in in in those groups great thank you very much and i i don't know if jenna if you mentioned this but i wanted to say that the cme um link went into the chat a couple of minutes ago so if people want to see me please fill that out and give us feedback and we'd like to hear anything any input that you have that you have so i think we have time for maybe one more question i was seeing if there was any last minute questions in the chat um let's see there's a lot of questions about the antibody test and i think carissa mentioned you know that she the about the antibodies test at tricor and how the antibody test is being used but we'll see if um uh dr grenache can come on possibly next monday chris says there's no no more wednesday coven 19 office hours i just wanted to announce that for those of you who haven't been on in a while um in addition uh we have several other interesting um coveted 19 echoes uh one on thursday morning which is from eight to nine with michelle harkins who's director of our clinical uh critical care and pulmonary department here and um joanna like i don't remember the the topic for for thursday if you can go ahead and bring you can go ahead and talk about that yeah i i i um i know that dr harkins plans to have a case every thursday to talk about a different kind of critical care issue rebecca garcia might um might be able to type that in or us or share with us the the topic for this uh for this thursday but i have i have forgotten that topic split split my mind but i can tell you for friday the covet echo on friday for which uh nestor and marla are part of as well as michelle harkins and megan brett um the talk is going to be about the cdc clinical call center and we might also have a short talk about palliative care and what's happening um in the gallup navajo nation area as well as a a case from a palliative care case from the gallup area as well on friday and rebecca garcia says that the talk on friday and michelle harkin's critical care echo is on cardiovascular implications for covid19 excellent thank you thank you joanna um and also uh john i don't know if you want to mention the first responder echo as well sure the first responder echo is on every monday it's from two to three mountain times so it's today um we're going through many uh it's for all first responders so not only paramedics and firefighters but physicians nurse practitioners pas respiratory therapists nurses m.a psychologists anyone really who's working on the front lines with the covet pandemic um and we're going through um kind of psychological first aid really how to take care of your team how to take care of yourself um and uh kind of uh we have cases a lot of questions and answers and we've got many subject matter experts so that's two to three mountain time on mondays thanks carla yeah thank you and lastly i'll just mention um that our website has a lot of good information on if you want to go and look for other resources on the website also any health care providers and health department staff that with with questions about coven 19 can access the cdc clinical call center 24 hours a day i'm in that number 770-488-7100 and that's on our website as well and in addition just to mention um the um the talk next week on our covet echo on friday is going to be the woman who's directing that call center from the cdc so she'll be able to answer questions and i don't know yeah debbie dowell is going to meet debbie dowd will be the speaker on that tele echo all right so one minute left we'll let you have that minute back and we really appreciate everyone coming on today thank you nestor and marla and carissa for your participation and please come come to any other echoes or we'll see you next monday you,,5/11/2020
6,hi good afternoon everyone welcome to the echo uh clinical coven 19 office hours with dr sosa we're very excited to see everybody my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm and i'm one of the associate directors at project echo and i'll be helping to facilitate the session along with dr matt bouchonville who is an endocrinologist here and another another one of the associate directors at echo and when he when he comes on for the first time we'll let him introduce himself as well so just a couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started um as you guys all know and we've said over and over again we really love to build community with project echo so we love to see people's faces and if you have a camera please turn on your camera if you can um we also um would would love to have you chat any questions that you have into the chat box so we did receive some questions received some questions in the pre-registration but we would love to hear from you during the session as well so if you have a question please refrain from from unmuting yourself but just put it into the chat box and we'll try to get to your question as well um during the session uh the our digital library librarian kent norrisworthy will be putting resources into that into the chat box continually through that so so please keep keep an eye on that and if you want to uh click on those links or copy and paste them you're welcome to do either one of those things as well we also have a lot of resources on our website so if you want to check that out after this session that would be great as well and also just note that there's a new version of zoom available and if you haven't updated lately please do that because the other one was basically just going to go away so you have to update your zoom to continue using zoom and i believe that ken he's putting it right into the chat as we speak so if you haven't updated your zoom recently please do that so i'd like to go ahead and get started with the session we have a many of you may remember david grenache came on i think about a month ago and gave us a little bit of an update about um and covet 19 antibody testing and there were a lot of there have been a lot of questions about that recently on all of our echoes so i asked david if he could come back on today and he can only be here for the very first part of the session so i'm going to have him actually uh go ahead and give us what updates he has from um from his perspective and david is a as the medical director of the core laboratory at tricorn david i'll let you introduce yourself and and um give us whatever information you possibly can that will help us sure sure hi carl hi everyone thanks for letting me pop in um so we did we started tri core started offering um an antibody test to the novel coronavirus uh two weeks ago today um we spent about a month uh evaluating the accuracy and performance of the test uh it's made by a company called diasoren uh they're an italian company we have worked with them for years we do other tests that they manufacture they're known for making high quality serological tests as well as high quality endocrine tests so we were very uh satisfied with the performance of the covid antibody test and like i said we started offering it two weeks ago they would as you probably all know there was incredible interest and somewhat some hype around antibody testing so we expected to see a large volume of test requests right as soon as we opened up the floodgates but we did a lot of messaging about how to use these tests appropriately what their limitations were and i think people heard us we have not had a lot of test requests which simultaneously makes me happy and makes me a little nervous too because you get to buy a lot of tests in advance um so we're doing now about uh 40 tests a day we've done around 500 um antibody tests and since the last two weeks and we have about right now a four percent positivity rate about uh 20 samples have been have been positive now keep in mind that you know this isn't a general sampling of the population uh it's hard for us to know in the lab why a particular test was ordered but some of the test requests have come from hospitals but many of them have come from an outpatient setting so it's again it's difficult to know why a particular test was ordered but we haven't seen a really strong demand for the test right now as well that might change in the future and we're prepared to ramp up capacity if needed so that's my update um happy to take any questions great thank you so much david um i do have a one question for you uh um so when you when the test is ordered you get both igm and igg oh good question no uh it is actually only an igg test uh uh it does not detect igm and we purposely uh decided to go with an igg only test uh for a couple reasons uh the first is that all of the emerging data that came out of several weeks ago and is still coming out now i demonstrate that the the interval of time for seroconversion between igm and igg for this disease is for this virus is very brief it's on the order of a few days so we didn't see a whole lot of value in um offering a test that also detected an early serologic marker like igm but probably the more important reason is that um igm assays are notoriously uh difficult in terms of specificity because igm is an early marker of infection it doesn't often have those antibodies don't necessarily have high affinity for the antigens and there's some amount of cross reactivity and we were concerned about the effect that that would have on the uh analytical specificity of the assay so we opted for just igg excellent thank you so much there are a couple of questions that came in through the chat um the first one was do you think testing should be widely available to the public as in self-testing and what are the pros and cons of an approach like this right i don't think right now no i don't i'm not supportive of that type of approach the fda hasn't approved any tests for any antibody test for home use at the moment um and until we know more about the immune response and whether or not these antibodies are protective although it's starting to look like they probably are um there's probably not a need for widespread testing for for clinical purposes i think last time i was on we talked about how important this type of testing is for um prevalence uh for sero prevalence studies to see you know how widely maybe the infection was throughout the community uh when we know that there are uh quite a few asymptomatic individuals but from a an individual patient perspective still not a whole lot of value thank you very much and there's a couple questions just about the false positivity and sensitivity and specificity of the test and then i know you mentioned this but what lab uh is it available for there's a question from nancy brooker i don't know nancy if you want to enter oh there you are go ahead and meet yourself and ask and ask your question about specifically about which lab you know what nancy it looks like we don't have um you don't have a mic we can't hear you even though you're unmuted sorry about that okay i'll read your question again it says what is the sensitivities let's just do the test that's the first question and then it says what lab is it available from i don't know if that means what you you know what you you mentioned where the lab where your test is coming from if you can get it i like to i'll answer the second part first so the test is performed here at tricor at our reference lab in albuquerque um as i said the manufacturer's uh uh diasoren that's d-i-a-s-o-r-i-n uh the sensitive so the manuf the manufacturer in their uh deosorin states their own sensitivity and specificity in their um product insert um sensitivity i think from my memory uh was on the order of 98 or 99 and specificity was like 99.3 but and then we did our own experiments with a much smaller sample set and we demonstrated that sensitivity was uh nearly a hundred percent like 99 when sample when serum samples were collected 14 or more days after a positive pcr and that makes sense you know from the immune response you know it takes time for antibodies to be produced and we didn't have access to um clinical symptoms from the sam from the individuals whose blood we tested so i couldn't i couldn't calculate sensitivity back to the onset of symptoms i had to use a positive pcr test as my sentinel event um and the and this and the closer samples were the the the closer in time that blood samples were collected relative to a positive pcr the less positive the less likely it was they were to be positive but once we got to 14 days or longer after the positive viral test the the nasal pharyngeal swab test samples were uniformly positive and then we were able to test samples that were collected prior to the pandemic from individuals who were known to have been infected with other coronaviruses not the novel coronavirus as well as other respiratory viruses uh to evaluate the specificity uh and those were uniformly negative 100 were negative now there no test is perfect there are going to be false positive and false negative results now that we're offering the test clinically without access to a lot of information about the samples we get it's difficult to know but also you all know too that uh prevalence affects um uh you know the performance of a test and so if the prevalence of antibodies in the population is very low or in the or the population being tested is low uh then it's more likely that a positive test is like is more likely to be a false positive and false positives uh are the false positive rate decreases as the prevalence of the uh disease increases so keep that in mind too thank you so much yeah there are a couple of questions um that were that actually were sent in and also on the chat about positive predictive value but i know you can only calculate that when you have know the prevalence in the population right so the question is what is the positive to predictive value given the the the low prevalence yeah that's a great question so if if we take the information that was in the product insert about sensitivity and specificity uh and we we can calculate the predictive values based upon you know estimated prevalence at a prevalence of one percent um the positive p predicted value is 50 so you might as well flip a coin uh but the positive predictive value increases to i think off the top of my head it was around 87 percent if the prevalence was 5 so it doesn't take a big increase in prevalence for the positive predictive value to jump up perfect thank you so much um one other question do you have time for another one david um what role if any do you see in using the antibody test as part of a testing regimen for certain populations such as college students returning to campus yeah we get this question a lot too um it's not only from schools but from businesses that want to use antibody testing to help guide return to work practices or return to school practices at this point in time all we can say is that a positive antibody result indicates you've had the infection in the past and we all want to believe that it makes you immune from reinfection but but we don't know uh quite yet so i think we i don't think we should read a whole lot right now into a positive antibody response and i certainly wouldn't use them to um to indicate to a person well you're at less risk and you should go back to work without personal protective equipment or whatever social distancing or whatever you have to do same goes with school but i will point out that you know we're starting to use convalescent plasma uh to treat critically ill patients and it seems to be working in the future some of the data that i've seen so clearly there's some protective reasons there's some benefit beneficial response of these antibodies whether or not they are protect you from reinfection or help ameliorate um symptoms is uh isn't really exactly clear but you know it's logic tells us that you know there should be some amount of protectivity with these antibodies but until their definitive data i think i would be really cautious thank you that's super helpful and there's actually one question that came in um before that didn't come in on the chat but it was very specific about what are the icd-10 codes for covid19 antibody test or how and if people would would be charged for the test i don't know if you know those answers david yeah no i i was kind of fearing i was going to get that question because i don't know the i don't know the answer you know i think it's not clear you know uh we've all been told repeatedly that you know uh virus tests for for code that are are not charged the patient and that's been true uh for the virus test it's not i'm not clear about the antibody tests um so i don't have an answer for you i carl i can find one and email you my response that would be great we can send that out and we could actually just put it on on the website too as a resource okay okay and i know you can only stay for the first 15 minutes so david we really appreciate you being here and um please join us at any time i don't know if you had any if you had any specific questions for david before he no no thank you very much thank you for for helping us thanks sure it's always a pleasure it's nice to see you guys great thank you so much david all right take care before we leave the um the antibody testing question actually i wanted to um fred fox can you do you mind just putting what you put into the channel just to talk about that a little bit more from the public health perspective and just introduce yourself before you before you speak as well yeah my name is fred fox can you hear me okay yes we can are you hearing me all right yes we can hear you oh maybe he can hear us um fred you're muted there try that again how's that working good okay all right i'm a family physician in silver city most of what i do now is public health i'm medical director of the greenlee county arizona public health department my comment is about where i think the real value in antibody tests are serology testing at least in the rapid test is in the field in areas that are more remote or rural we've used them in arizona or at least we did until the fda said you had to be high complexity lab and found them useful in case contact tracing where there's a higher pre-test probability the positive predictive value is going to be reasonable and it's real useful when you're in the field fred we're having a lot of difficulty hearing you i think maybe if you turn your video off it might help just a little bit and then otherwise we'll just have people read what you said in the chat i'm sorry turn what off you're if you turn your video off you might be able to okay thank you fred okay does that help yeah that's better okay oh can't repeat it all but i think the value is in contact tracing in rural areas where there's a pre higher pre pass probability and out in the field of rap and i test to make relational quarantine am i yeah thank you fred can you really break it up so yeah not really sorry about that so we'll i just we can just people can also just look at the chat but thank you for for sharing that we're just having a hard time hearing you um you're breaking up a lot so okay thank you friend so i'm gonna move on until doctor oh okay thank you fred um to dr nestor sosa who's the chief of infectious diseases here at unm um he can introduce himself and he actually has a couple of slides he wanted to share a few updates with us before we go uh into more questions so rebecca can you share an esther slides and nestor please enjoy thank you yeah my name is nacho salsa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm uh just a comment before i go into my slides about fred the only the only uh issue with serologic testing and contract tracing is that the positivity of the test really goes up after the 14 day days of disease so so it's not positive early on so you may miss people who have just been infected and and they are in the first you know three or four days of the incubation period or or even if they already been infected but they have not mounted an antibody response you may not be able to diagnose them with the with the serology test so that that's that's what some institutions are actually still advocating for a pcr test because the pcr become positive really early i mean i've seen papers that up to three to five days you're already having positive pcr as opposed to antibodies we usually take more than a week and and really to to to to see those sensitivities around 90 98 that dr grenache was mentioning you need two weeks uh from from the from either from the symptoms onset or or from the testing okay so let's go so what i did i actually because we haven't really had a chance to review the literature in the last week there are a couple of interesting papers that came up the last few weeks i'm just going to summarize it with one one slide from from each paper really quickly can i have the next slide so the hydroxyl plural queen doesn't seem to go away i mean i every every couple of days i see a publication uh because we use it a lot at the beginning of the epidemic and people are still looking for for some evidence of efficacy and this was one of the most recent um papers on hydroxychloroquine um they actually uh compare hydroxychromium with no hydroxychloroquine and the two grafts that you'll see in one um it's a comparison of these two group a standard of care or a standard of carbohydrate chloroquine and the impact of this treatment on on the alleviation of symptoms and as you can clearly see there was no difference between the two groups so so hydroxycurrent in this specific open label randomized control trial didn't do uh any any it didn't make any difference and the same from from the from the biologic point from the point of of positive pcr which is one one of the things that the the group part of mars sage uh that uh in famous study of the sixth patient that actually cleared the virus earlier with hydroxychloroquine acidromycin in this study with only a hydrosichloroquine um there was no difference in the pcr positivity uh you know going forward if you receive or not the hydroxyl chloroplane so it's another negative study we still don't know if given the the drop even earlier um makes a difference um but but it's it's one more uh you know piece of the puzzle uh speaking against the activity uh at least in vivo in humans of something that worked in vitro next slide the other drug that we have heard some and and i have actually answered several questions is the the il-6 inhibitor as you know patients with with kobe 19 especially those on icu are very severely ill developed this cytokine storm and one of the most important cytokines that is thought to be the director of the orchestra is il-6 or interleukin-6 so it makes sense to use tosilisima as an antidote for this cytokine storm and you know we're starting to see publications there are two publications over the weekend uh from italy uh and interestingly enough one publication showed no difference no benefit of two citizens and the other found a dramatic uh decreasing mortality so i think at the end we either need a randomized study or we need a meta-analysis that actually summarizes these results and give us some more data this first story was out of the group that kobe 19 registry group in in italy and and they actually look only at 21 patients that receive um the tosilisiumab and they they couldn't really see any any difference or any benefit uh in that in that small slowly next another study also from italy with a little bit more patience this was a comparison of two silicon map versus noticeable issue map and and actually they get to selection up to 262 patients and and they use 23 a match control this is a sort of a treatment control are not not really a randomized double blind but actually a retrospective analysis and they did find a survival uh benefit from two silicon maps so so at least this this study did show some uh clinical benefit this totally was larger than the one before so i would say have more weight um in the in in in favor of to selection up so it's something that we're going to keep following and see if there's a a large randomized trial that that can tell us more but at least it's hopeful to see that that this antidote to the cytoconstruction seems to be improving survival in some of the patients next the other the other interesting uh paper that i saw is a really small paper but it answers some of the questions that have been asked in this chat or in this in this sessions um it's about the prone and and these these researchers actually did some physiologic studies on patients not on non-invasive ventilation so this were patient not on mechanical ventilation but receiving non-invasive ventilation and they prone these 10 patients and they measure their oxygen saturation the the pao2 fio2 trend and the respiratory rate and in general they found that while there were pruning patients improved both objectively and subjectively they feel felt better they they have less uh of the kidney or respiratory rate went down um and also the the oxygenation improved at least for some of the patients uh transiently so so there was there's definitely evidence of of some uh beneficial effects of this prone several times a day uh and and um and it's something that had been you know not really being studied only in ventilated patients but now there's some evidence that the non-ventilated pension patients can also work next slide that's interesting for those who like uh physiology i also receive a question i think it was a couple of weeks ago on on levels of vitamin d or vitamin d and and kobe 19 and i saw this story out of um i think it was switzerland in which they actually measured the levels of vitamin d in patients with copied 19 and compared to their population studies done in 2019 and to uh to a sample of non-copy patients um also from 2020 from this year and there was a statistically significant difference in the levels of vitamin d and those who are affected with copy than those who were not copic patients so there seems to be something to that observation that patients apparently with low vitamin d are more susceptible to to the severe manifestations of kobe 19 obviously the the the natural conclusion is can we use vitamin d to prevent the most severe forms or or to decrease or ameliorate the severity of kobe we don't know we need to do a prospective trial this this was actually a retrospective uh looking to into vitamin d levels and and and kobe uh versus known comic basis so interesting we were starting to see some something uh regarding uh these these um nutritional uh supplements and and some difference with with uh with kobe next and the other story that i think i found striking as you know spain was one of the countries with probably one of the highest mortality and highest number of cases so they did a really well designed large really large sort of prevalent study they tested actually more than 70 000 people in 36 homes or households uh throughout spain to try to to ascertain or to or to find the prevalence of the of copying 19 and they found actually that only five percent of the population had actually antibodies so so this is extremely low i mean it's high if you compare with other places where they have not had any epidemic at all but it's slow if we if we think of hurt immunity because remember that we were we have discussed this uh you know that ideally if you get the epidemic to affect a significant number of the population you will not um i mean you will be able to to extinguish the epidemic by just having too many uh immune individuals unfortunately um in this study in spain a country really affected like the us italy and and wuhan in china the prevalent doesn't seem to be very high it's only five percent obviously not enough to to get hurt immunity i have some publication that that state that you need uh around eighty percent or seventy percent of the population to be affected to actually have this this uh her immunity and and and break the epidemic without a vaccine so so it was interesting it's a really well designed study really representative of the spanish population and only five percent prevalence um uh in in europe next slide uh the other the other uh important information i think we have mentioned this but i reiterate the cdc have published some guidance on on the on this multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome in children there's actually a case definition so i refer you to the cdc i don't expect you to read this slide but they have a case definition and when you should suspect this and how to to do the surveillance of this multisystem inflammatory syndrome that it's been really rare i mean we have you know a handful of cases in the us and and a few in the uk uh but it's it's also you know really severe devastating for some kids so it's interesting to to be on the look for that and report it to the health authorities and to the cdc so we can really um learn more from what's going on with this with this uh multi-system inflammatory syndrome next i think my final slide and and something of a different uh flavor actually i i found this uh graph in a in a in a journal called the journal of medical internet research this uh journal usually you know uh uses the internet to do research and they actually look at the twitter uh feeds from all over the world i mean this is a global study on what were the words used um in twitter um throughout the this pandemic and and and you can see the the highest at the beginning of the epidemic fear was the highest uh sentiment or feeling that was dominating twitter and as the epidemic evolved and more you know knowledge was acquired actually fear diminished towards the middle of march but then things like anger and and surprisingly joy also increase i don't know if joy of being at home or something but it's interesting i invite you to read this this this article and and how people are are using twitter and and they use uh artificial intelligence to actually measure uh you know global feeling of you know it it's sort of interesting but logical how people at the beginning of the epidemic there was a lot of uncertainty a lot of fear and now that has decreased somewhat and it's sort of tied with with anger and joy um i think that was the last one uh in my review so we'll take questions now thank you thank you so much nestor um i want to go ahead and turn it over to my colleague matt bush unveil medic you can just formally introduce yourself again and we can start with the questions that would be great and p please everyone uh continue to send uh your questions and through the chat all right thanks carla and um let's see oh i'm matt bachando i'm a hormone specialist diabetes provider and one of the associate directors of project echo so good to see you all dr sosa you were alluding to the presentation and children and we have a couple of questions i'm going to lump together with respect to coveted children so one question is from nadia faisal here in albuquerque um can you discuss the incidents of covid in children in new mexico and then deborah rocky um is asking if you could also comment on uh testing implications in children and any difference in the testing we should be ordering in children right thank you well first of all a disclaimer i'm not a pediatrician and i haven't really followed the literature on pediatrics uh you know very closely but i know that that the incidence of of combinating kids in new mexico have been higher than in some other areas of the country that that's as much as i can as i can say and as far as i know the testing is the same i mean you try to find the rna of the virus in the respiratory secretions nasal and nasopharynx children but i really that's that's all i'm going to say if there is a pediatrician that that knows more than i do i really appreciate the if they can if they can comment but that's uh that's a phenomenon that we have seen here in new mexico the fact that that a higher proportion of children have been detected with with kobe 19 and in general just to review the general knowledge i mean children seems to be um to have a less severe disease and a lot of children have asymptomatic children and young adults have asymptomatic infection um there are there are some evidence that they are effective transmitters of the disease so some publications actually um said that that that actually children shed the virus and can infect other but they're not that affected uh ex with the exception of this obvious late apparently complication of this multi system which is really as i said not very frequent uh but it's it's somewhat dramatic because some of these kids present with with hypotension with shock with really severe um and they have been death associated with this multi inflammatory syndrome [Music] all right thank you next question is from roxanne grajeda from las cruces so is a person still infectious after completing 28 days of isolation and then retesting positive and roxanne i'm gonna combine your questions it sounds like this is an asymptomatic patient and their cardiologist won't see them until they uh until they test negative so what would your suggestion be in that setting right i think that's one of the probably hardest question at this moment in in both in the press and in the scientific communities um because we're seeing a very frequent phenomenon and it's the following people who who came were diagnosed with coffee for some reason they they became negative and then they test positive again we're seeing it with the sailors uh that have been reported in the news and we've seen in the in patients in nursing homes and even healthcare workers and and many others that have been tested they they actually recover clinically from the disease they may even have an interim negative test and if for some reason they're tested again let's say two three four weeks after the illness some of them have a positive test and we don't really know what the meaning of that is and we have discussed this what the the pcr test just detects rna is very sensitive and it detects the presence of rna of the virus but it is not equal to detecting uh infected by virions or intact variants so we don't really know i think we need more epidemiological studies to tell us if if these patients who have recovered and are setting rna are infectious or not and i haven't seen a publication of that uh uh that clarifies that question and that question is tied to the immunity because we know that people may be shedding this rna in their nasal or bronchial secretions and at the same time if you draw their blood they will have a positive serology test because the tests become positive after 14 days so how do you um you know how do you discern if they if they have antibodies but at the same time they have a positive pcr that's that's the issue here we still don't know for sure uh if that is just residual rna non-infectious virus you know with 100 certainty and and on the other hand we don't know if those antibodies are actually 100 protective um so so it's still an open question and i think it's one of the most interesting research area at this point with these uh viruses and it's crucial to know those answers uh in order to reopen businesses to reopen the economy to go back to work uh and believe me we get questions uh uh unm on a daily basis some you know persons on this situation you know this person wants to go back to work but he's testing positive he's been well for 28 days he recovered from his coffee uh and and we have this uh in a difficult uh situation all right thank you and there were a couple of questions alluding to the the sailors but you just alluded to that as well the uh in terms of reinfection so thank you dr sosa right let me just let me just add something mad about the sailors i think uh there are two questions in that and the way i see it one is uh are they being reinfected i mean they did they actually recover and and acquire the infection for a second time or is this this is just intermittent shedding and i use the analogy of epstein-barr the virus that causes mononucleosis once you get mono you excrete intermittently abstaining bar for the rest of your life yeah for the rest of your life very high levels for the first 18 months but then if you culture uh somebody uh or do pcr for for epstein bar in in the saliva of a person you have mono you can find it intermittently even years after they have the disease so are we seeing the same phenomenon with with with kobe 19 that you you end up screening intermittently is that excretion infectious we don't know um there's a simple or relatively simple way to to try to to determine if it's a reinfection and it's doing a genetic analysis of the virus the second time around if you have the virus that infected the first time and you have the second uh infection you can actually do you know deep genetic comparison between virus one and virus two and see if they're different if they have a lot of uh difference in mutation and you can you can argue that it's a reinfection if they are identical it's probably just a reactivation but it's something that we still wait we need to wait for the studies uh that are going to be done on these sailors and other and others in the same situation to come up with a with a with a good answer very interesting thank you nestor and um i wonder if you can comment on uh any updates with respect to a vaccine this is a question from maria martinez in las cruces yeah thank you i think that the most newsworthy uh event was that moderna which is one of the leading uh companies working on on on vaccines that has the the approval and support of the federal government they're working on an mrna vaccine or messenger rna vaccine which is a completely innovative i think there's no vaccine commercially available with that technology using mrna and they actually demonstrated in a very small number of of patients or subjects they actually gave the vaccine to eight patients and they found that they produce antibodies and and actually the company communicated that in a news release this is not an article it's not a scientific article it's just a communication that that at least that first step that their vaccine was immunogenic in eight volunteers uh it's encouraging because it's probably one of the first time that we use mrna vaccine and it's actually um able to produce um antibodies and the idea is that the iron mrna or messenger rna is actually what promotes the synthesis of proteins so we're not even vaccinating the patients with the protein of the virus we actually vaccinating uh subjects with with uh with the predecessor of the protein which is the messenger rna so it was interesting to see that that that messenger messenger rna actually produced viral proteins and those viral proteins were recognized by the immune system and the immune system produce antibodies against that those backs and and they are measurable in the lab so they're gonna they're gonna keep moving with this uh candida vaccine uh and they're gonna continue their research they're gonna enroll 600 patients in the next uh phase which is the phase two uh of the of these uh that's i think the most noteworthy issue with the with the vaccine all right thank you back to you carla thank you matt um nestor i just want to go back to the sailor story one more time because i think that somebody put in the chat that the you know they actually tested negative and then they tested positive again right i don't know if you you talked about that but it seems a little bit different than the ones we've been hearing about over in this network who are just persistently positive i don't know if it means anything different but i don't know what your take on that is right i i mean i don't think we know i mean until we know if they were reinfected with a different strain of the virus or this is just intermittent vital setting um we don't know the meaning we don't know really the meaning and and if i remember correctly a lot of these sailors were completely asymptomatic they were actually picked up by by massive testing that was was done in their in their vessel but but not actually many many of them have no symptoms so it's interesting to see that they are either being reinfected uh or or simply intermittently excreting the virus in their in their nasopharyngeal secretions and i think we're going to know the answer because they can do comparisons between the first viruses and the second and see if there's a big difference in them something that cannot evolve within the same person thank you nestor so heather brisland and put a chat in about a patient that she needed help with it was a very similar situation where the patient continues to test positive um greater than two weeks since his last symptoms but is still testing persistently positive and she's just asking if there's any guidance um in terms of whether to continue to quarantine these people and i know that that um can't put the guidance from the cdc for non-healthcare settings but i honestly don't know and i'm not sure nestor if you do uh if if they actually address this specific situation heather do you did you have any other well yeah it's just a um you know i think this is one of those broad public health versus individual patient trade-off questions this guy is a elderly gentleman from gallup he's native he's really eager to get home to his family he's isolated at the alternate care site that we have here and they're trying to persuade him on a day-to-day basis not to leave because he keeps testing positive but now he's been there for a month and how do we make a decision about whether or not to let him go home you know if we were using a symptom-based strategy he would have left a long time ago but we opted into the test-based strategy and can't say for sure that he's not contagious which is a dilemma so i guess i'm just looking for like a straw poll of colleagues would you keep him or would you let him go home exactly that that's a that's a great question and and we get these questions answered i'm uh asked all the time uh with with patients that have been uh in quarantine and they they they go the the way of the testing algorithm as opposed to the symptom algorithm if you go through the testing algorithm obviously and you have a positive test it's very hard for you to tell the family or the person or the worker go back to your work or go back to your family it's really hard uh on the other hand if they have you know and cdc actually does not prioritize either algorithm so if you go with the clinical algorithm they can go back as soon as they have you know several days of being asymptomatic and and and 10 days of you know of the deceased initiation so what we need is a good epidemiological study that that actually shows that these people who are late shedders let's let's call them uh you know late setters are not infectious as soon as we know that they do not produce secondary cases at home or at work we'll probably be more more sure that that this is just rna of the virus shedding with the probably with the deaths of the cells in the respiratory tract and not really infectious virus but we don't know that for for a fat it could be the other way around they could still be infectious and we don't know and the issue is that that the other tests that we have besides the pcr is the culture and now more recently the antigen test and they really do not tell you um i mean the culture is very insensitive it's really really i mean you need according to a german study that we have commented in in these echo sessions you need 10 to the six like almost a million copies of the viral rna to to have a positive culture so if you have less than that you and you try you attempt a viral culture using human cells or some other laboratory cells you're not going to have a positive result um so so you are not sure really there there is or or there is not um you know active virus that can produce infection and that's that's really the question and it's a difficult difficult uh question to answer at this point thank you nestor heather i i think also you know we have this might be a good question for the cdc hotline actually because i don't know that they're going to have the answer but i would definitely call them because what we need is some sort of that whatever best the best science is to have a national guideline about it so that we can all follow the same the same guidelines in my opinion so maybe you can you can bring that back to us after you talk to them okay um nestor there's a question a really good question it says are there any alternatives for testing and long-term care with residents with dementia and aggression the nasal swab is traumatic and difficult in these cases yeah there's there's actually two alternatives and and one is a nasal swabbing which is less uh deep into the nose you just need to go to the turbinates um so using nasal swabs um it's it's probably less uncomfortable for the patients and i know tri-core is working on on uh on saliva in you know being able to make the diagnosis by just taking saliva uh from from patients which is obviously less invasive even than than a nasal nasal swab so those are two modalities that they are trying to validate uh to have alternatives uh to the to the you know relatively uncomfortable not so far in yield uh struggling which is pretty deep and and you have to be you know a few seconds with a swap inside to be able to get a good sample thank you nestor and i'm going to turn it over to matt but i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme for this session just got put into the chat so if you want to um get see me for this session please go ahead and fill out that evaluation and i'll turn it back over to matt all right thanks carla so another testing question so this is from dan saltman so with the current technologies and knowledge base what would you recommend as the optimal return to work testing strategy see that's a really difficult question so i mean how an infectious disease i'm not an epidemiologist or an economist and i think you need to be all of the above to be able to answer that um and actually i have heard that there's uh in our state there's uh a shortage of the of the swaps or or or viral transfer medium so i mean it's really i mean the the easy answer would be test everybody before they go to work test them several times a week but that's not a realistic recommendation it's very very hard to implement a test all test frequently strategies so i think we're going to end up doing a combination of prioritizing who's truly at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting the disease um on one hand and uh number two how severe the disease it is if you acquire so you can you can um start to think like you know nursing homes and people with high risk needs to be tested frequently and people around those person need to be tested more frequently than than in other settings with everybody it's mostly young healthy um and also you know the the many factors that that guide this decision is really really a very difficult um answer to give there's some guidance actually the the john hopkins university actually published um some recommendation or a framework how to evaluate every work uh worker situation and it has to do with the with the number of contacts that person have the intensity of the contact is it's different a person who works you know in front of a computer and doesn't see anybody as opposed to a starbucks uh coffee person that that will talk to you know 200 people every day and and be very close to them so so you have to individualize the risk of transmission and also the risk of severe disease in the person that in the in the in the in the context but it's very difficult i don't think i'm i'm able to answer easily that that question all right thank you and thanks for the question dan so here's a question from jeffrey miller is there any evidence that you're aware of positive or negative regarding copin 19 for the use of nasal treatments that many patients are now using for allergies such as steroid sprays neti pot with nasal saline nasal antihistamine use no i haven't seen any any publications to that regard the only thing the closest thing that i just saw was an editorial um i think an investigator suggesting using inhale hydroxychloroquine because they can achieve higher levels in the alveoli and and theoretically higher levels in the pneumocytes deep type 2 so so in the lung tissue with nebulizing hydroxychloroquine and actually in in that uh common um the the and it struck me because of the what they did two of the authors of that comment actually nebulize hydroxychloroquine and obtain levels on their own so it was interesting um but i mean this is just a preliminary comment uh but i haven't seen anything regarding any any nasal treatment or or inhale treatment for for specifically for kobe 19. all right thank you and uh here's a question that was sent in with registration from luz rodriguez in montana so uh any updates with respect to the use of famotidine or um montillo cast for treatment of cova-19 i haven't heard anything on monte lucas i know there are um last time i counted like 1400 trials registered in clinicaltrial.gov regarding coffee so there are many many things that are that have been studied uh i know a little bit more on the story on famotidine infamous actually a u.s physician actually visited china and singapore at the beginning of the epidemic and he noticed that some of the doctors there were using high dose from autism to treat some of the patients so there's a study i think in one of the hospitals out of northeast i think is in new york that is actually testing doing a clinical trial with high dose promoting to see if it has any effect on on copy 19 i don't i don't even know the mechanism behind it um how would with an antihistamine or an acid suppressant will work with these viruses i haven't seen it in some of the reviews that i looked at but there is at least one clinical trial that i know of that they are actually testing families in but not only because i haven't really looked specifically i can i mean i can go to cleancontrol.gov and see if they're using it um for this it's another new modulator so i wouldn't be surprised if there is uh if there is some evidence or or or some preclinical data on it but i i haven't really seen anything specifically thank you and back to you carla thank you matt um a couple of more questions we have time for a couple more um let's see nestor there's a question about the amount of time that a either a nasal swab or an esophageal swab needs to be how long it needs to be in there basically before so so you can get the optimal um result from your testing can you do you know about that can you talk about that no i i don't know a specific time i haven't really read the details of the small print of the testing i just know that that because this is a virus and in general respiratory viruses are within cells so you actually have to to try to dislodge some cells to get the cells into the into the swab um i have heard but this this is just her that that at least a few seconds you have to do um the the the swabbing in order to do that too it's not just in and out but you actually have to work on it to to get some of the cells but i haven't really uh read the the specific time that you need to to do the nasal or nasopharyngeal swab i don't know if anybody in the show will know that in the in the group well veronica had said in the question veronica salazar that she had heard or not sorry it wasn't it was uh monica brown martinez has said that she had heard it should be for 10 seconds but that that that people were doing it for a lot less than that so just wanted to know if you knew for sure and the other thing that i heard and i actually heard in an earlier conference that i have today is that that you need to use the right swap for the right anatomical side there was another and ago one of the persons in the meeting said that he went to be tested and they used a nasal swab which is i think thicker and bigger and they tried to get a nasopharyngeal sample from him and it was very very uncomfortable really very uncomfortable and you know and he had been tested before with it with the nasopharyngeal and said this was much more uncomfortable so i think it's important for the for the workers that are doing the testing to check that they're using the right um the right swap for the right test thank you nestor and can you i know you may know a little bit about this but can you talk about if there's any testing for an infectious virus or how that could be done no i think one way is to do a viral culture because if you can if the secretion from a person can actually infest infect cells in the laboratory that's that's like a a way to to to to prove that you have infectious virus the other thing if we have a model an animal model you can actually take a sample from a person and inoculate it into an animal obviously those two things are really impractical in clinical day-to-day practice because viral cultures um you know are difficult are expensive they take time uh so it's not something you can do and get an answer in a couple of days and the same with animal with with center diagnostics or animal diagnosis it's very costly you need to have a good model either macaques or or one of the mouse models that can be infected with coronaviruses and and obviously it's completely impractical the other thing which i think is doable is actually looking at the epidemiology if you have a lot of people who are discharged from home and they go back to their family um and and they're sick and they're and you detect secondary cases uh as a consequence of that discharge or that sent home or a person who returns to work and and is associated with an outbreak once they have you know presumably recover um that would demonstrate at least indirectly that that person is setting infectious virus and that can be done with epidemiologic studies but but aside from that i mean it's really hard to prove the infectiousness because you need a lab you need a research lab to do the animal and the and the sales um infectivity stories thank you um last question uh is there a recommendation that you know for how often frontline healthcare personnel should be getting tested no and and we have been discussing this in unm i i don't think we have uh an answer and again i i refer back to the to this john hopkins framework it depends on on the exposure the severity uh the intensity of the of the exposure um but it's very hard i mean this this disease has a relatively short incubation period so so if you're tested today and you're negative you can you know you can acquire the disease and start transmitting five or six days later so so as short as you know almost a week uh you can you can be infectious even if you were tested if you're tested on monday or negative you can be you know if you got infected on tuesday you can be disseminating the seas on sunday so in if you look at just the incubation period i would say if you want to be a hundred percent you have to test you know workers every week but i don't know if that is a realistic thing something that you can sustain for all the workers all the healthcare workers in all of the hospitals clinics and and dental clinics and other facilities that provide healthcare it's really really very difficult in our current um environment we have limited testing uh and unlimited swaps limited viral transform media et cetera but that would that would be my my recommendation to do it you know at least uh every week if you want to be 100 sure but it depends also on the trans you know how many people you have in the community what type of of uh community transmission you have so it's it's it's a difficult question to answer too thank you nestor we're giving you a possible question so i think we just have a couple more minutes left i want to make a couple of announcements um we uh i want to thank everyone thank you nestor so much for all of your um your input and everyone for joining this session we have a couple of other um echoes coming up this week that i wanted to tell people about because they might be interested there's a critical care echo um on thursday from eight eight to nine that michelle harkins runs and she has a guest coming he's actually a friend of ours who we went to medical school with but he he lives in new york city he was a primary care provider then became a hospitalist and really has been having to be work on the front lines sort of as a critical um like learning critical care on the fly and it should be an interesting discussion so if you're interested please uh please sign up for that echo on thursday um we also have our our regular friday tele echo echo sessions and this friday we have a a discussion and talk by jenny way who's an inter or to gallup indiana medical center she's going to talk about uh covenanting in the homeless population and there and also in general and what some recommendations are should be really interesting as well and then lastly we actually have a new echo that's starting this week on wednesdays it's gonna it's it's going to be infection control and resiliency for nursing facilities and it's going to be twice a month um and that will be from two to three so that is this wednesday if you're interested please go to the website to find out about any of those echo sessions we would love to have you have you there uh lastly i want to just to remind everyone or not remind you to tell you that we're not going to have an office hours on next monday because of memorial day so we will not have echo will be closed on that day we won't have any office hours that day and um other than that please see the cme link in the chat and we look forward to seeing you either a week from monday or at some of our other tele echo sessions thanks everyone,,5/18/2020
7,afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious diseases office hours we're really happy to see everybody today um i just want to have a couple of announcements before i do some brief introductions and we'll get started uh with with um dr sosa's questions um here at project echo as you all have heard us say now many times we love to see your faces we like we like to we want to build community so we would love for people to see each other so if you have a camera and can use it please turn it on um we we have a lot of quite a few questions that were submitted beforehand but if you have questions during the session please put them in the chat box we would ask that you not answer those if people not answer those questions in the chat box if they're directed toward the hub um and we the only uh yeah if you want to make a comment or something that's fine but please try not to answer those questions and uh that are directed toward the hub and also just we ask that you keep your microphone muted unless we call on you for a specific um to ask your question out loud a couple of other things our digital librarian kent northwest nordsworthy is puts things into the chat during the entire presentation um so we would we would uh love for you to take advantage of those and also you can take advantage of those resources on our website as well so we'll go ahead and get started i'm just going to do some brief introductions and then go to dr sosa i also i want to introduce myself i'm carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm um and one of the associate directors of project echo and um joanna can you go ahead and introduce yourself hi there everybody joanna katzman i took a little breather for the last two weeks but i'm back and uh so good to see everybody thank you joanna and we'll be co-facilitating this session together um also i know carissa colbreath is on although i don't see her in my screen right now and chris we call on you all the time as an expert so can you please just introduce yourself hi everyone i'm carista colbreath i'm the director for infectious disease diagnostics here at tricore happy to help uh answer any of the diagnostic test questions and have with me today one of our molecular genetics fellows in the department of pathology great thank you chrissa and um last dr sosa please introduce yourself and i think you have some shy slides to share with us today yes uh hi every everybody i'm glad to be here be back with the kobe after the memorial uh break memorial weekend break um yes i actually have if you can if i can be allowed to share the the the slides let me see if i can yeah let me where is the message just one second i don't see the i haven't eaten this finally as well marla can you introduce yourself sure hi everybody marla sievers i'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the new mexico department of health thank you carl i'm having trouble finding the the slide let me see if i have it can you can you see it now um uh we just see your inbox how about now no not yet i have it in my big screen so i just uh when you push your screen it should show you both your screen semester and you should be able to see the slideshow and just click directly on that so i i hit yeah go ahead and hit share screen and then you can either pick from um an option that has just the slides itself or you can pick the screen that the slideshow is on right the problem is that when i hit the shares screen i don't see the slide deck i don't see the i have it in my desktop but i don't see it listed here so nestor can you open it on your desktop yeah it's open oh i mean it's open i can see it behind the um try sharing just the screen then perfect there it is okay okay great i'm sorry for that technical glitch i'm really sorry okay so yeah today i decided it's been so such a long time since we we met just a couple of weeks for koby this is a long time i just wanted to go over some some of the headlines uh research headlines that that we have heard uh in the scientific community and also a few of the papers really quickly so i think i'm just going to take you know five or ten minutes um maybe slightly more to share this so so one of the one of the most interesting stories that i that i saw and this is something that i've seen in some editorial comments it's that you know we have probably underestimated the importance of the super spreading events um i remember when the sars won the original sars 20 years ago came around there was this issue of the super spreaders and there was this outbreak in hong kong you know in an apartment complex but we really didn't appreciate that until recently um but there's it's there's clear evidence now with all the outbreaks in churches um in in nursing homes and other places that there's obviously a phenomenon of this super spreader people who actually apparently have a very high viral load and they they can infect many people's um many people are the same in the same event uh and in fact there was there was a paper uh just a review paper commenting that maybe up to 80 of the cases that we are seeing are actually related to these these uh pockets or outbreaks in different locations so that was an interesting uh finding from the epidemiological point of view the second news and then you probably heard in the news in the general media is that at least one of the candidate vaccines was shown to be effective in macaques macaques they they don't have a severe disease as we do as human do with with sarcoby too but they were protected from from especially from lung disease by this dna dna vaccine so they're there that is encouraging um encouraging information and the the other finding also uh we have been always asked arguing if if if sars kobe 2 or kobe infection provides immunity at least there's a good experiment on on also animal experiment in which they were infected with sarcoby ii and then were re-challenged several weeks later and they were actually protected from the second infection so at least a non-human primate we can induce protective immunities so our hope is that the humans will also develop uh protective immunity and in fact related to this topic the korean cdc uh actually published it's not a scientific article but published like a white paper uh explaining um or describing what they what they think it's happening with these re-positive subjects meaning the persons who have already recovered from kobe and they are test negative by pcr and then all of a sudden several weeks down the road they test positive again and there was you know a lot of questions are are those people infective or are they infectious to other uh is this really a relapse or a reinfection and in their opinion it's just uh intermittent uh excretion of non-viable virus like they were not able to culture the virus nor they did they identify any secondary cases associated with these three positive uh subjects and i think also the lab is it's looking so probably clarissa can comment they're trying to to find correlation between the the cycling time of the pcr reaction and this type of late positive patients will so we can we can talk about it but it's good news the bottom line is the good news probably these people are not infectious they just have like remnants of viruses in their respiratory secretions and they test positive even weeks or or days after they have completely recovered from from the kobe 19. um an interesting story out of spain that i thought it was it was interesting because this is a european country first wall uh country and and they found uh correlation between poverty level or or or financial status of people and and call it mortality so it's something that is not just affecting the united states but it's also affecting uh other places in the world so so poverty and and you can imagine what the third world is experiencing now with kobe 19 especially brazil india iran is having another outbreak so so it's something to to you know to think about children uh the there's def they are definitely not apparently the drivers of the epidemic they have been only rarely associated with like the index case of an outbreak and the viral loss seems to be lower obviously we have the concern of this multisystem inflammatory syndrome with them but at least uh it's encouraging to know that that so far what we know so far uh of children is that they are uh affected in a less or a proportion of less proportion of kids are affected by this disease and at the same time they don't seem to be the amplifier or the drivers of the epidemic because of issues with the viral load and the the way they respond to this infection another piece of good news we already have a publication on a on a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that hopefully will go or move forward to to be therapeutics in this disease so not just convalescent plasma which is just getting plasma from from a person they have recovered this is actually an antibody have they have been uh produced and can be uh producing large quantities to be administered as a selective antibody uh for the for the spike protein so that's also um you know some hopeful news in the in the research uh finally there was a large uh retrospective study you know almost a hundred thousand um patients included in this story looking at hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine either alone or combined with with a microlight most of the time with acetomycin and um and again the the results were negative or or no benefit from hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and in fact they found that those who were treated with either of these drugs alone or combined with with a macrolides who had an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia so that was a large landsat publication um although and there have been some critiques about this publication in the in the lay press at least but it seems to be a pretty i don't think it's going to change the result of the of the of the trial the the fact that we are seeing no uh effectiveness at least as a therapeutic agent for the hydroxychloroquine and coral queen and this we have been talking for some time a bit of sad news for if you remember earlier in the epidemic the swedish government decided not to impose like severe um stay-at-home orders and social distancing and actually they were very liberal in their restrictions uh with the hope that the population was going to develop um her immunity that we they were going to have like a high level of protection and not too much uh death and and and actually it didn't work out that well uh they're actually one of the the european countries with the highest incidents especially if you compare with the other scandinavian countries that have more restrictive social distancing and unfortunately when they did uh cerro prevalent study in in stockholm in their capital only 7.2 percent of the of the population was sort of positive so they didn't they they were not able to achieve that you know 50 60 80 percent sort of prevalence to to claim like her immunity so so it was very low and and they they are paying a relatively high price for that so that's sort of the headlines that i wanted to share i'm just going to share a couple of more slides really quickly um let me see if i can advance this thing um just this is a publication in nature they um i'm not going to go into details but they they have already um studied to us you know to us in in depth the structures of the virus and and it's very interesting that the way they they i remember the first few diagrams that that we use for for the virus were really very simple now they're we're getting a lot of details on the ultra-structural um and and you know different characteristics of the viruses really i thought it was an interesting um illustration the other big study that was published and you probably heard from dr faushi um communication several weeks ago now it's been published by the dr it says they're in the severe treatment and they actually had over a thousand patients and they were treated with either and said desi beer or placebo this is this was really a double blind placebo control trial and the message is that it it's uh help decreasing the length of stay of the patient from 15 to 11 days or four day and there was also some impact on immortality but that was not statistically significant and what this graph is actually showing is the different group the overall group on the left which is the panel a a patient not receiving oxygen those receiving oxygen and those on high flow nasal cannula and the benefit the the patient that benefit the most were patients who were receiving oxygen um and actually the question that we have are the mechanically ventilated patients benefit apparently not in this study there was really no difference and you can see how the true the blue and the red curve of placebo and rendezvous intertwined in the in the graph so so there was no significant benefit in that subgroup of patients in the patient that are more advanced or or that are already in mechanical ventilation so the take-home point for me of this study is that if you're going to use rendessive use it uh earlier before the patient is actually needing ecmo or mechanical ventilation if you can because it seems to be more effective earlier than than late there was another rendezvous study also published in the new england journal uh in which they compared five to ten days and and i thought this this graph was kind of nice um and and again the main message of this study was that there was no difference between five and ten days even for uh mechanical ventilation or patient with high flow oxygen so um as you know rendezvous is recommended for 10 days for those who who are in a mechanical ventilation of five days who are outside the icu but apparently there's no difference so that that may in the future change the length of therapy for rendezvous based on these um and this study another story for those who like pathology i think we have also uh speculated on what type of changes are seen in the in the lungs and and they did a very um very nice publication they compare actually the lungs of patients who die of cobalt with patients who die of influenza and looking for differences in the pneumonia caused by kobe and by influenza and also they have controlled non non-disease lungs to compare and the the main difference where in the the the finding of of uh thrombosis in the in the in the alveoli this is this is the photo of an alveoli and you know the arrow heads are showing actually occlusion of the blood vessels in the alveoli and that explains in part the hypoxia and and all the physiologic arrangements that you see in patients with kobe and they went ahead and did also um electro microscopy and and you can see panel a is a normal lone pair panel b it's a it's an alveoli with with kobe then you can see how uh you know damage and destroy the vasculature of the lung is uh and panel d on the right lower corner it's uh endothelial cell which is also infected and you can see the variance uh in the in the white arrow heads the small bearings inside the endothelial cell demonstrating and uh you know some of the characteristics of the disease there was also a publication in nature but i'm not going to go into this i'm just going to mention and i recommend this it's a very nice review of the different vaccines that people are investigating there's more than 90 candidates of copy vaccines some are virus other use the viral vector or there are nucleic acid or protein based um and and they're different in different countries in north america china europe they're different groups of of researchers both public non-profit academic and private looking for for a vaccine solution so i strongly recommend this uh reading in nature.com they they go ahead and explain all the different um type of vaccine how virus vaccines work how are protein-based vaccine work and what the idea behind it uh the vector vaccines which are basically uh two types one it's replicating vector virus which is a different virus with dna of kobit inside um and a non-replicating virus and and finally the rna and dna vaccines which are which are some of the most innovative ideas it's just injecting directly the dna or the rna of the virus without a viral particle associated with it and and also they they have something called virus-like particle which is another model of vaccine so really interesting publication worth uh reading and they have very nice graphics as you can see if you if you teach or or or need this for for um for learners it's really good okay so that that's all i'm going to say i'm not going to take more time i have some other slides but really in the headlines i mentioned most of what i already described so thank you and and we can go ahead and go to the questions thank you very much thank you very much nestor for that excellent presentation overview lots of ex lots of things happening in the literature it's really really hard to keep up so i appreciate that there were a couple of questions just that i'll ask that didn't come in through the um earlier but came in through the chat about your about what you talked about right now so i'm going to go ahead and ask those first um leslie hayes wanted to know do the super spreaders usually become quite ill from the high viral load or can they remain asymptomatic yeah it varies i think in different outbreaks that have been different i mean some of the super spreaders have been ill and they they go ahead and develop severe disease but other have not i mean it's not a it's not uh constant in some of the the cases in the cruise ships and and and other settings the super spread have not been that ill but they they do have a high bar a lot in other cases they have you know developed more severe disease and has been hospitalized so there's not a clear correlation between being a super spreader and having a very severe disease at least from the papers that i read you thank you and then for the patients who continue to be positive um bianco ortega wanted to know when they were retested to confirm were they re-tested to confirm negativity and or were they symptomatic again or why were they and why were they tested was it just in the study setting or yeah both i think in some cases they had symptoms so they decided to test them again in some of the cases from korea and in other cases it's uh basically because of of concern or or some type of infection prevention control disposition in which they are tested again and and they have been found to be positive um but but you know so far it looks like it's not related to reactivation or actual reinfection but it's actually sort of a of a remnant activity and i think maybe maybe uh karisa can can comment on this on this subject as i mentioned before yeah so in that korean cdc study um about half of the patients that were retested as positive um were symptomatic and the other half were asymptomatic so it was a good combination um of that um and there when they looked back at the viral the ability for the viruses to grow from the np swabs and that's how they were able to determine that in most cases it was non-viable organism that was present certainly one limitation of the study overall and anything that compares pcr to viral culture is that culture isn't as sensitive as pcr but i think the data are really starting to emerge in multiple studies uh that the virus is no longer able to be cultured from specimens after those initial tests are positives um and it's also quite independent um at least in the korean study it's independent of the ct value so even um heavier um loads in the viral pcr we're still not able to be cultured uh 14 days after uh the initial positive um and so it may still be independent of the ct value and it's really um about the time from the positive rather than the positive culture thank you very thank you carissa um nestor how does the swedish experiment which is like you said is unfortunate relate to the the hopes of the macaque studies well i think um i mean if you remember this chief epidemiology in sweden actually uh speculated that people were going to be infected and that a lot of young people were going to have mild disease and they were going to get hurt immunity so after they have endured this epidemic to a higher degree if you compare it with other european countries the disappointing point aspect is that they actually got only seven percent of the population uh they may be immune we don't we still i'm not sure how how strong the immunity is to the disease to the kobe 1i team but the the fact that it's such a low percentage it's it's really uh it's really you know disappointing the experiment with them with the macaques the macaques after they were infected i think it was a small number seven nine i don't remember the exact number but they developed antibodies and they were able to resist the challenge they did not develop uh as much viral replication and symptoms as they did the first time around so uh there was protection on the in these few experimental animals um in in in sweden what happened is that despite the the sort of large epidemic that they had uh as a whole the population was not was not affected or at least the sample that they did of the population had only that seven percent um and they were expecting much more and i've seen several numbers from spain and other places and it goes from you know as low as two or three percent to fourteen percent but we i don't think um outside like an outbreak uh the the general population sort of prevalence uh i haven't seen very high numbers which is what what you know the ideal situation for to have her immunity uh so so in that way it's it's somewhat disappointing that that they they had a hard you know epidemic and not nothing to to to to to gain from it thank you mr um one last question then we'll go to um i'll go to joanna um some patients the question is some patients recovered from the code but continue to have shortness of breath for weeks after is there a role for pulmonary angiography to look for residual alveolar infarcts or emboli that i don't know i would have to ask michelle harkins or some of the other pulmonologists if that is it have been looked into i haven't i haven't really looked into into that and actually i haven't heard or read much about recovery and the post copy you know what you do post copied and what type of of lung disability these patients have i haven't really seen that much literally they may be maybe around i haven't really looked into that aspect i think it's important to know if they recover completely or they have some degree of of disability or or chronic lung disease after coping i do not know honestly great thank you thank you nestor over to you joanna great thanks carla thanks nestor i'm going to move on to some of the kind of questions that people put in at pre-registration and they're related to um a kind of uh pharmaceutical studies trials treatment so they're kind of a whole host of questions um uh the first question is from jackie good here in albuquerque are there any studies currently in process regarding looking at a person's antibody titers over time and if so are they seeing these numbers decreased i wonder if that might be for you nestor or perhaps for carissa um or just what your thoughts are on that right i can i can say a few things i mean i've seen several papers on immune reaction to the virus i mean they're people who are actually studying the production antibody earlier on in the epidemic the chinese researchers actually published their experience and then yeah there is there is production of antibodies iga igg and igm uh relatively early in the disease i have seen publications also from new york and and how people are mounting at least an and immunoglobulin production uh if we we don't we cannot talk about like absolute immunity or absolute protection but they do have a production and some of those antibodies in the lab they seem to be neutralizing antibodies so they prevent cells from being infected when you challenge cells um that are normally infected by coping in the lab and you you pre-treat them with these antibodies with this you know a device produced by these patients they seem to be protected um and that's that's the hope that we have for the use of convalescent plasma and the hope that we use for monoclonal antibodies that they will prevent infection uh because they don't allow the virus to attach to the to the cells so we we are seeing that that's as much as i can as i can say regarding antibody production um and the story that i have with you thank you nestor um just wanted to ask about um just some kind of general uh if there's been any kind of changes in general percentages of patients who have mild moderated uh severe symptoms or if it still seems to be mainly people with either asymptomatic might have coveted asymptomatically uh the majority of patients with mild symptoms some moderate and then uh less frequently severe if there's been any kind of epidemiological studies looking at that yeah not that i know of i think that's one of the things one of the few things that have remained relatively constant with the only caveat that those numbers that were published by china uh the first 70 000 patients it's heavily influenced by the age of the population if if you if you look at the disease distribution among young people you know a city let's say in africa where most of the people are young it's completely different that if you see like what happened in milano or in some of the cities in northern italy where the the high percentage of the population were elderly so they had a high percentage of you know hospitalizations uh micu admissions death so so i think it's it's that and also the the comorbidities as it's happening with some of our our own native american that they have diabetes obesity and other social determinants of health and they are more severely affected but i think in general that proportion uh it's it's um sustaining um in one of the cruise ship outbreaks i i read a number that i had never seen like 80 were asymptomatic so we are seeing i mean the deeper you get into the the the study of the outbreak you find more and more asymptomatic i remember the first publication was like 10 then it went up to 30 then 40 the italians said 43 and now i've seen this publication that up to 80 if you look you know deep enough into an outbreak or a population you may find a lot of asymptomatic infections uh so if it goes from 30 to you know more than 50 percent of the patients are asymptomatic that that's what have really changed but the disease severity seems to be relatively constant constant but influenced by the by the you know the age and comorbidities uh in in the population affected very good thanks mister and i also think that they um i also think that the navy ship that was uh that stopped um somewhere uh near guam i think where where it was they also i think tested all of those and i think there was thousands of of asymptomatic uh covet positive sailors um something similar to that to the cruise ship i think a nest i believe that was also the case um i wanted to ask um if there's been a couple two questions similar if there's been any changes to um kind of uh guidelines regarding care of ambulatory cova positive patients and then if there's been any status of new treatments for uh covet positive patients in general but perhaps not right not not significantly the only thing that i have seen both here in the united states and abroad is the the deletion of the hydroxychloroquine from the protocols there were a lot of hospital centers that they they had hydrochlorokine in some form included in the routine treatment protocols but uh i think probably over the last three or four weeks when all these studies uh came out of the toxicity and lack of efficacy uh i would say the majority of the protocols have dropped the hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or coral queen with with acetomycin that's probably the most significant and and also the fact that we are considering rendezvous almost the standard of care despite the relatively modest results because i mean from 15 to 11 days and no significant uh mortality there was some decrease in mortality but it was not statistically significant in the new england journal article that i showed despite that a lot of the the protocols are now including rendezvous at least considering rendezvous uh only limited by the amount of of the drug available really and and and in fact most of the the trial designs that are being um uh performed now the people who are thinking new studies they are considering using rendezvous with other drugs or you know put the rendezvous in the in the treatment arm because it seems to be the best we have so far thank you nestor um i'm gonna ask you one more and then turn it back over to carla um i one of the track questions from yehuda pat says um should every infected symptomatic and i might say yeah symptomatic patient be started on full um anticoagulation um or i guess i might even add nester full anticoagulation or even um you know some or an anti-platelet agent aspirin even um so what what are your thoughts on that right i can say what what i have seen in the protocols in the hospital brokers including the one that we use in unm we are only using prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation in patients who are admitted we're not routinely using it for outpatient i have not seen and they're probably working on a like an aspirin or an easy to take anticoagulant for ambulatory patients but remember these thrombotic events occur uh you know they're not that frequent i mean they have been strokes and reports in literature but it's not like 20 or 30 they're actually less than one percent of these thrombotic events unless you have a severe disease and you're a media in which you have like this hypercoagulable state as part of your cytokine storm and as part of your multi-organ diff dysfunction so so you know you need to this to do a study actually to see if there's any benefit of adding something you know as relatively uh benign as a baby aspirin to prevent clotting but i haven't seen a publication to that regard there's probably a retrospective because there's people taking aspirin prophylactically from anything so maybe we can look back and and see but i haven't seen i've seen with ac inhibitor with our uh inhibitors but i haven't seen with aspirin showing benefit it may be there but i haven't seen that article in which to see there's any protection to or severe disease or thrombosis with aspirin thanks nestor back to you carla thank you joanna um there's a question and marvel this may be best for you just about how um people who how we count people who are recovered can you talk a little bit about why there's such a discrepancy between the number of people that are positive and the number that have died and the number that have recovered um just how that's counted sure so the way we are counting people as recovered right now is pretty straightforward using the cdc criteria to discontinue isolation so if someone has clinically improved they've been a-febrile for at least three days and it's been at least 10 days since their symptom onset um or their test they can be can you know marked as recovered um and then able to stop their self-isolation that certainly doesn't address kind of the ongoing effects that people may have from their illness or people who are recovered who then go on to test positive again so if a person has previously been marked as recovered and for some reason gets retested later and has a positive test they come out of that recovered bucket and go back into the case bucket currently so there's a lot of work being done at the department of health to follow up with cases to try to mark people as recovered everyone who's a case gets followed by a case monitoring team and people are you know marked as recovered based upon that criteria so for people who are asymptomatic it's a simple 10 days and for people who have symptoms it really depends on their clinical course how long it takes them to reach that recovered mark in terms of the data that the state is reporting on the website i would say that we have a gap in the native american population being marked as recovered and part of that has to do with working with tribal entities to do that case monitoring and those case investigations and just coordinating that data among many different you know groups that are monitoring cases and compiling those reports great thank you very much um and i think this one was probably good uh let's go to carissa there have been reports of the abbott id now rapid test with false negative results even with patients who who are symptomatic what is the next step or approach to the patient or maybe to carissa and nestor yeah so um those reports um have definitely been in the literature um and so for right now the fda is recommending that if the patient is symptomatic particularly if they're going to be hospitalized that that should be followed up with a different method um and and sent to more of a laboratory setting for a test rather than another rapid diagnostic i will point out that the cepheid um assay has not seen that type of um sensitivity issue so if this test does need to be repeated it could be repeated on a cepheid if that was available um but otherwise it should be sent to a laboratory for um a more laboratory-based test thank you nestor did you have anything else to add no i i was actually going to ask karissa if she has an update on on saliva or any other and less invasive method of collecting the pcr test i think it's it's yes so we are working very hard on saliva laura has been participating with those studies right now i go from i think last time i said i wouldn't make any promises today i can say i'm cautiously optimistic but we still we have to submit the data to the fda in order to add in saliva as an additional specimen type and so we remain very um optimistic but with uh caution and we'll keep you posted in the next couple of weeks to try to get a less invasive specimen but for now self-collected um provider observed self-collected nasal swabs are acceptable um and so that that's a nice option where a patient can be handed a nasal swab say in their vehicle and as long as the provider is watching them that specimen is currently acceptable great thank you mister can you talk a little bit about what you know what's being called covered fingers and toes and what the the pathology is behind that right yeah i've seen very few publications but i have seen uh it's mostly like uh either an embolic or traumatic event of the capillaries of the toes and fingers it almost looks like a frostbite i mean you see a discoloration bluish discoloration on mostly on the on the on the tip of the toes and it seems to be related to the to the hyper quavo level state that this patient have and now with the last publication that i mentioned there's evidence endothelias or inflammation of the endothelial um lining or lining of the the blood vessels so so it's it's you know it's something that we are seeing and there are other uh cutaneous manifestation that that we are learning more but it seems to be a manifestation of an embolic or thrombotic event uh local thrombosis of the small vessels uh in the toes or fingers thank you and um before i go back to joanna nestor do you is there any um data on the results of the use of convalescent plasma in new mexico and patients in new mexico do you know of anything no no jed i know they're using it as an open label uh uh compassionate uh type of treatment we're using it we have a protocol in university of mexico and and i can actually i mean our protocol is actually to measure levels of antibody we're studying really like the so-called pharmacokinetic it's not a pharmacological product it's actually uh convalescent plasma we're trying to to find levels of neutralizing antibodies both in the transfused plasma and in the patient in you know before and immediately after the transfusion to see if their levels changes so we're doing that it's not really an efficacy trial because it's an open label we're giving it to to the patient that qualifies but we don't have a control group to compare with um so i cannot really uh say anything about it i mean we have we have used it in i think less than two dozen patients and some of them have died they basically continue their disease evolution unfortunately and some other have recovered but it's it's an uncontrolled uh open label so i cannot really reach any any solid conclusion we're waiting for a double line control uh study in the literature there was an open label recently retrospective review but we're waiting for a good double line control study in which we can actually see if it's uh if it's effective or more effective than the placebo thank you nestor back to you joanna thank you um yeah nesser just to a few more um questions what about the there's a question from rick froster about asking had there been any studies looking at remdissevere earlier on in the pre-hospital setting before the patient perhaps gets to the icu um have have any studies been looking at that yeah the nia idea story that was published the one i mentioned with the graphics with the kaplan-media graphics actually included patients it was pretty liberal i mean they the criteria was less than 94 oxygen saturation in room air so they did have made patients in a very uh let's say not severely they have to be hospitalized because this is an iv medication so so they haven't really i that i know or they haven't studied like at home or something they're studying an inpatient patient that qualified for hospitalization but they they were like several levels of disease severity there were patients who were not an oxygen patient with getting oxygen patients were in high flow oxygen and mechanically ventilated and atmo patient and they actually stratified their analysis in those groups from the minimal disease to very severe disease and and as i said in my introduction it seems to be more effective in those who are hospitalized requiring oxygen but uh it's probably also affected in those not receiving oxygen but they were smaller sample and and they didn't have the power to find the difference probably because when you split a group of 500 patients you know by five then you start having 40 50 80 in each group and it's very hard to prove uh statistically significant but i think the the general comment and the discussion of the article and the accompanying editorials have commented that probably earlier is better than late uh in this situation so i wouldn't be surprised if they can it can have some utility to prevent uh becoming more ill if you use it earlier like in pre-hospital or early really early in the hospitalization thank you nestor um and i'm one wondering if robert dr gish's um is able to unmute and ask the question about the drug from russia that got released yesterday or or if not um or if uh just uh he had a commented oh dr gish sorry uh there was a drug announcement or an announcement from the russian government yesterday that they have a drug and it's they have to look up the spelling it's something like aprivier uh that they have announced that's approved and to be used to treat and has a similar effect on the rna polymerase have you all heard much about this it was just a press release no i have not i know that they have been there's this drug uh pira beer or a beefa beer has been used for influenza in japan uh and they they were they found that it has some uh inhibition of the of the river nuclear protease similar to rendezvous so it inhibits the rna sentences um but i haven't i really haven't seen any any results of of the drug aside from being one of the candidates that they are looking there's a couple of others arbital and and so there are a couple of other drugs that they are studying so i i would have to see what the russian base their decision on maybe they had some early results i i don't i don't really know but that's interesting yeah the spelling of his abigain a-v-i-g-a-n correct it's a avifa beer i think it's the scientific name of here thank you uh for for our for kent knows where they are digital librarian i'm wondering if he might be able to look that up for us and and post it thanks thanks dr gish um there there's a question interesting um from uh from margo um oh from farmington and i'm wondering if she's able to unmute um and ask the question about um west nile virus related to to covet if she's on the if she's in the house right now so to speak joanna says she doesn't have a mic in that in the chat okay i'm gonna just read her question um it's it's interesting i don't know if perhaps if uh nestor or um marla or carissa or i think eugene marciniak is on the line too it's has there been that she says there's been some speculation that people who have had had west nile virus mate be immune to coven 19 and wondering if there's been um if you might know of any data if not we can look that up no i have not i have not read anything the only the only comment that i can make and i have seen this in in the in the literature is the use of of live virus vaccine as a general like immune boosting strategy they're they're looking into mmr and and even bcg which is a bacterial vaccine as a general boosting of the of the immune system but i i i mean this these are different uh viruses uh different family of viruses um we're talking uh here so so i mean it's interesting but i i would love to see the information for that right nestor that's that relates to another question from narit pat that that says is there any interference or maybe co-benefit between coven 19 and and other viruses i think that's what you were you were getting at really is there some kind of uh immune protection for from uh related viruses is that is that really what you're suggesting something like that well exactly i mean what i have read because this is not these are mostly uh like editorial comments or opinion papers that i have seen that when once you get a viral infection there is sort of a general general um increase in the in the in in the intrinsic immunity in the immunity that we have non-specific intrinsic immunity that we all have um and that may indirectly protect you against secondary infections and that's that's the hypothesis behind they're actually testing these hypotheses by analyzing bcg vaccination and coping incidents or actually using bce as a immune stimulation uh non-specific because obviously there's no similarity no structural similarity between you know the tuberculosis black sea bacillus and and and uh and and coronavirus but actually the the the hope is that the interference and the natural killer cells and all the immune components of a of an unspecific immune reaction may protect you at least temporarily while we have a vaccine but that's that's also a hypothesis that i think has not been clearly proven thank you nestor i did i did want to remind everybody that uh kent our digital librarian um is uh did find that uh russian approved drug and he posted it and did want to remind everybody that the cme link is now on the website i did want to turn to some more kind of uh public health epidemiological kind of back-to-work back-to-school type of questions that maybe marla might have a little advance notice on or recommendations um and um some of them are do we know yet about school opening for the fall and i'm really mean and these questions came from folks in in new mexico um and also any update or guidelines and recommendations um for surveillance testing for kind of either students in in in k-12 or uh or post-secondary meaning medical clerkships things like that so maybe marla you could talk about when uh new mexico might give word on reopening school for the fall and then perhaps um is there any update for instance at unm on um medical school and other um healthcare uh pre-licensure schools thanks hey joanna this is marla um i unfortunately don't have any um insight to a school opening for k through 12. um you know i think as we get closer we'll we'll learn more about that i do know that um there is work being done by the public education department to engage superintendents um of school districts across the state um in our working group to start to talk about what the options would be for opening up in the fall um you know and much like we've done for um you know non-emergent healthcare procedures talking about what dating criteria might be appropriate um you know what sort of distancing or classroom sizes would be appropriate so there's a lot of work being done to talk about what that might look like but i haven't heard that it's a green light for opening up in the fall yet thanks so much marla and any word nestor on surveillance testing for are you involved in any work groups regarding kind of um how to bring back uh kind of pre-licensure students over right i'm just going to talk in general yes i am working on uh on one of the one of the commissions that are helping president stokes here in the university uh to prepare for a potential opening uh during the fall uh you know and there are many many people trying to analyze and as as marla was saying what measures need to be taken from all points of view i mean because we have to consider the classrooms we have to consider also the dorms uh we have to conceal the athletic uh uh you know programs so there's a lot of a lot of issues that need to be carefully considered and analyzed uh you know how we can maximize the the intervention that we know work like social distancing wearing the cloth mask they use hand hygiene practices etc plexiglas in some areas and classrooms and different engineering interventions that can be so it's a really complicated aspect and probably one of the most challenging and complicated is the testing because we we do have testing but um as you know testing is not unlimited we have you know limitations to the testing and and and you know and the tests have to be done in a very well thought manner coordinated with the department of health um if if there's a positive then that initiates a contact tracing so it's it's a whole strategy that is really they have to be thought of of a plan that it's uh combined interventions with you know contract tracing lab detection uh follow-up of whatever uh positive test and isolation of people of students staff and and faculty so it's a really complicated uh aspect of it and i i i mean i don't want to venture what i what i think about that but there's like really different points of view on how frequent the testing should be done if anything if any testing i think for me the most important thing is to have the the social i mean the social distance in hygiene and and precautions need to be in place for a safe reopening especially if they're still uh covered activity in the community so that's my comment thank you thank you nestor thank you marla back to you carla thank you um nestor or so anyone else can give an update on the um the spread of coping through through um surfaces and foam lights and things like that and the question says to to be able to reduce anxiety so i don't know if you can if you could give you could reduce people's anxiety but if you could give an update on what you know that would be great does that mean we can bring our amazon boxes in without you know without having to take you know tell me to take any medicine i i'll tell you something my wife is still cleaning them so so anything that i'm gonna say if you doubt it just ask my wife no i uh no i think uh i think it's it's important to appreciate most of the transmission has has occurred person to person i mean this is a disease that like a rainy respiratory disease that respiratory secretions from the nose from the mouth uh when you talk when you sneeze when you sing um you you you are uh expelling if you are infected either asymptomatic or symptomatic you're expelling viral particles during those early days of the of the transmission so so that's the highest um risk situation um obviously from that highest situation a close contact with a person generating aerosols or breathing in your face uh you go down to all of the other ways and obviously if you you can you can easily imagine a situation with somebody coughs or sneak it in a surface if you touch that surface shortly after that occur and the virus is still viable you know there's no ultraviolet light that have inactivated the virus uh there's no dissertation or several days of span you can touch that and then touch your eyes or your nose or your mouth and you can inoculate the viruses so it's possible but it's probably less significant um and i think this is more sort of a pragmatic approach if you can implement measures in and around yourself and in your business or your workplace to cover all those possibilities you know the the air or or person-to-person droplet transmission and also the surface remission i think it's it's okay um maybe some of the things that you do are unnecessary but it's it's a precaution if you want to decrease the risk uh you know closer to zero as possible so that that's that's the way i see this this thing i mean it's possible there's transmission but obviously it's not the main route through surfaces or amazon packages or any or or food stuff that you get in the supermarket but it's not impossible uh at least biologically feasible so you know you you have to take those percussion without going into into like an extreme of you know being in a plastic bubble and not not doing anything uh because of that fear thank you nestor marla or carissa did you have any other comments about that okay okay um and there's a question by by dr caro about uh hydro hydroxychloroquine in the use is preventative and i don't know if nestor if you can talk a little bit about that he said that the us government donated two million doses of hydroxycortex according to brazil and a promise to pursue a two-nation study for protective pre-infection infection use of hydroxychloroquine and is there is unm involved in a preventative um trial yeah there is a there is a trial i think hasn't started i talked yesterday to one of the investigators yesterday before yesterday and they are planning to do a study uh with healthcare workers and and uh and i actually i received the invitation for the study you can you can actually go into the active arm receive hydroxychloroquine if you are you know as a as been exposed to the to the virus because of your your profession or you cannot to go into the placebo arms so that and i know there are some studies looking into that obviously um because of the the toxicity that have been observed a lot of the irbs or ethics committees are you know double checking all those protocols uh because of the concern with toxicity um so so you know but there is i know there is a study that is about to start uh using hydrocephalum as a prophylactic or pre uh pre-infection either post-exposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis great thank you nestor and there was just a lot of question about um contact and the question is are you more likely to get infected or it says is it less likely to be affected if you touch your mouth versus what they're touching your eyes or your nose that i don't know i just saw a paper and i i just read the abstract uh that it says the eyes are less than the mouth and the nose but i i mean i wouldn't i don't know i honestly don't know i don't know if somebody had actually do that with macaques or some other animal modeling which they inoculate with a certain amount of viruses i don't know how you you can i mean people touch their nose their mouth and their eyes all at the same time many times a day so i don't know how you would do that scientifically to prove that one orifice is more susceptible to infection than the other except for using like an animal model and inoculating only in the eye or only in the mouth but it's an interesting question but i think we have i don't think we have an answer thank you master we always ask you really hard questions um marla i'm just going to ask you so there's a couple of questions in the chat about uh county level data for new mexico can you just talk about where the the best resource to find out and how often it's updated and just a little bit about that data before we finish today sure so there's a couple of sites that you can link to from the main nmhealth.org site one is the public dashboard and you can see uh testing data cases and deaths by county um and cases by zip code on that site recovered is not included by county yet but total recovered are and so i imagine that data will be added as we have more recovered to report at the county level and so the other place you can link to from that site is the modeling microsite and there's a weekly slide deck that is updated there with modeling data from around the state and you can look at regional and county level data for things like deaths and hospitalizations um and reproductive rate by um health regen and so that gets updated once a week and all of the historical slides are also on that modeling site so those are two good sources of statewide and county level information that the department of health puts out with their partners and the information on the public dashboard is updated every day so when it gets updated on the main dashboard every day with the new case counts that site is updated as well thank you so much marla and um yes was just we just have one minute left so i just want to um tell everybody if you didn't get your your question answered we can please re register for next week and we'll we'll try to get it answered next week our next session is next monday june 7th from 12 to 1 and you can find the registration on our website or look for the weekly email announcement also the cme link for the today is still is in the chat so please give us feedback on these sessions through the cme that would be super helpful and finally just please visit our coven 19 website for more information about this this and other cobit echoes that are available and it's nice to see everyone we will see you next week thank you,,6/1/2020
8,um can you all hear me fantastic well welcome everybody it's about uh just about a minute after 12 and i'm welcome to infectious disease office hours i i see dr sosa on the line and we might have a carissa from tricor we might have some folks from the department of health i'm going to ask our um echo uh behind the scenes phones from ecco letting me know if um uh our colleagues from the department of health or tricor are on the line um i'm joanna katzman from project echo and matt is boshonville in to facilitate for dr carla thornton matt do you want to just raise your hand wave your hand great and you'll see you'll come out in a minute but first i'd like to thank everyone for for joining us um if you are not on video and you have the opportunity if you're in a place where you can turn on your video please do so it really lets us build a community of practice uh we're so grateful to have um kent noseworthy who's our digital librarian he is going to be typing things into the chat almost as fast as nestor sosa and our colleagues uh we'll be talking if there's anything evidence-based or evidence guided uh kent will be putting things in the chat you can always just you can take information directly from the chat you no longer have to copy and paste and then at about 12 45 we'll be putting the cme the ceu link into the browser so you can get your no costs cme credits um even if you don't need the credits it's always helpful for you to fill out the cme forms so you can provide feedback for this for this session as well but without further ado i'd like to introduce nestor sosa he's our content specialist our subject matter expert who leads this uh session uh nestor would like you to start and offer any updates lately you've been giving us some kind of a more formal update and that's uh proven very helpful so thanks nestor yes thank you you wanna hello everyone for me it's a pleasure and an honor to be here uh one more time i'm going to try to share my screen uh see if i can find the presentation okay can you see my presentation excellent okay so the first comment before i go into the slides um i think one of the um issues that that actually made the news was the retraction of an article on hydroxychloroquine and a lot of people have been asking me um you know what's the meaning of that i think it was probably like six or seven days ago um it was published in in the lancet a very interesting paper it was it was a retrospective review of more than 90 000 patients all over the world who receive hydroxychloroquine and the authors concluded based on on the observation of the outcomes and toxicity that um the hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial and in fact was associated with with uh with an increased risk of of dying um and and this this story was sort of a data mining story and and as soon as it was published a lot of people from different countries started questioning the results and in fact um three of the four authors requested an independent audit of the data to the to the company that they actually actually outsource the analysis of the information and because the company did not um was not willing to conduct an uh an independent audit the the authors retired their their their authorships and and immediately landsat uh retracted the article so that that's essentially what happened but it i think it doesn't change our overall uh impression of the studies with atrocity programming there have been several studies retrospective um that have shown no benefit of hydraulic chloroquine and chloroquine and in fact in some of these stories like the va story conducted here in the united states show some increase in in cardiac arrhythmias and mortality so although this was you know the retraction of a hydroxychloroquine i don't think it changes the conclusion it's just that the data was not reliable um and it was not audible auditable so so that was the concern of the landsat there have been some other interesting publications um over the last few days and i'm gonna share with you some of these uh publications one and we have had this discussion how good the testing for kobe 19 is especially the pcr and you have heard you know from some source source sources that that some of the the you know the more traditional testing with the with in the lab very good sensitivity and specificity but there are some other rapid tests that are coming up uh are coming out in the market that they have slightly less sensitivity and i thought this article the new england journal actually compares um what's the meaning or the chance of infection when you have a negative result depending on which type of test if you use a test with a very high sensitivity and is the curve in green with a 90 sensitivity 95 specificity or you use a test like in the blue line with a sensitivity of 70 percent depending on the pre-test probability you can actually sort of um uh analyze what what's the meaning of of of a negative test if it's really a true negative or a false negative so i recommended the reading of this this article in new england to get a better understanding of this and and for instance if you have a a pre-test for probability um let's say you're 15 which is where the a uh the a in the in the graph is uh and you use a a pretty sensitive test you're okay you probably a negative result will probably mean it's really negative but as soon as you use a less sensitive test you can see how you can have 10 15 20 chance if you follow the blue curve of having a false negative so so having a negative test does not exclude the infection completely so it's a very interesting and detailed analysis and they really um make a good a good explanation on this relationship between between the prevalence of a disease and the risk that the patient actually have the disease and the and the sensitivity and specificity of the test the other the other study also related to testing um was also published in the new england journal and they actually um compare the the traditional nasopharyngeal swab done by a healthcare worker with self-obtained swabs from the tongue the knee the nasal cavity and the mid-turbinate also in the nasal cavity and and you can see from the shape of the curve that there's a pretty good correlation between both uh the nasopharyngeal test performed by a healthcare worker and the self-administered test performer on himself by the patient especially and the sensitivity especially for the nasal and and mid terminate swaps were very very high up to 94 and 96 percent when compared to the nasopharyngeal swab um and obviously the the the conclusion from this study is that at some point we're going to be able to use this other sampling method that decrease the use of ppe and decrease the risk for healthcare workers and actually patients may be able to safely collect their own specimens and send it to the lab and it's good to know that that at least these self-collected are comparable in sensitivity and performance to the to the more sophisticated um healthcare workers collection of nasopharyngeal and also more uncomfortable and more prone to gagging or or coughing or sneezing when you get the test there was also uh i i discovered this was actually published in mid-april but i have not seen this article but for for those who have asked questions about the ac inhibitors and aldosterone readiness and the attention aldosterone axis and the relationship with kobe 19 there's a really nice and well illustrated article on the relationship between patients who are taking ace inhibitors on heart and and how this may be uh either beneficial or or or deleterious or damaging to the to the patient and actually the conclusion of this review is that there's no evidence that taking ac inhibitors or or or angiotensin receptor blockers um is negative and in fact maybe maybe protective and probably in the future in the near future we're going to have uh prospective studies evaluating this question but they they explain how how um how this this drug this anti-hypertension may may help uh the inflammation in the lung by by actually decreasing the effect of angiotensin 210 um and and um you know and being a positive thing and i think there are a couple of retrospective studies actually showing some indirect evidence that hypertensive patients that were actually taking either ac inhibitors or arbs had a less severe disease and we have commented this in the past but i i really like this illustration of how the the virus that uses the ac phase 2 receptor um may be uh interacting with with actually with the ac inhibitors and another question that we have discussed um in in um in our in our echoes have been the the issue of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission and the anal just a couple of days ago published a narrative review on all the studies that have been um done in specific with outbreaks or prevalent studies that have been done in different places and what have been the percentage and you can see in the column of positive or asymptomatic the percentage of people in all those different outbreaks that that have been um tested positive but without symptoms and really the the percentage goes from as low as six percent to as high as as 87.9 or almost 90 in some of the in some of the studies um the conclusion of the study was probably the reality is around 40 to 45 percent so um the the frequency of asymptomatic infection is probably around that um you know close to 50 but no more than that and as i have said uh before it depends on the population on the age of the population the younger um young adults usually have a mild disease and more frequent asymptomatic disease than than older patients so so this is this is a nice review and they actually in this paper they actually describe each of these outbreaks which include the diamond princess cruise ship that you have you have heard in the news the uss theodore rossville um even the argentinian cruise ship that was stuck in in central america for some time and because these were sort of a close system they were able to study all the infections and and who were uh asymptomatic and who developed symptoms etc so really interesting and there are a couple of populations story here from san francisco indiana uh new jersey and other places in which they actually did population wide including iceland population-wide sero-prevalence studies and they were able to estimate more precisely the percentage of asymptomatic really an interesting story again published in the annals of internal medicine june 3rd i think the in the in the friday echo or or maybe the monday echo there was a question about a drug approved by russia russia approved the the drug fabi pierre beer for the use of in in kobe 19 um and i i looked in the literature actually did a search in the polish literature and and and see you know if we have um porridge stories and although in in the press you can you can find that both china and japan are conducting study with this drug with this this drug called favipiravir um the really there's really only one publication that actually um employed this drug against kobe 19 and it wasn't it was an open label comparative story in china um publishing actually interestingly you know it was published in an engineering magazine or general not really any any major medical journal and it was um a study of 35 patients who received favi peer review and they compared it with 45 who receive low pinabi returner which is the the protease inhibitor used for hiv but that has been also being studied for kobe 19 and the patients were also given alpha one beta interferon inhale interferon so both arm received the alpha one beta or alpha one b interferon and what they found was um a more rapid viral clear clearance with the fabira with four days uh versus eleven days with lopinavir and also x-ray improvement this patient have pneumonia or infant race uh they found that 91 of those 35 who you see five periods clear the the infiltrate as opposed to just 62 and these two findings were statistically significant so it's you know a promising result but obviously you can see the numbers are really very small this is not a double line placebo control study uh it was done very early in the epidemic and obviously the patients are treated with interference so so we don't really know what that um uh contribution of that other the other uh antiviral or immune modulator could be but it's interesting at least there's one publication and there are several others from japan and china that presumably are coming in the market but we but with this clear information actually russia and other countries have approved the use of the emergency use of of your as a potential drug against kobe 19. and this is the graph showing the the faster clearance um of the of the of the secretions or the or the pcr using fabira view compared with the lupina will return and finally uh as always i bring sort of a an interesting unexpected story this is actually a story out of harbor in which uh researchers in harbor actually look at the um at the using satellite photograph they used they looked and counted the number of cars parked around the hospitals in wuhan uh in the month of november and they actually detected that even before the official uh report of the outbreak in wuhan uh all of the all of the hospitals uh in in late fall in these places in in wuhan were having much more traffic monitored by by as i said by satellite photograph so it's interesting and they they postulate that probably this increasing movement of presumably patients or or healthcare workers in the hospital uh was due to uh to the outbreak of of kovid19 that had not been recognized or at least not accepted by the authorities uh so it's another piece of information um it's gonna be published um in the near future this was actually uh reported by abc news on the late press but they actually show the graph of the and you can see where the circle in november 2019 as the number of cars around the hospitals were much um higher than than november 2018 and there was also a peak in the in the traffic um using internet um search machines in china in in october and november so they were actually people were looking for words like cough and diarrhea uh sort of more frequently than previous years so so there's some some um interesting information of this type of mega data and satellite data on the possibility that actually the epidemic started slightly earlier in in china than that was actually reported by the authorities and this is one of those uh satellite photographs comparing the the number of cars in the same place same day of the week but two different years and that same time which is basically at noon and you can see the number of cars the red dots in the in the area in this woohan uh it's called hospital and you can see how the the number in some of these cases there was a 67 to 90 increase in the number of cars uh in october and november compared with with uh with previous years so that suggests that there was something going on uh that prompted people to visit the hospital and they obviously rule out like um you know natural disasters or other type of like scientific meetings or something else that could explain the number of cars in the hospital and they concluded that it was most likely um activity of of kobe 19 or at least the possibility of being early activity of this uh until that point on recognize a new epidemic i think that was my last let me see if i can stop sharing can you help me stop sharing the oh i have to do it myself because i'm trying to increase the size of the oh there you go okay thank you thank you nestor get it okay perfect thank you thank you so much nestor um that was a gosh uh i'm so appreciative of these reviews they're they're absolutely incredible and i think everybody else everyone every 116 others on the line are also so appreciative so really thank you so so much um i see marla seavers is on the line and i don't want to put you on the spot marla but i'm wondering if if you're you might want to give a any any update whatsoever you don't have to um just just let me know if you have anything at all to say from the new mexico department of health if not we'll move on to the questions with matt boshonville hi joanna i don't think i have any updates at this time no no problem our level anxious to hear from you on friday um dr beauchamville do you want to start with some questions yes uh thank you joanna thanks dr sosa for the for the overview too this is matt bouchanville and the first question is a vaccine-related question from amanda vigil in albuquerque um any any uh insights into the vaccine any updates nestor yeah i think in general i mean there are so many candidates i think the last time i reviewed there were 90 candidate vaccines different different mechanisms of vaccines some are basically good old inactivated viruses other are using dna and rna models to to uh so people are injected directly with the rna or or dna of the virus to in order to stimulate the cells to produce proteins all that are just protein products of the virus and they have been some uh both animal models uc macaques and and also some early human studies showing that some of these vaccine candidates was one from china using adenovirus showed the production of antibodies and some of these antibodies were neutralizing antibodies and also t cell response and and i think also the one from moderna has some preliminary data on human beings so so all of these vaccines are actually moving from from the pre-clinical studies to early human uh and animal studies and and very soon probably in the next couple of months they'll move to phase two and three which are larger studies in which they actually look not just for safety but also for efficacy of these of these vaccines but i mean nothing so far that can tell us that that we are in indeed uh ready to have a commercially available vaccine but they are moving they're moving through the faces and they're moving extremely rapid i have done vaccine research for many years and normally takes you know five seven years to develop a vaccine uh if if you're lucky enough that the vaccine works um so it's amazing that in a matter of just six months since this virus was discovered we are already talking about phase two and enrolling hundreds of patients in here the united states france and other china and other and other countries but i i don't have any anything more specific but in general the field is moving forward so far there are a couple of candidates that have demonstrated um antigenicity or the ability to produce antibodies immune immunity but still we need to see efficacy protection long-term safety etc before we can so throw a party and say that we have uh we have developed actually a successful vaccine all right thank you nestor uh another therapeutics question this one is from pamela daffern in albuquerque so anything you can share with respect to the convalescent plasma trial at unm yeah our convalescent plasma is not an efficacy plasma it's not an efficacy study we are first of all is an open label so we everybody knows who page which patient is receiving this we don't have an a comparative arm we don't have like a placebo arm uh we're simply enrolling patients and we our main goal is to actually measure the antibody levels and the neutralizing antibody levels both before and after the transfusion of plasma and before and also measuring the viral load in the respiratory surface before and after the administration of the plasma it's it is much more complicated to do a comparative trial because you need larger numbers of patients and you need a placebo one and so far what we have found is that at least the unit that we are transfusion and this is really very preliminary it hasn't been published but we haven't seen a significant increase in the neutralizing antibodies pre and post transfusion and we're gonna we're gonna publish probably we're gonna send the paper probably this week or the next week about this preliminary results obviously it's very hard to say if the if the patient are are responding because some of them have done well and they have been excavated uh but i think they have been out of the dozen of patients that we have given the plasma one or two that have uh uh dye so so so it's very hard to tell if it's working or not uh because we don't have a comparative arm but we are looking at pharmacokinetics and the dynamics of the antibodies before and after transfusion and we're also measuring the inhibitory aspects of the of the plasma itself over virus viral cultures in in our labs so so we will have we'll have preliminary results there was a there was a story i think um i don't remember it was jamma or lancet uh in which they analyzed uh convalescent plasma in over in over uh i think it was 50 in in one arm and the control and they found um you know some discrete benefit but nothing very dramatic we're still awaiting larger trials but it was so so sort of a a little bit disappointing the use of malaysia plasma maybe the patients were too sick or too advanced to have a benefit um but it was definitely not something that that that we expected with with this uh comparative trial all right thank you nestor and uh let's see this is a question from deborah baer in albuquerque um with respect to anticoagulation so could you comment on the use of outpatient anticoagulation especially for pregnant women well i i can i can speak in general we are we are using as soon as the patient is admitted obviously not for outpatients but for patients who are admitted with kobe we are starting uh prophylactic uh heparin or low molecular weight heparin and if there's any evidence of a hypercoagulable state or they have developed obviously a dvt or some other type of thrombosis they are receiving therapeutic anticoagulation there was a story out of spain a few weeks ago in which actually they compare they just need a retrospective look a large group of patients over a thousand patients that were treated in their hospital and they they actually compare those who receive heparin with those who did not no no specific doses not really um just you know across the board who got heparin and who didn't have heparin and interestingly enough they found that the survival rate of those who got heparin was higher than those who did not so i think there's there's uh more evidence obviously from from studies of autopsies in which we are seeing this microscopic thrombosis phenomenon in the lungs um that that people are incorporating into the routine care the use of anticoagulant i don't know specifically about pregnant uh females i i haven't seen anything specific about that and i'm afraid i would uh say something that is not right but it's it's if you have copied pregnancy or not you're probably going to be anticoagulated probably with heparin in the case of pregnant but i haven't read anything specific but i know that it's it's almost now standard of care to provide some degree of of anticoagulation to this patient to prevent a dvt's strokes and and also the most feared complication that the thrombosis in the in the capillaries in the in the lung and other organs which is associated with this um cyber concern and the more severe form of the disease all right thank you and uh back to you joanna oh thanks matt i i wanted to let um everybody know that this friday on our in our covet uh 19 multi-specialty echo um the presenter is going to be from uh the department of obgyn here at unm it'll be a maternal fetal uh fetal medicine fellow i'm talking about covet 19 in pregnancy so um stay tuned i think it'll be a really good talk and the case will be a case of i believe a pregnant woman with uh covet 19. so it should be a good a good session um there's been a lot of questions not only about cova 19 and pregnancy but also infectivity in the second stage of labor as well um but a nestor regarding uh your pr your presentation earlier today regarding some of the research that's been done there were some questions in the chat that i want to get to one was from um harry siebold and i think he's out of montana he says there's also an effect of prevalence i think in certain states idaho montana wyoming for instance on the positive predictive value meaning increased false positive rates um in some of the testing and didn't know if you might want to comment on that or not yeah sure yeah the prevalence of a disease obviously uh affects the positive predictive value of a test that's that's something that we know and it's it's uh it's not different with this disease if you apply a test uh that is imperfect let's say it has an 80 75 sensitivity in a population with a with a very low very very low prevalence let's say one percent and you find one or two people positive they're probably going to be false positive and that's something that we we have known i i always remember a professor i think i said this joke before that if you use a pregnancy test on on a population that it's all males and you have one or two positive that doesn't mean they're pregnant they're probably fall positive and it's because the no test is really perfect so it's the same thing here if you apply it to a person with a very high risk and you get a positive test your positive predictive value is high if you have a very low prevalence you know a patient who has not been exposed to kobe who's asymptomatic and you get a positive test you have a you know higher likelihood of that being a false positive as opposed to a true positive so so yes so the prevalence of a disease actually affects the performance and the interpretation of the of the results and you have to consider the pre-test power probability when you are evaluating the results thanks nestor um another a good question um you also had a chart looking at a symptom at the percentage of asymptomatic spread kind of you know the cruise ship iceland and various other regions and incidences and uh situations and lynn colemeyer i think from spokane said can you comment on asymptomatic spread being very rare there was a comment from on cnbc um where a physician from the world health organization said that asymptomatic spread is very rare um can you comment on that or have you i don't think i agree i i don't think i agree with the general statement first of all it's a little bit difficult to study uh how effective asymptomatic transmitters are they have been clear documentation of asymptomatic patients transmitted the disease to others because they have been like in this this analysis of contact tracing and these different outbreaks in which they have identified asymptomatic person they have identified secondary cases in the homes of those asymptomatic that were not in contact with the index case put it that way so so at least it had been documented the transmission um but it i i don't know if i can say with all certainty that is less than the symptomatic patient and in fact that's something that i have myself changed because i i thought if you're coughing and you have a fever you're more efficient transmitter but now we know that that by talking singing um if when you know if you're exercising and you're breathing heavily you can expel the virus into the environment so i'm not so sure that an asymptomatic doesn't trust me or trust me much less than others and in fact i saw a paper in which asymptomatic can be sharing the virus a little bit longer that those are symptomatic because the symptomatic develops sort of a more robust immune response and they tend to to control the virus sooner than those asymptomatic and another another comment that was made in this anal paper was that some of these asymptomatic although they're asymptomatic they have done ct scan and they have found in the in the x-rays abnormalities so so we don't know what what that means if they are asymptomatic but they do have some inflammation in the lungs what is the meaning of that inflammation so there's there's a you know a few things that we still need to know but i wouldn't say that asymptomatic do not transmit the disease they do transmit the disease um and and explain in some in some cases uh this um you know people who come to the hospital with symptoms and they were infected and they have no idea where they got it they have not been in contact with anybody sick but but they got a problem from an asymptomatic person thanks nestor um i'm gonna see if christian ramers um is on the line if he might wanna unmute and ask his uh question he's a physician in san diego yes i am can you hear me yes hello buenos dias nester and christian in san diego um i've there's been a group of doctors in san diego that have volunteered to go across to tijuana and help out with the situation there our capacity in san diego thankfully has been okay with kobit but not the case across the border and they're being overwhelmed and we're hearing even worse situation in mexicali which is about two hours to the east of us and really you know almost new york city style situation where they have hospitals being turned into covert hospitals and developing icus on regular patient floors and i'm just curious from your perspective and then also just from echo perspective what is going on on the border are you seeing it in the new mexico areas that are close to the border and then uh how how should we respond good excellent uh great great question no i i really actually do not have any information on the border i don't know if dr sivers or somebody else in the in the in the group can can respond obviously my my area of influence is here unm so i don't really know what i can tell you from the echo and we are working on on starting echoes in latin america there's a there's an effort and we're going to start doing uh you know these same activities that we do in english we're probably going to do for for our latin american colleagues because not only mexico but also uh central america panama for instance my country has had a second wave it's having a second wave and they have to come back to to social distancing and and quarantine general and there's also a large problem in brazil so so it's something that it's it's occurring throughout latin america um and and it's really of concern because i you know the social conditions in some more of the latin american countries are really very difficult i mean how do you tell a person who lives in a single room house with sick kids and the grandparents uh to social isolate or to to stay in your own room when you only have one room and seven people share in that room so it's really it's really very difficult a very difficult situation or tell them to stay at home when they have no income and the government is not giving any any help so it's really very hard and the social factors are are complicating matters in in latin america to a significant degree thanks dr ramers what i can tell you also um for i've been involved with a border echo which i started along with some other folks here um at project echo and we uh we've had it um every other week until the uh the pandemic hit and now we're we've been having it monthly and we're not sure how frequently we're gonna go back to but i work with travis leyva who's the head of office of border health in the new mexico department of health marla might know of travis but um i think the situation is not quite as bad in the el paso region interestingly dona ana county um has uh has had a slight uptick of of cases uh christian but not nearly as bad as uh what uh like the um gallup mckinley san juan county navajo nation um area and i think that when texas opened up uh it was thought that dona ana county which borders las cruces and el paso coming up from the border uh i think new mexico thought that we were going to get a really big uptick of cases in southern new mexico which which we didn't um but i'm going to after we our border echo meets tomorrow i'll find out more what's going on in the southern border of new mexico um i have a question ellen caro uh would you like to mute ellen caro and ask your talk about your um question then i'll turn it over to dr bouchonville dr crow might not be on a nut there we go no i'm muted there we go hi um john i'm sorry uh that question may have been asked some time in the past would you uh repeat the question and just again talking about asymptomatic cases asymptomatic kind of dance teachers had a 25 transmission cdc just put out an article uh this morning two days ago uh that was highlighted that shows a high degree of uh transmission rates specifically in a south korean study showing that zumba teachers teaching other zumba teachers for four hours in a close environment with high humidity and relatively high heat had a 25 percent transmission rate to other zumba teachers that contrast with south korea experience with both pilate and yoga teachers they have a several episodes several cases of identified individuals pre-symptomatic um with that were found to be coveted positive with just a few days of doing those classes class sizes ranging from five to eight low intensity perhaps not quite as high humidity with zero attack rate but again small so this the recommendation from cdc currently is avoid high intensity hyperventilation in tight quarters with large numbers of uh exercising folks present for a long period of time basically the same concept that new mexico has been been uh that doctors grace and others have proposed which is that this is a combination of proximity length of time of exposure and type of exposure that hyperventilation loud shouting etc singing similar to the the choir experiences is probably highly efficient at transmitting this disease whereas low intensity slightly more space and smaller group sizes decrease risk a significantly decreased risk of transmitting uh uh sars kobe 2. so i've sent that email to dr castman and the cdc uh uh contact will be available thank thanks thanks dr carl what i can tell you is um and perhaps marla can tell me if i'm wrong but i i know that uh gyms have opened up at uh 50 capacity but i believe that no uh gym classes no exercise classes whatsoever have been those classes have not been opened up even even yoga so i think we're being new mexico's being appropriately conservative but thanks thanks alan so much back to you matt all right thank you this is a transmission question uh this is from uganda um thank you for the question this is alice veronica asking the question but could you comment on why the curve is not flattened despite efforts that have been taken thus far this is in general or in a specific uh locality specified the question comes from uganda but it could be also in general okay yeah well usually i mean and marla can can help me with this one um you know because of the the under normal conditions this disease has a reproductive number of two or three so that means that one person infected uh if nothing is done in general as average will infect two or three uh other persons or people around them usually uh household uh companions or or or somebody who has close close contact with those person if you do significant efforts uh you know like social distancing and other interventions you can lower that transmission to less than one and with that you can you can um with time avail the epidemic or or decrease the epidemic or flatten the curve and actually not just flattening but stopping the epidemic but you need to make an effort to decrease that transvisibility below one because if you keep it at one one person will infect one and will give you a flat core you will have so if you have a hundred persons and they transmit you 100 the following week you're going to have 100 uh infected and the following week those 100 will infect another 100 and you just have a flat curve for every you know weekend and week out so you really have to to implement um measures in order to decrease that curve and as soon as you relax those measures and and the reproductive number especially the effective reproductive number goes over one you all obviously going to have growth of the number of cases i can tell you a couple of countries that have already started to open uh they were having a hundred cases a week um and and they as soon as they opened they went up to 200 and 500 cases a week so so that means that the the representative number is increasing so i think that's that's basically the explanation unless you do um a significant effort to decrease the transmissibility in the community you are going to have some sustained transmission uh even at the level of one that is going to keep the numbers steady for a while until uh you know we have a vaccine or there's like a heart immunity some other way all right thank you and another transmission question from lynn colemier and spokane can you comment on uh any updates on contact surface spread no i haven't seen any any uh updates uh about that i mean we there have been a few publications showing that the virus depending on the substance uh or the surface and depending on the on the environmental conditions can last from hours to days uh in general so so i think the tech take-home message is that although this is not the most common it's not thought to be the most common way you get the virus it is not impossible to get an infection if you if you are in contact with a with a surface that has the virus like a doorknob or or some other utensil and then you you bring your hand to your nose your eyes and your mouth you can inoculate the virus because the virus can can survive for for as i said from hours to even days in some of the surfaces and some of the studies so yes you can you can acquire the infection from the environment but haven't seen anything revolutionary aside from the the several studies that were done on survivability or viability of the virus in different conditions and exposed to temperature humidity and ultraviolet radiation all right and uh thank you so interested to hear your thoughts on this one this is from yasmin garcia in albuquerque is there any chance in your opinion that everything will go back to normal uh just like before what are your thoughts on that uh no i i don't think so at least until we have a highly effective vaccine um i mean we can pretend that we are normal but i think in order to to prevent a re re-uh resurface of the epidemic or or a second wave or a new outbreak we need to keep some uh social distancing using probably the mask and the community continue to increase with the hand hygiene and general uh you know public health measures i i see it very difficult at least in the next few months uh it's very hard to predict what's going to happen but definitely in the next few months because we have seen already outbreaks in in countries with with they have control like korea they have small outbreaks and other places in which are seeing a second wave like iran uh and some other countries in latin america so i think i i don't think we're gonna go back to normal right away for some time until as i said we have a vaccine or we have her immunity or some other unexpected phenomenon that occurs with the virus all right okay thanks and this is a question from pamela farber in miami can you comment on uh n95 disinfecting does disinfecting n95s decrease their effectiveness okay i'm not an expert on ppe to be honest with you i just can't stand what i have seen and they are they there are several health systems which are actually uh using some method to disinfect uh n95 we here at unm are using hydrogen peroxide and and there are some studies that show that that is safe obviously the more you do that there's always a sense of the of the mask being uh damaged the elastic bands being damaged etc so you can do that a few times you can cannot do it forever uh and there's also other other methods uh using ultraviolet light and other another method that have been uh studied and seems to be safe under obviously under this special condition in which we don't have an unlimited amount of n95 so so yes they can be reutilized they can be re-sterilized using some either chemical or or some other method obviously it's not an ideal situation most of these masks were made for one single use not for retro utilization but we have to do it because of the ppe shortages in all over the world so okay thank you and joanna back to you thanks matt um i'm wondering if dr sebold is available to ask his question about um post-hospital anticoagulation if he he might be able to unmute sure i don't know if you can hear me okay absolutely thank you um my question was uh just if you could comment the comment was made during uh your presentation about anticoagulation obviously not to treat outpatients but uh in contrast to that i was wondering what the current recommendations are about post hospitalization patients and those or treatment in this patient that have required anticoagulation during their care in terms of duration of therapy agent and doses yeah uh well thank you thank you for the question i actually do not know i would have to find out if our colleagues our outpatient management when they discharge the patient they actually because i haven't followed patients in the in the outpatient setting with covet so i don't know if they're sending them with anticoagulation or not i would assume that the patients who are uh that have a documented thrombosis like a dvt or or some other type of documented trombossa will will follow with anticoagulation like we do with any other patient but i haven't really i do not know i'll find out for the next uh echo what the protocol that we're using for like when you discharge somebody who has been treated with heparin in the hospital how are they managing the outpatient and the population if any if they're if they're giving giving it to them thanks dr sebold we'll get back to you on that um i'm wondering if uh dan saltman is um also available to unmute and ask his question uh hi thank you dr sosa very enlightening every week thank you so much for what you're doing uh i just i i i have a question i know that case fatality rates are kind of hard to calculate and that they certainly are population dependent you know if you're looking at a this population it can be high and that other population could be lower but how about in the in general what's what do people think how how deadly is the covet virus you know the tsar's virus and and how uh what what is thought to be the case fatality rate and how does that compare with other pandemic case fatality rates great excellent question um and i'll go a little bit historical when the epidemic was detected actually the information that we had was basically of the patient that had been hospitalized in china so the the initial the initial calculation of the of the case fatality rate was pretty high it was it was around 2.5 and i saw a publication up to 3.6 percent uh but these were patients who actually were hospitalized patient treated initially when we didn't know about asymptomatic transmission we were not sure uh about what was going on with the with the with the children that a lot of them have very mild diseases now that we know more and more that number has been going down so that the and we talk about the infection fatality rate and the case fatality rate the case fatality rate as those who are symptomatic and that's probably between one or two and two percent uh and as you have you correctly said depends on the on the presence of comorbidity and the age of the population affected the higher the age the more sick that population is regarding comorbidity they will have a higher uh case fatality rate and the infection fatality rate includes the asymptomatic so it's a the denominator is much larger and that's probably way below one so we're probably i've seen reviews of 0.9 0.85 um and obviously as we learn more and more and we see that they're more and more asymptomatic you can imagine that that two percent is going to be diluting out and it's going to be less than that um when you compare the mortality with previous epidemic probably the most similar phenomenon was seen with the with the h1n1 spanish flu who had a similar case fatality rate similar to around one to two percent of of those affected obviously the information that we have about the spanish flu is not as reliable uh because there was no biologic or or antigenic uh diagnosis and there were actually two waves one early in the year and then again in the fall so it's a little bit more complicated but in general i would say that this virus is behaving um in very similar to that most of the other pandemics of influenza including h1n1 from from the last one 2009 i think it was the mortality was much lower i mean less much less than one percent um so this is probably the most significant epidemic that we have had in the last 100 years regarding the transvisibility and regarding mortality or case fatality rate thank you nestor thank you for those thoughts thanks dr salton for that solomon for the question i really appreciate that wanted to remind everybody that um i believe the cme ceu link has been posted yeah it sure has just now and i'll just ask one more question and see where we are time wise um from irene berenstein what is what is being heard about the relationship if any between hepatitis c and coven 19 and i think perhaps um do patients with hep c have uh more complications with with cover 19. i haven't read anything i i would have i miss i'm missing dr torton today it would be a good day to have her to see if she has she's an expert on hepatitis c to see she helps review anything there are there are still a few uh groups of patients that we don't have much information there's not much information on hiv patients on patient renal transplant for instance they're very few communication i think we we need to to investigate more and obviously i haven't seen anything on hepatitis c either because we you know they are somehow immunosuppressed patients but we haven't seen in the large population you know large reports that have come out of new york and other countries i haven't seen a specific mention to that if it makes it worse or or has some other relation but i i don't know the answer thanks nestor i'm thinking that we need to get dr thornton to give us a presentation on one of our friday echoes on hep c and coven and then michelle andorio to give us a hiv uh and covet presentation as well i know michelle's been giving been giving several talks on hiv and coving so um thank you um back to you matt i don't know if you have can have time for one more question and then maybe nestor could close out sure let's see here's an interesting follow-up to a recent question this one is from lawrence curry on the quote back to normal um in in many ways is what led to the pandemic so what do you see as the major changes that we need to take to decrease the risk of other pandemics especially environmental in the future well that's that's that's a question for a whole lecture on the on the one health concept i think i i mean there are many things that we have to do obviously the world have to be better prepared um for once we need to convince the decision makers that epidemics can put countries and economies on their knees i think this have shown a clear example so i need more more pandemic preparedness continue to improve the communication between the countries so we so nobody has information about a new outbreak until it's too late i think that's that's another another thing there's definitely a concern about the number of coronavirus and bats in different countries in china uh and also the influenza they always the threat of another large influence of pandemic so i think animal surveillance and animal biology studies are key um and and learning those those uh jumps from one species to the humans how do the how it occurs and and if there's any way we can predict that when it's going to happen um but it's really really hard but i think from this pandemic we are going to learn we the community the scientific community is going to learn a lot about the response about the decisions that have been made even the scientists about how we responded to the publications to the low quality publications uh changing policy etc so there's there's i mean there's many many things that need to be really analyzed and thought and and so we are better prepared and respond better to to the next pandemic because if there's anything i mean pandemics are unpredictable but if something you can predict this is going to be another one and there's going to be another one anytime i mean the fact that we have a pandemic now unfortunately does not protect us from another from another uh pandemic in the next you know whatever five ten years so we need to be better prepared uh from from all point of view points of view all right thank you nestor joanna anything else um i think uh nestor do you have any last comments i might just tell the group about the upcom some upcoming other covet of related echoes any last minute uh no just thank you thank you for the questions i mean the questions are really interesting challenging and as you saw when i don't know the answer i've tried to look it up so probably by the next echo a couple of the unanswered questions i will do my best to find sometimes i don't find any information because the questions are so hard but i'll i'll try to to bring some information in the next about especially those who i couldn't answer you naster so much i wanted to let uh folks know that from two two o'clock to three o'clock today mountain time we have a first responder resiliency echo and that includes within that hour um listening sessions uh clinicians are actually separated out into different uh rooms and we tried it last week and it was quite successful so um it's we still have a didactic um and sometimes a case but we also have kind of separate uh listening sessions and then people are brought back to the main room and um and and reunited at the end and it's it was really worked out well on thursday mornings from eight to nine michelle harkins is still running her critical care echo which has been a really uh fantastic for the participating uh clinicians and then on friday as i mentioned a few times we have the multi-specialty echo from 12 to 1 mountain time and then at 3 30 on friday we have the community health worker echo in both english and spanish so i think that is it and uh wanted to thank again dr bouchonville for stepping in and of course nestor sosa always and marla sivers and everybody on the line who is uh doing so much so thank you all and thank you dr sosa see you next week bye bye,,6/8/2020
9,um i just have a couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started um as you all heard us say now many many times we love to see your faces so if you have a camera and can turn it on we'd like for you to turn it on for the duration of the session if you're able to do that um we also would ask that you just keep yourself uh muted um unless we call on you to unmute yourself that would be great uh well you if you have we know that some people sent in questions and we'll try to get to all of those but if you have questions during the uh during the session please put them in the chat box and we'll we'll we'll get them to dr sosa and the other experts that i see on the screen now that are here today with us and um we would also ask that unless we ask you to don't don't answer the questions in the chat because we want everybody to hear the answers to the questions so we will um ask that our expert panel when the questions do come in um lastly just wanted to let you guys know that uh kent nordsworthy our digital librarian will be putting all sorts of resources into the chat box so please keep an eye on that and and when you you can you can click directly onto those those um those links if you want to get more information so without further ado i'm going to go ahead and get started i'm i'm going to nester i'm going to go to nestor in just a minute but i just want to also introduce a couple of other people we have on on today with us um carissa call break is a medical director of infectious diseases at tri-core laboratory and carissa you have someone with you can you guys just introduce yourselves hi i'm laura i'm one of the molecular pathology fellows great thank you very much and we also have marla siverson who's in one of the infectious diseases epidemiologist at the department of health marla can you just introduce yourself before i go to nestor hi thanks carla marla sivers from the new mexico department of health thank you marla um and i'd like to introduce dr nester sosa who you all know well now who's uh division chief of infectious diseases at the university of new mexico and nestor you can go ahead and just you have some some things to share with us first correct nestor you're you're still muted can you hear me now yes we can okay good thank you i i think i can i cannot do two things like share the screen and immune myself at the same time uh first of all thank you everybody for joining again and uh thank you marla and carissa for being here and support uh all those uh public health and laboratory questions that that i have issues with answering uh yeah let me give you just a brief update first on a couple of comments i i don't know if if we these have been discussed in previous echo but we have started um during the severe varicity trial uh here in our hospital at unmh dr michele harkins is the principal investigator this is the continuation of the rendezvous the original rendezvous trial that dr faushi actually announced on tv so we're really proud to be able to run that trial we have enrolled the first patient already and we're looking for other patients with the with the inclusion and exclusion criteria this is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial that actually compares um reducibilities in both arms and we have our acetylene as the active new drug in in the in one arm and a placebo varicity which is an oral anti-inflammatory or immuno modulator and and we're going to see if if that helps the response of the rendezvous we are really excited about about this trial and hopefully add some more um information to the to the to the knowledge that we have about you know therapy of these of these uh infections uh regarding the review of the literature of the most uh uh relevant papers or the one that i i think they were worthwhile i'm just gonna go over this uh briefly uh first of all just uh i think a few hours ago um the fda revokes the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine is sort of the the you know another point against the use of hydroxychloroquine we already knew from from discussing some of the studies that especially the va study and a couple of the new york retrospective studies that that actually show no benefit and in fact show some increase in mortality especially in cardiac toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine so the fda have sort of uh pedaled back their their decision and now it's no longer authorized to use hydroxypro queen under fda emergency use for for kobe 19 uh that's something that we sort of uh knew it was it was coming at some point but now it's it's official so that's that's like sort of a headline more than anything um there was a nice paper for those who see kids um although i'm not a pediatrician so i'm not gonna discuss this paper in depth but there was this this review actually was published on pediatric pulmonology of a significant number of of pediatric cases with kobe and they described profile of the disease how many were moderate mild severe and and also the clinical presentation so i highly recommend this these um in pediatric pulmonology publication i think by a group in uh in portugal um and they actually listed the symptoms the symptoms are very similar to adults fever being the most common but only 47 percent of the kids uh cough 41 pneumonia or an infiltrate in the x-ray and and so on and so forth so they describe and this is just a regular copy presentation we're not talking about the the inflammatory multi-systemic syndrome this is just a clinical presentation on on on a cohort of of children in the different different studies that they actually uh summarized for us in this paper so i think it's it was interesting to have because we have a lot of the clinical presentation in adults but not so much in kids everybody just you know go by the generalization that it's a mild disease that that doesn't affect kids as as much but it's good to know what symptoms they they do have and what is more frequent in them and it's relatively similar to to adults really the other um i think interesting finding or or paper was a small letter uh in the new england journal published over the on june 12 right before the the weekend um in which they actually analyzed the pathology of 18 patients who die off of kobe 19 to see if there was evidence of encephalitis because that's something that because some of these patients have confusion agitation when they're in an icu and the conclusion of these 18 nautics is a relatively small number but they did a pretty thorough um both uh uh histopathologic immunohistochemical analysis and molecular analysis of the tissues and and their conclusion was that the the changes that they saw was mostly secondary to hypoxia and not really to encephalitis so apparently with this uh limited amount of of the data there doesn't seem to be a significant uh uh viral infection in the right viral infection of the brain but again this is obviously a very relatively small uh but well study uh autopsy series and that was their conclusion it was published in the new england journal in in the online on june 12 also uh the other the other paper that i think is interesting and this is mostly from from uh from an epidemiological standpoint also published in june 12 um was a a pretty good description of the natural history of asymptomatic infection that occurred in the in one of the in the crown prince's uh cruise ship they actually uh you know detail you know how long these patients were excreting the virus or how long they had a positive pcr once they were diagnosed and what was the real percentage of asymptomatic among those affected uh in that in that cruise ship so i i i think it was it was interesting one of the you know findings and this is something that we sort of uh suspected was that all patients had a longer excretion of the virus and this is what the graph actually it's a complicated graph but actually the the purple and the pink are the older groups 16 to 69 and 7 to 79 and they continue to have positive um pcrs longer than some of the younger uh uh members of the group uh so that's that's that was interesting so i i highly recommend if somebody's interested in like dwelling into into these the fact of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic they also mentioned that some of the patients in the in this investigation were asymptomatic at the time of the initial testing but then they developed uh symptoms so it's an interesting uh study that described this phenomenon of pre-symptomatic asymptomatic and how long are those asymptomatic patients creating because we know you know quite some more about those who are symptomatic because we study the hospitalized patients but really the asymptomatic uh subjects are kind of a mystery regarding how long do they excrete the disease do they have any other um like subtle findings despite their lack of symptoms and those things so it's interesting this this was also published in the new england journal uh in gemma gastroenterology hepatology there was a study about the prevalence of gastrointestinal uh synthetic this is actually a systematic review and meta-analysis in which these hepatologists uh review the literature on what is known about gi involvement and kobe 19 and and their their um their their main conclusion was i mean they reviewed 23 published uh papers and 16 print studies and they found that 12 of the patient reported gastrointestinal symptoms so so more or less one in one in 10 patient has some gastrointestinal usually diarrhea nausea or vomiting some of them 15 to 20 percent had liver enzyme abnormality and and a sizable percentage had a positive pcr 41 in the stools um raising obviously the the the possibility of of viral replication in the gi tract and also the possibility of transmission through through some other ways via fecal matter etc so so that was sort of interesting to see the gi people looking into their own uh issues and then as always i i usually bring sort of a different type of paper uh this is this was really an interesting paper it was actually polishing in a journal in of nature they call nature human behavior um and it's kind of provocative these authors actually this is mostly um done with models and and computer is not it's not with uh like using human subject were actually more uh analysis of modeling they actually suggest that because social distancing it's such a hard thing to do uh in general they suggest different ways to social distance and basically they call it social bubbles so instead of uh you know restricting people from interacting with others uh they recommend and they actually you know try to show some data behind this hypothesis that you can flatten the curve of the epidemic by limiting your social interactions uh just interacting with your family with your immediate co-workers and limiting yourself from like a broad multi-pronged interaction so this is really uh it was an interesting interesting paper and something that that may may have some practical you know for people who need to go to work who needs to um go out and not stay at home uh with some of the some of the you know um um rebounds of the epidemics maybe this uh sort of social bubble or or reducing your your social networking doing the the epidemic may be something that it's more feasible than than just complete stay at home uh uh social decent so i recommend this this reading uh um and then basically this illustration here has the the the typical social interaction that that that triggers uh you know one of these you know increase in the epidemic as opposed to this most social bubble in which people really interact with three or four other people um as opposed to like a large social uh interaction and that also shows that you can actually flatten the curve if you limit your contacts with people aside from the recommended social distances it's an interesting interesting paper so that's it that's all that i have um for now and i'm glad to go to the questions and discussion thank you you so much nestor i'm going to ask a couple questions that just came up in the chat because it's relevant to what you just talked about um on the pediatric paper there's a question from lynn colemeyer where were these primarily immunocompromised children or those with asthma that were infected or were they just were there as many healthy kids infected or whether i guess the the question is underlying conditions of those children right i don't remember i don't remember that point they just summarized the finding in the in the consecutive case that they they saw but i do not i don't remember really how they they spread i have to go back to the paper and see what was the percentage of affected kids with like asthma or some other chronic conditions but that's a good question i i do not know thank you nestor and that that paper is in the chat so if you want to go back to that line that would be great and um then another question um nestor was about what it says previously data from hong kong and south korea showed 44 to 50 of spread was from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic persons is that still the feeling with current data yeah i think i think yes i mean there was some sort of confusion last week uh one of the scientists of the wa show if you remember sort of said that that the transmission from asian tomorrow was rare uh but that really i mean the following day i think she corrected herself and said that she was referring to a specific data set in one of the outbreaks investigation i mean probably asymptomatics are not the main drivers of the epidemic that's what i have seen other experts uh comment on and marla can can help me with this uh but there's definitely evidence in some of the outbreaks and some of the investigation that asymptomatic patient can transmit the disease to a certain degree so it's not zero but it's probably not as high as a person who who's actually coughing and and spreading the the virus when they are symptomatic and have a relatively high viral load i know if you model you want to comment on that but i think that that's the the bottom line of the comments yeah thanks i i completely agree i think there was some confusion with the statements made um by the scientist from who that she attempted to clarify a bit but i think it's muddied the waters a little um for people but if you look at um you know the princess cruise line the paper that you showed nestor um what happened on the uss roosevelt the aircraft carrier and some other case studies where there were sort of these um you know big spreading events um the other one that comes to mind is the choir where there was a pre-symptomatic person who went to choir practice and infected a large portion of people in that choir we know that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread does happen um you know and it just sort of stands to reason that probably less often than someone who's coughing and sneezing all over everyone but through regular you know exhalation of respiratory droplets through seeming or yelling or just being in close proximity with someone a transmission is definitely possible thank you marla and then there's another question in the in the chat just about or is there can you are you distinguished distinguishing between pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic are you lumping them in the same group well in some of the studies obviously at the beginning of the of the outbreaks you cannot distinguish them because they are tested let's say that as an outbreak in a nursing home and you test everybody you're going to have let's say 20 of people with positive tests some of them will be asymptomatic but if you follow them some of them will actually develop symptoms so early early in an investigation uh everybody who says symptomatic and takes that's positively asymptomatic but then the more you wait you will see that some of those asymptomatic were really pre-symptomatic because they become ill as you and you as you continue the investigation so i think in some analysis they are a bunch together but then if you follow the the the process of the disease in a in the in the in the outbreak you can actually tell tell them apart because of the development of symptoms in some of them and others who are truly asymptomatic they they go on without any symptoms especially young and we have seen this in young people healthy as opposed to some of the older uh with comorbidities they tend to become ill even if you test them early and they're positive thank you nestor i think this is probably for both you and marla as well but um christian reimers asked if um if you had an unlimited testing capacity and a large workforce of contact ratios would you recommend that asymptomatic contacts of known cases get tested with rtpcr and if so at what interval yeah we deal two to marla i can make a comment but i really will deal tomorrow on that question because that's it's a really controversial thing um i agree and you know i wonder if carissa wants to weigh in on this as well um because i think there are sort of a lot of factors that you have to take into consideration um community incidents um testing symptomatic versus asymptomatic people the timing of that testing and really um distinguishing through your case investigation um you know what is a contact and who's really been exposed um i think you know in case investigations there's a tendency to both past a really wide net of people who are exposed and then people who want to be more conservative and not call themselves exposed when they really have been so i think sort of defining who's exposed um and then um you know some of the issues around sensitivity and specificity of the test when you're testing asymptomatic and people i think have to be considered and it is a complicated question i don't know that we have uh enough data yet to really make a clear recommendation but chris i'd love to hear what you think no i agree with what's been said i don't think we have the data right now to make a recommendation particularly challenging is knowing when post exposure to even begin the testing um if somebody tested positive uh yesterday um it's it's kind of unclear um you know when do we begin to test the potential contacts and what was the attack to begin the testing and then how uh at what interval should individuals um post exposure so i think a lot of the information right now is still uh feeling murdering um monitoring um we have very clear guidelines on what to do um so it's going to change as we learn more about the virus thank you everyone nestor did you have any any other comments or no no i totally agree it's i mean and the more you get into just testing in discriminate testing of asymptomatic the more confusing the situation is you know because you really don't know a person who's tested negative today may be positive tomorrow i mean if what does it mean that he's negative today so it's really complicated it's more clear when you're like have symptoms and and you can actually know that that person is it's symptomatic but when it's a cinematic and testing it's really controversial and difficult to say and that's i think why the authorities have not come up with a clear guideline for for all situations thank you very much i'm going to go into the um the pre-registration questions a little bit can you talk about it or let us know if there's any information on using anticoagulation therapy on the outpatient side or is it only still being done really in on in patients right i think i think i've been asked this i haven't been able to find um anything on that and if anybody in the in the shell can can provide and i can just remind what we do here we as soon as the patient is admitted we use prophylactic heparin uh but there's and and i asked even the the dr paratha was one of the internal medicines who's following most of these coffee patients they are not using outpatient anti-coagulation unless there's like clear indication the patient had a dvt while in the hospital or had a you know thrombosis of some type arterial or venous thrombosis but not as a routine nor do we have data on like the use of aspirin and other like you know less complicated uh platelet anti-aggregates as an outpatient and i haven't seen any literature to that i'm sure people are are looking into that if there's any benefit to that uh to use anti-population as an operation but i haven't seen anything either as a prophylactic or after the patient is discharged no none of those two situations i've seen anything written that i can provide thank you nestor just a couple other questions about treatment um have you can you talk about which hydrochloric hydroxychloroquine studies are active at unm now yeah i don't think we have any active i heard that we were going to start a prophylactic one but i haven't really get any information on that just to remind uh there was a double line uh placebo control study on prophylaxis using hydrostatic chloroquine as prophylaxis for for high risk exposure and show no significant protection there was i mean there was a like a 2.5 difference in the percentage of infected uh people uh in the hydrochlorine versus placebo but that was not statistically significant so i don't think there's any any real excitement about using hydrosuperchloroquine anymore in unm and i think that's the story that we have i think it's it's definitely on hold for now thank you nestor and one other pharmaceutical question can you talk about the utility of monoclonal antibodies and yeah there have been a couple i've seen at least i think two or three already monoclonal antibodies who have been a harvest or are initially you know neutralizing antibodies having harvest from patients who are convalescent and they have been able to to identify specifically some of the some of the monoclonals who are more active uh attaching to the spike protein and some of those uh antibodies are being produced as monoclonal antibodies in a sort of an industrial way and they are they have been or they are going to be tested uh as a therapeutic uh in the near future but i haven't seen any published efficacy study with monoclonals i know there are in the in the face of you know harvesting them developing and then testing in clinical and human trials um and we're definitely looking forward to see if they if they work uh there was a recent publication on the convalescent plasma and and um it was not very useful i mean it didn't show that much efficacy um so we we definitely are you know pinning our hopes in convalescent i'm sorry in monoclonals which are more specific and and you know highly neutralizing and hopefully more effective than than just using the convalescent plasma thank you very much nestor before we leave the issue of testing asymptomatic um people i'm just going to ask our colleague christian reimers who is our dear colleague from san diego who can introduce himself as an infectious disease physician um just to give us a little context about that question in san diego christian i'm sure you hear me okay yeah so the question comes from these county-wide data in san diego you know it's a county of over a million people and and our overall testing rate is looking really good it's three percent positive and it's been that way for weeks and yet i get on these calls with all the local fqhcs who are 10 to 25 positive rates and so there's clearly a disconnect between the hundreds and actually we're at 5 000 tests being run per day in the county uh that are being in my opinion mal distributed and so you know clearly we need to test closer towards the border that's where all the positives are and then i had this idea like why if we're if we have such great testing capacity why are we not directing it towards the context of those that are known to be positive rather than just reaching this number of 5000 tests per day and having the positivity rate be so low and my feeling is that there's probably people from upper middle income strata that are just wanting to be tested and they're asymptomatic and they go and they have very good access to health and we're not really directing it towards those who are close contacts of positive cases i think the bang for the buck would be much greater thank you christian marla did you either did you or um carissa have a comment about that carissa go ahead if you have a comment and you know if not i'll just add one thing i think um you know while it makes sense to test people you know who've been exposed especially if they develop symptoms i think just from a public health perspective um you have to consider how people will use that information and um you know ideally someone who is an exposed contact is going to be quarantined for 14 days regardless of their test results and we know that's really sort of the best path um rather than testing someone who's asymptomatic who may have been exposed i think the tendency for those people is to try to use that negative test as a rationale for um not continuing their quarantine and so you know the first guidance is always going to be quarantined for 14 days that way regardless of what their test is today or in the future they've limited their contact with other people and they're not exposing others and so i think that's just one of the practical considerations around offering a test to everyone who's a close contact because not available thank you very much so i'm going to introduce my colleague joanna katzman who just joined us it's co-facilitating and joanna did you would you want to go ahead and sure and i think uh the chat question i think marlon you you kind of answered that from philip hertzman um he said please discuss the new mexico experience with case tracing marla did you want to add anything to your comment uh you're you added on to what christian reimer said but do you want to add anything more to what philip um hertzman was wanting to know about sure i can just sort of share what you know the process is so every confirmed case so anyone who has laboratory evidence of covet infection is investigated by the department of health so that includes a interview with the case identifying who their close contacts might have been and then that contact list goes to our contact tracing team who reaches out to each of those people individually to let them know that they were exposed and provide them guidance about a 14-day quarantine as well as how to monitor their own health for signs and symptoms and how to get tested should they develop signs and symptoms that um case um or contact tracing team keeps in contact with that person throughout their 14 day quarantine it's mostly via a text platform now so people get a text message every day asking them if they've developed symptoms and they can reply yes or no to that text message and anything other than no gets followed up with a phone call from the contact tracing team so um you know we do really try to help people um adhere to that 14-day quarantine period through close monitoring of their contacts as well as follow up with confirmed cases every couple of days to monitor their progress towards being released from that isolation and the 14 day starts from the last contact so if you're a contact of a confirmed case your clock starts from the last time you had contact with that confirmed case i have a question a follow-up question how do you define contact i mean is it defined similar to like we do in the hospital like the person have to be ten minutes uh without protection except how how do you define that in the community i i'm curious yeah so if people were not masked you know not having any um source control and they spent at least three minutes within six feet of a known case we consider that close contact and we do a look back period for confirmed cases uh to 48 hours prior to their symptom onset or the date of their positive test if they're asymptomatic so we look at people that they may have had close contact with in the 48 hours prior thank you marla joanna katzman here again uh sorry i was late everybody um and phillip hertzman has one more question marlon that is how effective has it been in finding new cases with this uh with this method so cobia 19 is a reportable condition to the new mexico department of health so we get laboratory based reporting from all labs who identify a positive test and that typically comes to us via an electronic lab message that has patient demographics attached to it so um you know we have address and phone number for confirmed cases and so our first step when we get that lab report is to just reach out to the case by phone so that we can begin this process if we're not able to reach people by phone we have a few other methods where we can try to find that contact information um and if need be we'll send a public health nurse out to the address to try to make face-to-face contact with the person thanks marla and and one more question around this is um how did you come up with the three minute within six feet kind of standard it's a great question because it is new mexico specific so if you look at cdc's website um you know they started out they started just saying um prolonged contact without any sort of time frame around that and then they went to 10 minutes for some cases um and 15 minutes for others and now in the last week they've really aligned it to be 15 minutes um kind of across all of their different exposure definitions new mexico did adopt this much more stringent three-minute standard prior to cdc assigning a a clear time frame and um we have just stuck with that for the time being so it is different than what is in the cdc guidance and is new mexico specific thanks marla sorry sorry to interrupt can i just clarify one other thing with marla so i think the question the other question was about how effective has contact tracing been in in finding new cases like uh somebody who's who you're contact racing on if you found new cases yeah yeah so a lot you know a lot of our cases tend to um be clustered in families and households and so um through contact tracing it's not uncommon for those contacts to go on to become cases during the course of their 14-day quarantine period because often especially with stay-at-home orders the you know the number of contacts that people are identifying are smaller than they used to be because they're in contact with fewer people and those tend to be people um that they either work very closely with every day live in the same household with them or our family members that you know maybe they're providing care for or um seeing face to face frequently so we definitely do see clustering in families and households thank you marla um and thank you nestor uh so much for your questions as well um i think i'm going to move on to a couple more questions um from the from the pre-registration questions um just uh wanted to see if um perhaps nestor or marla or perhaps carissa you might know this some you know some countries are doing quite well in terms of their different strategies like new zealand and japan and i think even iceland and wanted to know um if you if their strategies might be a little bit different or one want to know kind of what they um what they have done um from a public health standpoint marlon maybe you might know this or nestor well i can take the first shot because in the martin remains island yeah i mean some of the countries especially in in in the east in asia uh they really have have used a lot of uh you know more stringent and the case of new zealand it's one really really strict social distancing they have also used electronic means to trace people i mean they use these apps that function using gps or or bluetooth in in and they can tell you know who has been close to to who and then they do that follow-up and in general i think um in other societies with much more uh sort of government that have more control over the people and less freedom people tend to to uh follow the recommendations more strictly and and it's sort of almost universal if you if they recommend mask it's universal mask no descent and if they recommend you know social distancing people really stay at home et cetera um so i think it's it's just uh the degree of implementation of the same measures i think it's much more thorough in some of these countries and and in fact the prime minister of new zealand actually thank the population for the level of cooperation he she talks about uh one team the new zealand team fighting covet and things like that so it feels like they are all following closely the recommendation without that much uh difference in opinion as we do here in the west in which there are there are uh you know there's always like controversy and and like some states do the one thing the other state does something different uh in those countries it's like just like you know like a vertical order and everybody follows them i think that helps because there's a lot of uniformity in the interventions um so you know with the com with the compromise that freedom is restricted but but they they get the the everybody uh following the same order so that i think that's in par it's a cultural and political thing thank you thank you nestor i'll ask one more question and then turn it back over to to carla um uh this is a question from uh uh vesta mizelle from from cortez colorado so since asymptomatic individuals uh might tend to carry less antigen is there protection from reinfection weaker than symptomatic individuals or do we know no i don't think we know much about the immunity of asymptomatic individuals i saw one publication in which the levels of antibody um but it was one just one publication and those who were hospitalized and sick were higher than the asymptomatic that recover but i think that's as far as i can tell i i don't really know what the natural history or the immunity in those asymptomatic if it's going to be less robust or more robust than those who are symptomatic and have severe disease i really don't know that except for what i mentioned about that paper that i remember in which they compared the the antibody the neutralizing antibody levels uh in some of these different populations and there was some some difference in the in the levels for the asymptomatic between between them and the and the symptomatic patients i don't know if karissa you can because you have seen publications on the on the serology if you can make a comment on that too yeah no i think i i agree with you completely i think the the thing that i will point out is that the um serologic test for antivirus right now um they do not necessarily detect neutralizing antibodies and that's really what we need to know about immunity and so even as we get more data um the tests will not necessarily be specific to neutralizing antibodies those may arise in the future so we should just continue to use caution when interpreting serologic tests as a method to detect immunity yeah just to ask something and i just remember we we are working on the on the paper for the convalescent plasma here in new mexico and what carissa said is totally right i mean we we received plasma donors from from patients who were certified uh positive i mean they they had the infection diagnosed by pcr either in the in the in the state lab or or tricus or they were real infection but when we and but we didn't have any neutralizing antibody level we just knew that there were patients who had recovered from kobe and we analyzed the the levels of of uh antibody of neutralizing antibody titers in the plasma and some of the some of the plasma had very little neutralizing antibodies it was really really low and we also measured the the neutralizing antibodies after the transfusion in our subjects and it was actually you know nine of them didn't didn't go up so so it's important i think in the future moving forward to actually measuring neutralizing antibodies in potential donors before we transfuse the plasma because you may be using a plasma that has very little antibody activity you know thinking that that that they should but they they not normally do so so it's important to to look for neutralizing on the body which are the ones that inhibit really viral replication at least in vivo thank you back to you carlos thank you um nestor could you give and just review the existing data on aerosolized virus and spread in absence of cough or sneezing see that's that's a tough one i i mean i i've seen so many different papers some of them are just that theoretically distance but drops can fly depending on their size and that um in some of the publication i mean classically we we have uh talk about this distance of a few feet but i've seen publications in which they actually show using lasers and other methods they measure that some of the some of the drops especially this the droplet nuclei can can travel even longer distance than that um but i really i mean i i don't don't feel that i can really uh give a an educated opinion on on the you know droplet dynamics and and how far and and how important the airborne transmission is with this virus i mean we still think it's mostly droplet relatively close contact despite some of these like the uh nice videos that we have seen of of you know respiratory droplets you know flying after somebody sneeze or cough or talks i don't know if marla wants to add anything but it's a difficult question and a controversial one to answer thank you marla did you have any comment uh no i you totally agree and i think it is really situation dependent um you know if a person wasn't coughing or sneezing what were they doing when they were expressing those respiratory droplets um you know are you in a place with relatively relatively good air flow and air exchange or are you in sort of more stagnant error i mean there's just so many situation dependent variables um i think it's a really tough question to answer right what they have done and probably the take-home message is that even cloth mask there's a now mounting evidence that using cloth mask diminishes transmission despite not being n95 or all the things that we have discussed there is now a lot of evidence from china from japan from italy how they were able to curtail the epidemic and how many cases were averted when they implemented this uh you know universal masking uh and that tells you that that although airborne uh may be important the the regular you know droplet big droplets short distance prevention it's it's also very important from a public health from a population health uh uh intervention so so i think if anything we should underline that that there's more evidence over the last few weeks of the importance of actually covering your your face when you are when you are interacting with others because of the asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission that can occur to protect others from from your own uh potential infectious virus thank you nestor i'm just going to go back just to one more question about antibody testing there was a question from julie broyles here in albuquerque karissa which antibody test is being used in new mexico and what is the sensitivity and specificity of the test um so i can provide a little bit of that uh information but maybe i can invite david grenache to come next week and talk a little bit more about antibodies um but we are using a test um by a company called deosorin um and in his evaluation um there was very high sensitivity and specificity greater than 95 for both and then he was actually able to test some plasma samples from patients who were previously positive with the common chronic viruses and so there was no cross reactivity so somebody had um you know a pre-covered non-sars kovi to a common coronavirus um earlier he tested that with the sars code v2 antibody test and there was no cross reactivity so we see very good sensitivity and specificity for the test thank you and i would mention that um actually this friday for the our our multidisciplinary echo david grenache is going to talk about serologic testing um and talk of specifically about the tests at tri-core so so if anybody would like to hear more about it they can definitely come to that echo at 12-1 on friday so thank you thank you carissa um the other question see about testing was yeah that's really the the main one well the the actually there's maybe marla can speak to this there's a question about what are the latest recommendations regarding testing for new mexico residents and it's people been alluding to this but can you talk about that a little bit what the what the doh is still is recommending um i would say that you know it changes quite frequently and so i understand why people are kind of struggling with this um you know there are specific recommendations for defined populations um such as uh nursing home residents and staff um you know that are really specific to that setting of care um and just sort of the underlying fragility of that population and you know the amount of deaths and hospitalizations we've seen associated with nursing home residents as well as just the rates of transmission within those facilities so there are some specific recommendations um from cdc and from the department of health uh for baseline testing um you know before we start reopening to assess uh prevalence in nursing homes and um new mexico department of health does have a have a plan um for some continued um just sort of random sampling in nursing homes for some ongoing monitoring uh similar to the current approach for um corrections facilities again you have you know a very confined population um where social distancing and some of the other interventions like masking and hand washing are problematic and there are a lot of barriers for that so there are some specific recommendations for facility-wide testing along with ongoing monitoring in those locations and i think there were in last week's press release um some attention given to people who are essential workers um people who work in food service so that could be grocery stores or restaurants again where you are having a lot of contact with the public and social distancing can be a little more um challenging uh to try to ramp up testing among those groups thank you marla back to you joanna thanks carla thanks marla and nestor and carissa for all your great questions and answers um i'm gonna go now to some kind of questions around uh just various questions actually um this is a question from deborah bear kind of about i think uh estrogen and kind of risk of thrombosis during uh if you if you get coveted and that is should women on estrogen-related birth control stop this or switch to progestin only or non-hormonal methods kind of if they it's not clear if the question is if they have covid or might be at risk for developing a covet and i think the idea is if because of estrogen-related kind of clotting just wanted to know kind of nester what your thoughts are right i haven't read anything i'll give you my my opinion i mean the the first of all the coagulation problem it's most prevalent in severe cases so so i mean i don't i don't think you can just generalize that all all females that are in risk of of kobe need to stop their astrologians or or change their their birth control strategy just because of that obviously a different story is if you're already with kobe severe in the hospital uh that's another story and then obviously any pro coagulant or anything should be uh probably considered to be discontinued but i don't think like a general strategy to to change that because the risk is low i mean the risk of getting severe calling across the board it's less than five percent and then on top of that you the risk of having a serious thrombotic event is also relatively small so i think when you we start looking at those percentage you probably cannot come up with like a general public recommendation but completely different in an independent i mean individual decision of a patient who's taken estrogen and it's with kobe then may have a thrombotic event that's that's a completely different situation thank you master and i would say that um we had a great uh covet 19 in pregnancy talk last week at our coven multi specialty echo and i believe that the same uh uh trevor quinner and dr yoder are gonna do the same presentation i i believe at this week's critical care echo with dr harkins so i think that they're going to do a repeat um kind of a repeat talk on that um so that was that was very well done and dr hayes is in our i think she's on the line right now and she's also part of our multi-specialty cover echo i wanted to ask a question that also came on one of our pre-registration questions about n95 masks we talked about nestor you talked about cloth cloth masks being very protective um if the the person who's wearing the cloth mask it's very protective against preventing um the person wearing the cloth mask against spreading their own um their possible possibility of spreading you know shedding their own their own virus but what about um you know what about does it protect um does it protect um you know others from uh you know if you're around if you're not wearing a mask um does it protect uh you and the same thing goes with an n95 mask does n95 mass only protect the one who wears it but not others can you kind of um talk about the difference between cloth mask versus n95 mask if you're wearing yeah i'm going to talk in general i think marla can also help me on these obviously n95 uh and and other mass that that filters um most of the particles that are in the environment provide a much higher protection than a cloth mat a cloth mat depending on the material it has large pores so you can in in theory you can inhale uh some of these particles that are floating in the air and if the particles the droplets have virus you can be infected uh by by inhaling them because they do not filter those small as opposed to n95 and some others that are used in europe uh ffp 2 and 3 which are like similar to n95 to a certain degree they do filter if if you have a good fit of the mask and you don't have a beer etc you you can you can actually protect yourself from getting the virus because you're not inhaling those particles with the virus they they get stuck in the in the structure of the mask and you are not exposed to to them uh as opposed to the cloth mask which they convert some degree of protection um but most of the projection is containing your your large large droplets uh from from being expelled and falling in somebody else's face mouth nose or eyes so that that's what it's the the science support but we know that the just clothes mask and surgical mask and procedure mask obviously converts some protection uh even if they're not n95 uh to to acquire an infection because they are a barrier better than nothing uh in and and they have different degrees of filtering abilities and electrostatic properties that trap some of these particles so so that that's that's i think the the the message uh that the cloth mats are not you know protected but they do reduce your your setting of the virus 895 are both you know protect you from spelling and also from inhaling or acquiring the infection thank you nestor um i might ask uh this question might be better towards carissa and i'm not sure if it's already s yet because it came out a little late but can you comment um on the progress towards a point of care covet testing that might be used for instance at in ambulatory clinics more widely or at fqhcs carissa or marla so there are a couple of um point-of-care tests that have already been cleared um of course the avid id now has received significant press um both both positive and negative they're they've released some um early data that they've generated from a few uh different settings some urgent care clinics um that show better performance than was seen um in the paper that came out of uh new york um so i think avid is still working to generate some additional data on the id now and its use um in in diagnostics um there's also a test from quadell called the sofia that is a point of care test uh that is an antigen based test uh it has about a 90 sensitivity and it's recommended that negatives uh be confirmed by a molecular method so that's a little bit difficult in a low prevalent setting when maybe only one or two out of a hundred you know one or two percent positivity rate uh would actually be positive um most of those tests would have to be confirmed uh so there are still uh many uh point-of-care tests in development uh both antigen-based point-of-care molecular point-of-care and serology point-of-care uh that are in development and will hopefully be ready as we enter into the fall flu season that's great news carissa thank you for updating us and i just wanted to mention that when we were talking about n95 masks uh dr ramers from san diego mentions to beware of um these n95 masks that have one-way valves typically for industrial uses um um some of them are clearly not safe as his chat describes wanted to mention that the cme was posted about 45 minutes after the hour and we're checking in to see if it was um to see if it can adequally be um if you can adequately access it someone suggested that it might be blocked but we're looking into that um carla do you want to see if nestor and carissa and marla might have any last minute comments we're about five minutes towards the top of the hour uh nestor or marla carissa any last last minute thoughts for you i wanted to wanted to mention also that uh dr harkin's talk this thursday is not on um pregnancy and and and covets it's actually on cytokine storm so it should be a really interesting talk i'm not sure who the presenter is but a week from thursday it's on pregnancy and covet i'm sorry nestor no i just wanna like like always thank everybody for the participation and their interesting questions and um you know we'll we'll continue these uh activities and and you know searching for the latest evidence and try to solve as many questions as possible and i see a couple of questions in the chat that that were left and so i'll write it down and address the next monday i think if you want to answer them i think please go ahead i think we have a couple minutes there's one com question i think by leslie hates that i found very interesting uh about about the neutralizing antibodies and severity of disease and it's it's a complicated topic and her question is precisely um that there have been publications uh um describing that neutralizing antibodies may decrease the severity of disease but not prevent infection um and if that is going to affect like like hurting immunity and i think yes but but to a certain degree if we if if we have enough um neutralizing antibodies in the population even if it prevents death and severe disease it's a it's a great thing and that's what we do usually with vaccination with like influenza vaccination and other that that actually the the main effect of those vaccination is to produce this protection from severe disease like pneumococcal vaccines and other really protect you because they diminish mortality without significantly diminished the overall number of infections people get a milder disease and and if we if we get that from hurting immunity from neutralizing antibodies or from a vaccine it's obviously a great thing because one of the most important issues with this disease is the number of hospitalization the number of icu bets and obviously the number of death that we are seeing you know across the world so so even if we don't get like like a sterilizing immunity if we're safe from severe disease is a great thing to have thank you nestor carla do you want to close it sure thanks joanna so thanks everyone again um just wanna just as a reminder uh so what joanna already said and i already said about the serologic testing but we have two more covered echoes this week one on thursday from eight to nine and with michelle harkins our pulmonary critical care chief and it's the topic is gonna be cytokine storm so that should be very interesting and then on on friday as we mentioned uh david grenache will be on to talk about serologic testing and um we're excited about that there's also a case that that has to do with serologic testing so it'll be it'll be an interesting echo for sure and then of course um we have office hours again next a week from today with dr sosa so yeah thank you everyone and just a reminder about the cme link and also to go to our echo website um if you're interested in finding more resources there's a lot of other covet echoes going on that aren't new mexico specific that you might be interested in as well from health and human services and there's a resiliency echo this afternoon um from dr um jeff katzman is the medical director for that and that is the two o'clock correct two to three and the topic actually is the effect of coven 19 on um on actually um early childhood and taking care of kids during this stressful time it's it's the um the presenter is dr anila del fabro the chief of pediatric psychiatry here at unm great thank you so thank you again everyone and we will see you soon nestor's putting his mask on so he has to go it looks like so we will see everybody next week or maybe later this week thanks everyone you,,6/15/2020
10,we're really happy to see everybody today um we're gonna go ahead and get started i just have a couple of uh housekeeping announcements um we as you all know we've asked this every time but if you're new to to this um new to our office hours we would like for you to turn your phone on i mean your video camera on if you have it we like to see people's faces and i think it helps to build community um we'll try our best to get to the questions that you put sent in if you did put questions in the pre-registration we'll also be accepting questions um about um that anyone has that didn't do pre-registration as pre-registration questions so please use the chat box to submit any questions that you have for the the hub team um and we would ask that you refrain from answering if someone asks a question in chat please refrain from answering that yourself and let one of the hub team the hub team members answer that question thank you um also our uh digital librarian kent will be putting things into the into the um chat box links to resources so please pay attention to that as well there's a lot of interesting thing that goes into that as well so and just if you have any if you'd like to see any of the videos from the previous sessions or any of the coven 19 related resources and sessions we have please go to our website um and you can find all of that there so again welcome everyone um i want to just introduce um myself i'm carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm and also want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman or johnny you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody joanna katzman i'm a neurologist work with dr thornton thank you and i'm going to turn it over to dr nestor sosa he can introduce himself and he has a few slides to share with us today before we go to the questions hi good afternoon everybody my name is nestor sosa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm hospital yes let me see if i can share my screen yeah i can okay so i'm gonna go uh over a few of the most recent uh publications but before i do that um i think in the last echo session last monday i was asked um a question regarding the duration or the viability of the virus in different surfaces and i wanted to bring back this uh this article that was published in the new england journal uh already a couple of months ago uh by dorian mallon is the the main author and these these um actually uh graph illustrate the duration in different material and they used um a temperature of 21 to 23 centigrade environmental temperature and uh and um 40 humidity and you can see uh the in in the air or in aerosols the the virus can last for up to three hours and then in the other material it's it's um it varies for instance in copper and carbor tends to last less or or it's less stable and you can see in copper it really goes down before um 10 hours in cardboard it can last you know up to 20 hours stainless steel and plastic are probably where the virus persists for the longest and you can see that they are still uh you know detectable virus at 40 and 60 hours in in some of these uh experiments and and that's in the upper on the upper part on the lower part of the half-life of the virus in the different materials and you can see that in aerosol it's a matter of hours and copper also it's pretty unstable but then when we go to the other material you can see that it ha it has a half-life of of a longer half-life especially in stainless steel and plastic so i wanted to sort of review that just to remind this is one of many publications that have evaluated the the viability of the virus and as i said this this obviously changes with the conditions the environmental condition the exposure to uv lights and other factors but this is sort of in an experimental setting how it looks um in different materials um i i want to say i i think i've mentioned already the recovery trial in one of the previous but the recovery trial was made available in the p publication pre-publication uh um repository the metrics um and and i wanted to go into more detail so you can actually um um if you if you have to decide uh you have a little bit more information if you have to decide on the use of dexamethasone and just to to review this this is a study out of the uk uh it's actually an open label randomized not blinded which is important control adaptive investigator initiated trial it was conducted in 176 different hospitals within the united kingdom and the sponsor the official sponsor is not a pharmaceutical it's actually oxford university and just to to remind uh what what the what the british did with this uh with this approach is that they they actually randomized patient to different treatments including lopino return avail hydroxychloroquine and other and one and they have only published the results of this arm and they actually treated 2 104 patients to dexamethasone and the dose was 6 milligrams every day for 10 days and then there were the control group was 4 321 patients that received usual care and usual care means none of the investigated none of the none of the treatment that were considered uh drugs of under investigation so it was sort of a control and then the primary endpoint was pretty um clear it was 20 28 day all course mortality so it was relatively simple they did uh um use like an electronic medical record to to gather the information on mortality and that's what they analyze at their their main endpoint and what they found and i'm going to show a few graphs a few kaplan myograph and you can see the percentage of uh mortality the first number is the number with with dexamethasone versus control or no dexamethasone and you can see that overall there was a decrease in the mortality um or the percentage of of of 28-day mortality from 21.6 with the dexamethasone and 24.6 for usual carry and this was a statistically significant if you see the confidence interval they did not cross one so so dexamethasone was protective although you can you can argue that it was in the in the group as a whole it was just a three percent um decrease um in total if you look at the patients that receive oxygen there was also um a difference but this was not a statistically significant so in patients with really mild disease that were hospitalized there was no statistically significant and in fact if numerically the mortality was higher with dexamethasone in that in her arm but that was not significant if you look at those who are receiving oxygen only or mechanical ventilation uh you can see that the difference was significant in both cases favoring the use of dexamethasone so less mortality especially in the group that receive uh invasive mechanical ventilation you can see 29 um with dexamethasone 40 without makes up dexamethasone so a very um a larger numerical difference and and also not only numerical but also statistically significant and and this is in fact the first drug if this paper is approved and published it will be the first approved and published public a publication uh with uh with a mortality difference because if you remember the rendezvous trial the nih rendezvous trial showed a shortened uh duration of disease but no statistically significant advantage in mortality so so this is the first paper that actually shows this um uh difference the only or one of the caveats of the study is that it's not blinded so you can make an argument that was sort of a bias towards um dexamethasone and and and because this this was a study actually uh done in in the uk throughout the uk uh probably that you know it was not as strict as a very uh you know investigation investigational trial conducted in a in a in a more controlled setting this is in the middle of the of the pandemic but nevertheless um the findings are are are significant uh from a statistical standpoint the other interesting publication uh it was actually published in the mmwr and i think we mentioned it in the friday multi-disciplinary echo and it was about the characteristics of women of reproductive age um and copied regarding their her pregnancy status this is actually sort of the result of a you know national surveillance done by by cdc in which they they actually have had information on 326 000 females aged 15 to 44. uh they have tested positive for stars kobe 2 by pcr they had information on the pregnancy status on 91 000 of these patients and in fact eight thousand two hundred and seven were pregnant nine point zero percent which is um somewhat higher than than the than the usual number which is a across population at a single time is usually five percent um they also found that there was a higher proportion of hispanics and black pregnant with kobe than non-pregnant females so that was one one of the findings so so and it's similar to what we have seen regarding um severity of disease and and frequency of the disease in different population that hispanics and blacks um are overrepresented with copy 19 some of the other important finding was that 31.5 of the pregnant females were hospitalized we called it were hospitalized as opposed to only 5.8 so this is almost a 5.5 times higher um risk of hospitalization uh in pregnant females with kobe then non-pregnant females would call it obviously this study did not correct for hospitalization due to obstetric reasons so there may be an over representation of of hospitalization not because of copy but actually because of labor and delivery or some other obstetric complication but it was nevertheless five times higher and after adjusting for age underlying condition and race and ethnicity they found an um an adjusted relative rate of icu admission that was 1.5 times higher in pregnant uh compared with non-pregnant and also mechanical ventilation 1.7 in pregnant uh compared to non-pregnant uh patients so so there was different you know different frequency of icu and mechanical ventilation indicating that probably disease is more severe in pregnant females than non-pregnant females fortunately there was no difference in mortality despite these these differences in in icu and mechanical ventilation there was a 0.2 percent mortality across both groups so it was identical that the the frequency of mortality but this is this together with the study in sweden there are at least two published studies that that actually points to a more severe or complicated course of copy 19 in pregnancy and then the other interesting story was the zero prevalence you probably heard in the news the sort of prevalent study conducted in different actually six places six different places in the united states uh and i just wanted to to mention this percentage because there's really uh probably higher than expected in in some in some areas um for instance in the in the new york city metro region they did um this zero program was around seven percent so seven percent of those um and these were patients who actually attended uh labs for other reasons and they they took the residual plasma and they actually tested for antibodies and they found a seven percent if we apply that seven percent of the to the population of the of the area um we would have expected a 12 12 times higher number of cases than what was actually reported to the health authorities so we're probably under diagnosing the under diagnosis and covered in many of this area you can see connecticut was 4.94 missouri 2.65 and in all these cases uh obviously the number of cases the real number of cases it's many times higher six times or 24 times higher what has been uh actually reported using the the diagnostic algorithm that we have utah 2.18 south florida 1.85 and western washington state 1.13 in all those cases 11 times higher number of of persons um have been infected than were actually detected with with the regular uh testing algorithm as i said so an interesting finding obviously all of these numbers are pretty far away from her immunity where you know most of the publication agree that in order to have her immunity you need a 40 to 60 percent or maybe even higher percentage of the population affected uh but nevertheless um tells you tell us the magnitude of the of the epidemic in the united states and finally i always bring a story or something that is kind of offbeat or or surprising uh in this case this is again a pre-published study so so i would take it with a lot of skepticism but the the a group of investigators in barcelona actually um analyzed the wastewater they did pcr of the wastewater of two treatment plants in barcelona and they obviously did it through the epidemic from from january on and they found there were cases earlier um than than recorded by the by the public health authorities but the most surprising finding was when they look back at the at the wastewater uh samples from the year 2018 and earlier in 2019 and they found and this this needs to be actually validated and and hopefully investigated in other cities but they found up one day in march 2019 this is march 2019 not 2020. march 12 2019 they found in the wastewater uh six to the 6.4 to the uh um and an 8.3 um copies of ip2 and ip4 which are the polymerase of the of the of the new coronavirus so so suggesting obviously if this is uh if this results is real that probably the virus has circulated even before it was detected in china but again this is this this pop this paper has not been published it needs to be criticized this could have been or some other um you know irregular result but it's nevertheless provocative and i think people in other in other countries are looking back at this type of analysis and try to find um circulation of the virus before december or before november of 2019 i think that was my last yes that was my last okay we can go [Music] thank you so much uh thank you so much dr sosa um fantastic as as usual um you're providing so much great information and we all are really i think getting uh getting accustomed to looking forward to this every monday morning so we really appreciate this nestor i'm gonna this is joanna katzman here and i'm gonna start with some of the chat questions that um that came in um the the first chat question dr so says from nancy brooker um and uh she says what is the recommended core amount of quarantine time after hospitalization for covid19 and i'm is it is it related to possibly the the cdc guidelines after kind of two consecutive negative tests what what might how do you think about answering that one yeah first i mean if a patient has been hospitalized with uh with uh cobin 19 we we prefer to use the term isolation because this patient more than quarantine is used when the person doesn't have the disease to prevent the disease from being transmitted if it has been exposed but in reality it's more of an isolation and yeah there we have discussed this in the past that usually um you have to wait a certain amount of time from the moment of the diagnosis and this has been changing but i think the last time my review was 10 days and you have to have also three days of being asymptomatic a favorable and with improving respiratory symptoms that's that's the the clinical um scenario or the symptom-based uh scenario if you go the other there's another way and it's actually testing the patient once the patient is a febrile and it's been a ferro for 72 hours you can do a pcr testing and you have to have a two negative tests in order to to confirm that the patient is not infectious anymore but i would say most of the places and and we are tending to use more the the clinical based uh algorithm because we have and we have these causes in the echo there is a percentage of patients that keep screening rna of the virus and that doesn't necessarily mean infectious virulence but actually just particles or part of the of the rna so so a lot of places are tending to use more the the clinical and the time based more than a laboratory based testing thanks thanks dr sosa um it makes a whole lot of sense and yeah we we've we've gone through these uh scenarios but i i think that they're still kind of uh confusing as they have changed actually a few times from the cdc so thanks for kind of reminding us all um dr caro asks a very interesting question and i looked this up myself this morning dr caro do you want to unmute and ask and uh talk about this for a second yeah um a big surprise to me that there's an adenovirus derived vaccine that was approved uh early this morning uh called from a company called can sino biologics is a combination canadian and uh chinese uh biologic manufacturer and the chinese have approved that for use with the people's liberation army and apparently they're starting like today in their uh to start vaccinating uh joanne has the the data from a may uh summary but the the thumbnail was um it's better than nothing but it's not a game changer especially for older folks uh because it's adenovirus based it's uh a problem uh it's only uh obtaining a high level of neutralizing antibody 50 of those who are of young people that are vaccinated with a medium dose specifically 50 billion um adenovirus units associated with the um a component of the spike protein uh the canadians have this in uh in trial but the apparently the chinese only did a phase two 500 folks and the downside was 81 of those folks had a major reaction and one percent of them had severe fever no one died um so anyway they they're pulling the the trigger and the expanding they're gonna give it to the young recruits um thoughts on a virus that is only capable of producing 50 percent or a high level of neutralizing anybody 50 percent of those who get it and that it doesn't seem to produce much in the way of a reactivity in the folks that are high risk nearly the elderly thanks dr carl any thoughts nest no i mean i i'm surprised that they have gone ahead and used it in a larger population um that probably wouldn't fly here in the west it's they're difficult because of safety uh we need more than just a few hundred patients treated um the other issue is that if you if you have been infected with adenovirus you may have a less of a reaction even if you're younger so that's another limitation of this usually mix uh virus vaccines in which they use the the cover of one virus and the material the genetic material of another so that's an even limitation obviously if we have nothing better if nothing better comes along i probably gonna have to retract my words and say okay this is the vaccine that we we have to use but i think you know i hope that we we get you know better than than that type of protection and obviously uh you know if you get less than 50 percent of the population you're probably going to still have um circulation of the virus according to the most epidemiologic models and and and obviously as you mentioned if the if the more vulnerable nor protected by the vaccine and you don't get enough her immunity you're not going to solve the problem completely i mean you may palliate or improve the epidemiological situation but you're definitely going to have a still circulation and issues with with uh with the kobe 19 so i hope we we can we can do better than that but i you know we'll see what the results in china are thanks thanks dr sosa i want to see if maybe um dr marciniak from the department of health might be able to answer um a question that came in about the recent explaining what might be the recent cause of some surge in bernalillo county new mexico but i might open it up to if dr marcinia can just speak to some causes of why we've had some recent uptick in cases in new mexico in general are you available dr marciniak uh yes i am if you can hear me yes we can um yeah no it's uh i don't think we have a you know a specific explanation for the you know increasing cases in bernalillo county and the albuquerque area um i think it may you know that we did have some listening up of the restrictions and opening up of the stores and that's why the governor this past week uh put the further opening on on hold and so that may be the one reason i mean we do have you know this is a tourist season and we do have people driving into different areas and flying in i mean they're if you fly into new mexico they're still uh it's a it's a required two-week quarantine but it's very hard to enforce if you're driving into new mexico from other high prevalence areas you're actually supposed to it's recommended to quarantine but i said the the particularly the people driving here it's uh it's almost impossible to enforce those quarantines because we you know we don't even know who's driving in from out of state um i think some of it may be due that they said to the increase in tourism and you know we're still doing a lot of testing so i mean if we're seeing lots of cases from increased testing and mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic people that will increase the shear numbers but the way i understand it from dr harkins and dr sosa is that there's not really an increase that much in the hospitalization rates if i may be wrong about that of in the albuquerque area it's not it's not you know dr harkin said in a previous call it's not because there's still ongoing cases in the navajo nation area area those cases would actually be counted to the navajo nation and they wouldn't really be counted as bernalillo county patient very covet cases um in other areas of the state i mean we're still dealing with a very large outbreak in the ice processing facility and the otero county prison in chaparral new mexico where they're well over 700 cases right now and i think it just demonstrates the difficulty of controlling covet in this type of setting when it's very difficult to you know next impossible to do social distancing and it's very difficult to discharge large numbers of detainees in those facilities but we have um you know at least two epidemiologists that are focusing on those two areas and and you know and just being in close proximity to the el paso area i think that's what's driving up some of the numbers in the southern new mexico and the region where i work thank you dr marcinia very very helpful um could you help me could you help us with one more question a question came in that you um that um someone asked what what makes a covet contact i mean what epidemiologically perhaps what um what would you describe would be a covet contact um yeah i know it's it's it's similar to what we do with other epidemiology you know other reportable conditions it's really you know how close is the contact and how long they've been into contact with the you know with the case of the covet so i mean if you live in a house you know if you're a family member obviously you're going to be a close contact because you have extended close contact with that with that case however in one of our southern one of our small cities they closed down the whole police department for a few days because one of the one of the workers there actually had coveted um but you know even though they may be in the same room with them you know with essential workers they're they're not you know we don't necessarily exclude them what happened what we what we do in cases like that is we identify all the people that were in contact any type of contact they get tested um if they all test negative then they're allowed to continue to work with mass and precautions um and so it's really it's it's uh it's really the length of time and what kind of you know what kind of contact it was thanks dr marciniak um very very helpful um i think this next question might might relate to dr uh sosa you might be able to help us uh with this um and that this is from um i believe uh margot rule that says um we've seen immunity to copen19 uh decreases over time in some instances is there any information on how long an individual may be immune following an infection um i think if not kind of forever i mean are there some patients that maybe do not have immunity for for life what is your feeling about that nestor right there there are several several things several points uh first of all uh we know from other coronavirus from the endemic coronavirus that immunity doesn't last forever so if this virus is going to behave as previous coronaviruses uh especially the endemic one the one that have been associated with common coal they seem to the immunity seems to go down with time so that's one thing i don't think we have uh for sure a definitive answer what's going to be the story with this coronavirus with stars kobe 2. i have seen papers in which people actually mount a pretty decent uh immunological response with igg iga igm documented and even neutralizing antibodies in an important percentage of patients not nor in all of the studies they produce a neutralizing antibodies but a great majority of patients seem to produce an immune response i think i don't think we know for sure i i actually saw a press release saying that the immunity goes down after two months but i haven't been able to find the reference that actually supports that uh that uh communication in the in the late press so i think we need to be just on the look for for actual studies that measure the duration of protection and the duration of protection can be evaluated just with labs so doing you know neutralizing antibodies or actually having people exposed uh of recirculating virus and not being infected the second time around so i think we we have to wait a little bit more this this virus has been you know circulating for just over six months according to the official uh reports um so we need to wait probably longer to see how long the the antibody protection is gonna it's gonna occur but we have some evidence that there's protection there's also animal models which have been animal uh macaques specifically they have been infected with sars cov2 and then they are exposed to sarcob2 and they are protected and the same with vaccines experimental vaccines in animal models in which they give them the vaccine and they seem to be protected for to the wrist challenge with the virus with live virus again so i don't think we can tell for sure how long that immunity is going to last and we'll learn soon great thank you dr sosa i'm going to move on to a couple of things about symptom and symptom management or um there's a question about is there any information on daily aspirin use and covet inflammatory response right no i haven't seen any any publications specifically of aspirin and this question have sort of a twofold um reason behind it and is is the fact that we know for for once that patients with uh with kobe 19 have developed uh traumatic events there's reports although you know now there's a little bit of controversy how frequent it is but at least there have been case reports and short series of both uh dbts or the venus thrombosis pulmonary embolism and even um arterial thrombotics obstructions or strokes and also micro trombi like hyaline uh thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature so it's it's clear from the from the from the data published that there is a hypercoagulable state so so it makes sense to to think of of drugs that can decrease um coagulation like aspirin like some of the direct oral anticoagulants but i haven't seen a clear recommendation of using either in in patients as a prophylaxis or prevention or or the the aspect of using aspirin as an anti-inflammatory to prevent a complication i haven't seen anything published specifically about that or or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as protective i haven't seen anything along those lines great thank you and there's another pre-registration question about the um asking if you could explain what the the loss of smell with covid what that what that why that happens yeah i've seen a couple of publications apparently there's invasion or or or um they have been able to find in some of the autopsy series they have been able to find viruses and inflammation in the old fathori mucosa um so there is some evidence at least that there is uh the presence of the virus in the in the olfactory and as you know this the smell and the taste are somewhat connected uh so if you affect the the offertory cells and you lose your sense of smell does the taste is also significantly decreased i think um it has to do with that and it's not due to like nasal congestion because you can have hyposmia or an osmium with like common cold if you're really congested you you you can lose your sense of smell due to the general inflammation and congestion but this seems to be a more specific invasion of the cells in the in the in the respiratory tract in the in the open respiratory tract thank you nestor and do you have any can you give any update on the use of monoclonal antibody yeah i haven't seen anything i've seen a couple of reports of laboratories being able to isolate you know very active highly neutralizing antibodies and they usually give them a number they still don't have a name uh and i've seen at least two or three publications uh announcing that they have been able to isolate uh or produce monoclonal antibodies but i haven't seen any clinical data of the of you know actual success with the administration of monoclonal antibodies i think we will soon because there are clinical trials ongoing with some of these uh candidate monoclonal antibodies and they're going to be used uh in the future as we did with ebola that was one of the the earliest therapy for ebola was a monoclonal antibody but i haven't seen anything really uh specifically but i know they are out there and people have been able to obtain these highly active neutralizing antibodies thank you nestor and um i think you mentioned this maybe last week but can you talk a little bit about the data that's coming out about blood groups and their impact on um yeah yeah that's that's a great question i i and actually the the chinese really early i remember this was probably late march uh published um a retrospective review of their patients and they actually saw that the type a was overrepresented um in the kobit patients they have you know they know that the usual uh distribution of frequencies of different blood types in the chinese population and they realize early on that for some reason there were more a's type a hospitalized with kobe than in the general population that was the first clue and then more recently there has been this publication in new england journal in which they actually did genome-wide associations and they found two loci two areas um and some specific polymorphism that are associated with a higher risk one is in chromosome 3 in which they found a transporter protein associated with the receptor with the h2 receptor that was associated with a more severe course and also the type a blood type that also seems to be uh or seems to have a higher uh proportion of severe cases so those are are the two associations epidemiologically we have seen associations with uh with certain ethnicity but we really don't know if it's more related to the social uh determinants of health or something genetic about those ethnicities like like african-american or or hispanic that have been hard hit in some of the areas in new york city and other and other places here in the u.s thank you nestor and there were a bunch of questions in the pre-registration about the about um antibody testing and i know we've been talking a lot about this but if you can just give us your most you know your update and how you how you would use antibody testing at this point right i think the more uh i mean we we know that first of all antibodies takes a few days to to to be uh present in the blood so so probably for for like acute infection they don't have uh enough sensitivity and and it's probably um better to use either an antigen test which is one of the the newer tests that are coming down in the market or the traditional pcr which we have been using uh essentially since this epidemic started the detection of nucleic acid but there's some place for for antibodies and i i showed the graph by the by the cdc in which they actually run antibodies in public population to to get an idea of of the prevalence of the disease so that's one indication to see uh you know how frequent and as you as you saw in the in the slide that i showed i mean what we detected was probably 10 times lower than the number of people that actually were infected and have antibodies against the virus in some of these cities uh so that's one indication to do prevalent studies the other indication would be to select patients that have history of kobe 19 and you want to use it as a potential donor for plasma that's another another uh situation in which in which antibodies have been applicated and if you use a good platform that has a good sensitivity and a specificity you can actually detect people who have a new response and are for instance a good good candidate so for example a good candidate for for plasma and then there are some clinical cases in which if you have a patient relatively early in the disease they have a negative pcr where you have a high clinical suspicion you may use an antibody test uh to detect the production of antibody if they have lost their positivity in the pcr so there are some situations in the clinic in the acute setting in which you can use it uh but after using the pcr as an initial test those i think are the most uh useful situation in which you can use uh serology in general thank you nestor um i'm gene i dr marciniak i'm not gonna um i don't wanna i don't wanna lean on you too much but there was one other question it was actually left over from last week um about and i think it was it was because marla sivers had mentioned that anybody who's in contact with someone for three minutes significant that that was considered significant and so there was a question about that as how that how big the department of health actually came up with that particular time period for to uh to determine a contact can you speak to that um no i i you know i assume that it's it's based on you know cdc guidance i i'm not sure how they came up because each disease that we deal with besides covet has different definitions for what is considered a close contact great thank you thank you very much i'm joanna back to you okay um i'm gonna look at some uh new new chat questions um and and these i think were from perhaps last last week though but we didn't we did not get to them um and um just talking about the um coagulation abnormalities um regarding um dic and is that common enough that preventative uh measures are practical in someone who might be tested collect positive um we've mentioned you've mentioned a lot nestor about putting patients on perhaps aspirin or aspirin like products kind of prophylactically and what is kind of the going thinking right now clinically right uh yeah most of the protocols and this is obviously there hasn't been a like a controlled trial of anti-population against no anticoagulation with hobie 19. but we know first that patients in hospitals patients that are hospitalized for any reason they have an increased risk of dbt in general patients with acute infection and we know this from from many years of of seeing patients with other infection pneumonia bacteremia because of the inflammation because of the inflammatory reaction they do have an increased risk of dbt and pe and this risk it's not only during the hospitalization but actually in some of the studies have been able to prove that an increased risk of of thrombosis even after discharge or up to 30 days after discharged patient with pneumonia for example have an increased risk of having dvt and that has to do with the inflammation with the immobility and many other factors that contribute to the increase so with kobe 19 it's not it's not the exception and in fact there is evidence of of uh at least histopathologic evidence of of dbts pe and as i said microthrombi so it makes sense and a lot of hospitals a lot of health systems are including a prophylactic anticoagulation with either heparin or low molecular weight heparin when the patients are admitted to the hospital and in some cases where the risk is very high patient who has a history of previous dvt or they have already had a pe or a dvt in the hospital they are discharged with uh with some type of anticoagulation you know some of the treatment that i have seen are the use of actual um direct oral anticoagulants like uh pig savan and some of the other um you know direct uh anticoagulants so prophylactically i haven't seen anything and i i would like to point out i haven't seen any study that that recommends the use of aspirin or direct oral anticoagulants before you are hospitalized or you're at home recovering from kobe 19. so that that's important to clarify it may it may be something that we'll do in the future but at this point the risk it's mostly for the patients who are hospitalized and the treatment and anticoagulation is for those who are hospitalized or that are discharged after having copied in the hospital especially if they were in the icu very helpful uh nestor thank you very helpful i i still think eventually we're going to do an observational kind of natural study and look at patients who have been on aspen versus those who haven't um i wonder if dan dan saltman might be able to unmute and ask his interesting question for us about pool testing are you available uh uh yes yes thank you great uh thank you dr sosa for every week uh coming up with all of the good stuff so uh i was just wondering about what the what the public health experience has been with pooled testing and if people are using that it was an interesting strategy they've talked about here in in honolulu and uh i'm not sure how much it's happening but i was wondering the sort of the practical aspects and whether it's a good idea and and whether it uh it's uh how that how that really works in practice too because you have you do have to swab everybody i think to collect the pooled testing and then swab them again if anybody comes up positive so i was wondering about what you think of that right yeah that's a great question i think it's something that that has to be considered i i i have seen some publications of the utility of spool testing and just to to explain the way they is used um is that you you're right the patients are swap but then you sort of combine the the the fluid that that you are you know you take the swap and then you put it in a liquid media and then you to take an aliquot from from each of this patient and mix them together and you can do five or ten and then run a pcr on those uh on that conglomerate of of samples let's say you use ten and then if if you have a negative testosterone if there's no pcr in in in in that sample which contains 10 uh patients you can say okay they are not infected and you move on to the next stem and that that actually save resources if you have a positive signal if if in that pool of tests you have a positive signal then you need to de-aggregate so you go back to the original swap or your original uh fluid taken from the swap and then you test every one of those so that what what that helps you is that you can actually test a larger number of patients in in shorter time and using less reagents and i can save reagents can save money and can save time but you have to have a protocol to obviously look for the individual testing um one situation in which you can use it when you have to use when you have to test a lot of people with a low risk if you if your testing as asymptomatic uh persons uh let's say athletes in the university uh that will have where there have been no uh outbreak you can consider that testing and then you only de-aggregate when you have a positive signal so that's the rationale behind that and it's something similar to the wastewater uh to actually testing um you know they do it city-wide or neighborhood-wide if you can test the wastewater from from from uh from a community you can also detect circulation or not of the virus in certain in certain days and that also can help you see what the activity of the virus in a in a community is as opposed to doing individual testing you can sort of um get a more community a sense of what's circulating in the community obviously both techniques both the pooling and the wastewater have their own complications their own limitations so so it has to be done by by people who know what they're doing and this for for instance the wastewater has been used for polio in the past for rora virus to detect circulation of certain viruses in in communities so it had been used in the past and and can be used in kobe 19. thank you nestor oh go ahead joanna did you have a question oh sure um uh carla i'm not sure if um or maybe uh dr marciniak might be able to answer this question about strategies for containing outbreaks and detention facilities i'm not sure if uh you you might want to take that one dr riciniak okay yeah yeah i was gonna follow up on the other question i mean to my knowledge we're not doing any pool testing okay or other facilities oh am i muted or no we can hear you we're gonna hear you great thanks thank you yeah no i'm not aware of any pool testing in department of health right now uh i mean in the places where we have large outbreaks it's pretty much a shotgun approach where you know all the uh you know pretty much almost everybody was tested um in detention facilities that are that do not have large numbers of cases or any cases i mean there is a focus on you know i i believe the the one strategy with they're using is to you know they do sort of surveillance testing testing the employees and then they they test a lot of the new detainees as they come in and get transferred in from other areas and symptomatic focusing on symptomatic detainees i mean they quote you know that in areas where they're able to do it they do cohort that you know the positive cases and separate them out where the you know the people with the covet cases and the attention facilities are separated from the the non you know non-infected persons um i think there is a strategy for trying to identify high-risk detainees but in some in some estimates it's as high as 40 percent of detainees have some risk and i think a lot of the risk is chronic hepatitis c and possibly cirrhosis related to that but just the typical things like diabetes and obesity also um so so those are just some of the strategies oh sorry i would just go ahead and go ahead carla please yeah and and i know in the correct in the state corrections department that every um person entering and every inmate entering gets tested and then they're quarantined for 14 days um and if if they have no symptoms and they're sent you know they can be sent to where they're going but um and then yeah so everybody's getting tested on entry at this point um just wanted to this is joanna here again want to let everybody know that the cme uh survey did get posted at 12 44 in the chat um another question nestor came in um and from fred fox he says we have used rapid serology testing selectively in case contact investigation when obtaining timely pcrs problematic and using positive results to quarantine and then evaluating the next order of contacts several of these serology positive have been confirmed by pcr and thus the rapid testing was useful in limiting the spread um so didn't know if you wanted to comment on that nester yeah the only the only comment and this is just a theoretical from the from the performance of the test um the the study that have evaluated the positivity of igg and igm um they they start to go up a few days into the disease but they actually peak uh after the second or third week so if you test somebody who has been just exposed let's say three or four days ago and they have a negative test it's very hard to rule out infection that early without serology because they may be you know about to produce the antibodies but if you cast them there early enough they may they may be negative and it's not really that they're not infected it's just that they haven't really uh become positive and you can see in in some of the papers that from china and from italy and here in the united states that actually graph the the positivity of the igg you can see that yeah it starts really early but really peaks after a couple of weeks of disease so you may miss it in the first week if you do if you use just serology even if it's a rapid test you may miss it but of course if you if if you cannot use a pcr it's better than probably doing nothing but it it has that limitation that early on it may be negative because of of the fact that the patient has not produced the antibodies yet back to you carla thank you mr um there's a question about uh reinfection um nancy and i'm not sure if you're how you pronounce your last name it's dich if you can you unmute yourself and ask your question ty can you hear me yeah go ahead thank you i was just curious as like you know practicing and like um when you're talking to other patients and stuff if they do get re-infected if we're worried about this in the past do people follow the same course of illness that they had before like let's say you've had mild symptoms then you can then assume that you'll only have mild symptoms if you have a reinfection or does it get worse or if there's any studies on that yeah that's that's a great great question i think we don't we don't have the answer yet um there was i and some some of the audience may remember uh the cdc of korea actually reported and a patient who had copied they were well documented copied and then weeks or days after the initial episode they again had a positive testing for kovit and i think we we don't know for sure if these patients were just intermittently excreting portions of the virus or they were actually reinfected i think the if if i have to you know pull the experts that i have seen and the papers there's probably no clear evidence of reinfection so far i mean and we're really early in in the in discovery history maybe you know six months down the road a year down the road we'll see a patient who have coffee can have it again we don't know if it's going to be less severe more severe we we have no i haven't seen any publication uh of a clear you know risk of what is the risk of reinfection and what is the clinical manifest of a reinfection uh if it occurs so i think we need to wait um i haven't really uh see any anything that convinced me that there is reinfection at least in the short run and if that reinfection it occurs what what's uh what's the reality what they did in korea is they tried to detect on those late uh relapses let's let's call them relapses or or or excreted late excretor they couldn't culture the virus so there was no viable virus in their throat or in their noses they were actually just pieces of rna that was detected by the pcr but actually not apparently not full infectious virus nor did they saw secondary cases in their in their homes so so it seems like it's really not a reinfection but actually just a persistence of the excretion of the virus so i think we need to wait uh wait for the first wave to go away and see either in the second wave in an area like china or korea we actually get people who already had it to see if they have it again or not or they are protected we don't know yet and we hope not we hope that that either natural immunity or vaccine-induced immunity is somewhat protected so so we have to see you know what what the reality of that or what the end of the story is going to be for for the reinfection great thank you so much nestor um there's a question that came in on the pre-registration of a hydroxychloroquine and i don't know if you can just talk about whether or not hydroxychloroquine is still being looked at for any purpose related to copen19 at this point right i don't know if they have stopped all the trials i mean at some point there were many trials in clinical trials of gov and in the world organization uh registry of trials there were several tribes with hydroxychloroquine in combination with other drugs including acitromycin lopina beer and december etc i honestly don't know if they have all been halted i know that the fda actually uh withdraw the emergency use authorization and a lot of the researchers that i have talked to they're actually not using it anymore or eliminating from their from their protocols because of the association with uh with death basically with with cardiac uh arrest and with some concern about the qt prolongation and possibility of of lethal arrhythmias maybe i i mean i'm speculating here maybe some of the tracks that are ongoing we're not stopped especially if they're combination they may have continued to use it but i don't really know if they're they're still using it in some we are not in in university make sure we are not using hydroxyl group and we use it for for a short while at the beginning of the epidemic uh but we stopped using and we're we're trending more towards rendezvous um convalescent plasma toscilissumab and other newer interventions than hydroxychloroquine thanks nestor and i know maybe you mentioned it but there definitely was this um interest in it being a prophylactic for healthcare workers who were exposed and i know that unm was going to be involved in a study but i don't think that that's moving forward is that correct yes i i think not and there's one publication that wants one prophylactic study published in the new england journal in which it showed no benefit it was given to people with high risk exposure like 88 were considered high-risk exposure and they compared hydroxychloroquine prophylactic with no prophylaxis and and there was a slight numerical uh advantage towards hydroxyl chloroquine but it was not statistically significant so the conclusion of the authors was that in that study hydroxycoroquin did not protect against infection great thank you um for the last question i actually want to see if um nancy brooker she had a clarifying question about her question about um isolation so nancy can you unmute yourself and ask your question if not i can do it for you but i wanted to give you the opportunity no um maybe not so nestor she asked she had a clarifying question she said regarding isolation our hospitals asking patients being discharged to self-isolate an additional 14 days after discharge regardless of when they obtain the 10 days plus 3 of a febrile and improved symptoms is this necessary she says gee i don't think it's necessary i think it goes beyond the usual recommendations and most of the study that i have seen viral excretion goes really way down after day seven and definitely after day 15 uh it's very hard to culture virus or to get a positive you know transmissible virus in a person's secretion so if you were sick in the hospital for a week and then or 10 days and then having another 14 days doesn't make sense to me but i would i would say i have to check the you know if the cc have changed the recommendation one more time but it seemed like a long time for me i think uh in total 14 days makes sense for more than 14 days plus whatever the patients spend in the hospital sounds like a lot especially they have been asymptomatic for you know for a couple of weeks it doesn't make sense to to continue the the base on the data of viral expression yeah no i think that that for my recent reading of the cdc guidelines that's way beyond the recommendation from the cdc it sounds like they're trying to be extra careful in that hospital um so we just have a couple of minutes left there was in the chat somebody asked about the spanish um language echo for coven 19 that we just started and um we we did put a link to where you can find out more information about that in the chat but it is happening now every monday at nine o'clock in the uh mountain time so um dr sosa leads that with other experts from from around latin america so if you speak spanish you might be interested in that one as well and i wanted to make it just finish up with a couple of announcements we will have no office hours next monday the monday right after the holiday weekend so our next session will be on july july 13th from 12 to 1. and if you were unable to get your question answered today please um submit them for the next office hours in a couple of weeks and we'd be happy to answer them again the cme link is in the chat um and any and again just visit our website for any more information about uh upcoming coven 19 sessions joanna go ahead and i just yeah the other covet sessions are the first responder echo which is today at two o'clock mountain time and the critical care echo on thursdays at um from eight to nine mountain time that's all i have carla great thank you nestor any lost uh comments no just thanking everybody for joining we always have this beautiful group of people here asking questions and making me read all weekend long but i really enjoy it and hope to see you in in two mondays thank you very good all right thanks everyone for joining thank you thank you everybody safe safe and happy july 4th you,,6/29/2020
11,welcome to the coven 19 infectious diseases office hours we're really happy to see everybody today um i will just have a couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started as you guys are getting tired of me asking but i oh we always like to see everybody on camera so if you have a camera we would love to uh to see your faces during the um during the session we would ask that you remain muted unless you're called on by somebody on the hub team um and we would like if you have questions during the during the session please put them into the chat box and we would ask that others refrain from answering those directly and those are really directed at the hub and so we'll be we'll be asking those questions to the hub team members um and our digital librarian will be putting things into the chat constantly so please pay attention to that there's really great information going into that and i just want to introduce myself i'm carla thornton infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i want my uh colleague joanna please can you introduce yourself sure hi everybody joanna katzman here welcome thank you joanna and um next i'll just go to nestor sosa if you can just introduce yourself and i know you have some slides that you want to share a brief presentation and then we'll go into the questions yes hi um my name is international source i'm an infectious disease division chief here at unm want me to start sharing the slides yeah okay today i'm going to give you an update uh because we skipped one week i have a slightly longer presentation because it was really amazing the number of new studies and changes and things that have come out in just two weeks it's really the pace of this kobe issue it's really amazing um and i'm gonna you know talk about a couple of papers and articles first starting with um with the transmission and epidemiology um you know i don't know if you heard but in the in the press in the late press there was an announcement that a group of uh over 200 scientists were going to write an uh a letter to the to the wa show um pointing out the importance of airborne transmission in kobe 19 and and actually the the this letter came out in clinical infectious disease in one of the most important journals in in uh in a sort of a pre-preliminary uh pre-publication form but it's going to be published in cid or soon um and and what they they argue i mean they look at the data and and the publication that that especially in from some of the super spreader events and they have uh sort of pointed out that it's important especially now that the economy is open or open in everywhere to try to to also consider the possibility of of transmission uh through through air and in in distances which are longer than the traditional one or two meters that both blow your eyes show and cdc have been advocating and and in fact they they they put us recommendations in in this open letter which is not a research trial or or experiment it's just an opinion piece um to to make sure that in especially in indoor settings they have sufficient and effective ventilation especially in public buildings work environments schools and hospitals and also um to pay attention to the to the ventilation to the the way the the movement of heirs in this close uh spaces and that applies to restaurants uh schools etc and even considering things like like uh ultraviolet light and other and other means to reduce the the number of potential virus that may be in the air and they based their their conclusion in a couple of of studies done before coping but one of the probably the most uh striking paper that they cite is the paper by lee from china and this is the i think we have discussed this this is an outbreak in a restaurant and what you see in here is actually sort of an outline of the tables in that restaurant this is what occurred when they were celebrating the the new year in china and this restaurant was basically full of people and then in table and table a there was a person which is here a1 which was the index case and that person um according to this investigation actually infected all the other red circles all the other individuals that were in the tables b and c and if you see and the explanation is that in this area of the restaurant there was actually like a closed loop of air circulation they had the air conditioning blowing air um and actually because the air conditioning also takes some of the air from from the from the environment there was sort of a closed circuit there and there was no no open windows that there were glass uh walls and and screens but no no open ventilation and that's the hypothesis that um that people that were not sitting at the table and were actually more than two meters away um actually literally six meters away were infected in this in this in this restaurant so so for that reason these authors um you know sort of called the attention of the of wa pro and other organizations to improve ventilation and they they put this illustration in there in the letter and they said that in in cases like this in a closed environment where you have a limited uh number of error change an effort should be done to increase the number of air exchange and you can see the arrows on the roof of this room um bigger and also if possible open the windows so there's like air circulation or um and in that way decrease the concentration of fire that may be um transmissible and maybe floating in the air in distances longer than two meters so that that was basically but that that letter actually made a lot of noise in the in the late press and i wanted to share with you the details the other the other issue that has really uh been brought up to the attention i think we're getting a better idea about this asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission and also you know how different are the asymptomatic people in their immune response to symptomatic people and there were a couple of articles worth mentioning this one was published in nature medicine and it's it's about it's a study done in china in in in the they actually study in the 37 asymptomatic patients and 37 symptomatic individuals and in china they um when they did the contract tracing they actually hospitalized people who were positive and and even if they have no symptoms they were observed for 14 days in hospital set off right for isolation so they had the opportunity of drawing bloods and and doing uh pcrs on these people almost every day so they they were able to document some of the difference between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic individuals would call it 19 and these were all patients that had positive pcr and one of the findings of this story was that viral shedding seemed to be slightly longer and this was a statistically significant difference longer in asymptomatic individuals so in this study was 19 days versus 14 days approximately the mean duration of viral shedding they also found and this has been corroborated by other investigators that the levels of igg uh in in patients with with mild disease or asymptomatic patients was also lower than symptomatic or really critically ill uh subjects so so there seems to be some differences at least in the in the in the degree or amount of immune response in this asymptomatic and in fact something that it's it's probably um significant and of significant concern is that the antibodies tend to decrease um relatively earlier than we thought and then this is probably these are another paper i'm going to mention is probably one of the first evidence uh solid evidence that in fact there is some uh waning or or diminution of the of the antibody levels in patients who are um who have had either symptomatic or asymptomatic disease and in fact they one of the main conclusion of this paper is the 40 of the asymptomatic individual 40 and almost 13 of symptomatic patients became sero-negative after eight weeks so only two months and they already [Music] had negative antibody testing after being positive initially in the disease so that tells you and that the first issue that came to my mind is that these serological stories that we have been doing uh may underestimate the number of people that have been infected because if you test people really after eight weeks of their acute illness they may have already lost the the antibodies and this this is the the same result graphically so in the acute phase which is the top part of the graphic um you can see 80 percent of the asymptomatic 83.8 percent develop igg but then when you see the convalescent phase which in this case is eight weeks later forty percent um lost the the zero positivity in the asymptomatics or a higher percentage of people asymptomatic basically lose their antibodies and and twelve point nine in this in the arm of the cinematic so this is still a small study it's only 37 patients but it was well well conducted and i think it's worth noting um that diminution and in fact last night when i was reviewing these slides and and looking at at the pre-publication um repository i found this this paper just from from basically presented uh yesterday in the in the literature or in the in the pre pre-publication literature and it was a study out of england in which they also documented uh the longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody response in sars coefficient this graph illustrates the level of neutralizing antibodies measured by the iv50 in 65 individuals and you can see that the the the mean which is the line the blue line the the antibodies go up and then by day 75 to 100 starting to go back to baseline so they lose their neutralizing antibodies after probably two to three months so this is this is something that is obviously um of concern and this is something that that we in some ways uh commented that it was possible because we know this is something that happens with other coronavirus including sarge one and some of the endemic coronaviruses so interesting the good part of the story i i didn't want to leave you with with the with the bad news but really the good news is that we are finding more evidence of a robust t-cell immunity as you as you remember the immune system has two type of uh responsibility the humor humeral or antibody response and the t cell um or or or cellular mediated immune response and there is evidence at least from from a couple of papers that are coming out that that people who have infection even asymptomatic or mild covey 19 induces uh t-cell immunity and diesel immunity because in both t memory t cells tend to be long-lasting probably longer than than the antibodies and and basically that's that's the conclusion of of this this this paper in which they they actually in the one sentence summary they said sars kobe 2 induces robust memory t cell responses in even in antibodies or negative and antibodies sense are positive individual so so even if you have you have no antibodies there seem to be an immune response and some some really curious finding of this paper is that they found um memory t-cell responses even in exposed family members that had no infection so so maybe there's there's uh i mean there's more to this story um but it was interesting to see that that the family members that were not not even asymptomatic they were family members not infected that they didn't have any pcd positive pcr but that but their t cells apparently were reacting to the to the antigens of of of stars kobe 2 so it's interesting so so i think that the the take home message for me it's it's that probably when we measure uh cerro prevalence we we're going to have to take into consideration first the fact that the antibodies may go down with time and we we need to consider t-cell response and measure in some way in order to really assess what percentage of the population has been infected uh retrospectively obviously there are still uh many questions you know our memory t-cell responses protective presumably yes there's evidence from from sarge one that patients with with um with t-cell responses were were uh immune and also even uh animal models that used t-cell responses they were protected from a re-challenge from from sars copy one but it's important to study these and how durable these these are responses theoretically they're very long-lasting uh we know that from from many other uh infections uh like tv that if you if somebody has been exposed to tuberculosis and you take their t cells and expose them to the antigen they're going to produce interference and that's the base for the quantiferon test that we do in the lab for to detect uh asymptomatic infection with tuberculosis or or or previous exposure to tuberculosis um another question is even if neutralizing antibodies or or human immunity decreases um you know it probably decreases from a laboratory standpoint but do we get an amnestic response if we get exposed again that we don't know and and obviously the obvious question is that if we're going to vaccinate it probably has to elicit both humeral and t-cell responses because maybe the the antibodies are going to decrease as we saw with some of these stories so interesting stuff the other the other uh significant um point about the asymptomatic is that really we have come to appreciate how important is asymptomatic transmission um i think over the weekend the cdc uh commented that up to 40 percent of the of the patients um could have an asymptomatic infection so this study that i'm showing here is basically it's a modeling study uh some modelers actually um assume two situations uh assume that 17.9 of the infections were as asymptomatic in one scenario and the other scenario 30.8 asymptomatic infection and they actually measure what would be the effect of just identifying those symptomatic basically ignoring not not isolating asymptomatic individuals so going for instance just testing people who have symptoms not really asymptomatic and they found that really if we do that there's no way to decrease the attack rate of the disease we would need to really search for the for the asymptomatic because in in their calculation 47 of the transmission is actually pre-symptomatic 3.4 asymptomatic uh in data scenario one and in the other scenario with a 30 percentage of of asymptomatic infections uh 47 would be pre-symptomatic and 6.6 so significant almost or more than 50 percent of the transmission was my patient had no symptoms so it's important to to look for those and they actually constructed sort of a curve in order to decrease the attack rate below one percent and this is the blue line on the bottom you you actually have to make an effort to identify at least 40 to 45 percent of asymptomatic individuals so so we need to do you know good contact tracing and and consider testing even asymptomatic patients in in the algorithm that's the take-home message of these of these um story regarding new drugs there's a couple of of worthwhile uh publications there there is an uh interlooking one receptor antagonist called anakinra which is uh it's a drug that is used by the rheumatologist to treat uh um rheumatoid arthritis uh it's sort of a second line drug um but it's been used clinically for for some years and this this investigator actually did a retrospective study in which they they um resurrected analysis in which they they gave anakinra to 52 patients with kobi and they compared with 44 relatively well matched historical control from the same institution and they found that the the rate of admissions to icu and death was 25 in the treated um subjects as opposed to 73 in those who did not receive an akinra and were treated in presumably very close in time and in the same institution and this finding was obviously this difference was a statistically significant the only caveat that i saw of this story besides the fact that it's a retrospective study um is the fact that there was more people with hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin in the in the anakinra um group and and obviously this is not a randomized trial as i said so so but it's interesting to see that another anti-inflammatory we have already seen um intermediate quality studies with tossily sumac showing decreasing in in icu admission so this is another another potential drug that requires really randomized prospective trials and these are the graph illustrating the difference between in between the historical group in blue and the ana anakinra in in red and you can see that obviously the curves are pretty separated um and also the the the graph in the bottom is the crp the c reactive protein levels and they really go down in the industry here with uganda kindred the other story that that somewhat throws some confusion into the hydroxychloroquine uh story was this retrospective story from uh published in the international journal of infectious disease this um this is a study was out of detroit of the henry ford health system in detroit and they actually uh did a retrospective look into patients that had received hydroxychloroquine acetomycin alone or hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin and um they found in this retrospective study that those who receive hydroxychloroquine had a lower mortality you can see the percentage um their mortality overall was 18 in the group those treated with hydroxychloroquine were 13.5 those with none of the drugs that did not receive hydroxychloroquine or acetomycin had a 26 and this was a statistically significant decreasing in the mortality and they they look at both direct mortality and they also did a multivariate cause cox regression and they found that both patients with hydroxychloroquine hydrocephtropine and acetomycin had decreased mortality and this is the graph basically the red and blue are the hydroxychloroquine containing regimens um and then i'm sorry the red and blue are the the no hydrochloroquine containing regimens so the the survival was less than those who had hydroxychloroquine in the combination but there was a big big issue with this trial and i think it's uh now in in in light of the recovery strike from from the uk um i really question the results of this trial if you see the line given steroids that i have i have highlighted in red you can see that in the hydroxychloroquine um and hydroxychloroquine with acetomycin up to 70 more than 70 percent of the patient receive corticosteroids as opposed to much lower percentage in the in the neither of the drug or acetomycin along 35 and 38 so i'm wondering if this effect this mortality effect is uh compounded by the by the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids and not really um achievable to hydroxychloroquine so so i think the i think the overall story or conclusion is that we still don't know we need more um perspective randomized trial to see if earlier use of hydroxychloroquine does anything the good thing about this study is that they didn't see an increase in mortality nor did they see arrhythmias which were detected in the in the ba and a couple of the of the new york retrospective studies and the final topic that i want to mention i'm sorry i've taken such a long time i apologize to carla and andre but i just want to you know keep people um uh concentrating in this issue also the excess um death with the word was reported by cdc um and you can see how there is a clear correlation in excess death associated with with kobe 19 and age and there was also a publication in jama but i'll show you first this and and not only and the excess number of death in this period of of uh of the epidemic is not only due to covet but to other to other diseases so we have to you know pay attention to to the the fact that the people are dying of other diseases and in fact um in in jama they just published this paper from several uh states in here in the united states and you can see a spike in the death due to heart disease diabetes cerebral vascular disease and alzheimer's and they are not direct not necessarily directly related to coffee they they are probably related to the fact that patients were postponing their treatment or or losing their medications or not not being able to get refills because of the you know the hospital situations in many of these of these places so it's it's uh you know sort of discouraging to see that people are not only dying of kobe but also dying of other diseases because they don't get um on time health care i think that was my last yes that's one of my last and we can go to the question thank you thank you nestor for that really excellent update um we also have um marla sivers here from our new mexico department of health we're really happy to have her today so i asked her if she would just introduce herself and just give us a little update from the public health side hi thank you carla marla sivers i'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the new mexico department of health and i think i'll just point out uh briefly today that there is a rollback of some of our opening measures that goes into place today you probably are all aware of that but based upon the number of new cases continuing to rise in new mexico over the last several weeks um and if anyone is watching the daily press reports we've had several days recently with over 300 new cases identified some of the reopening has been rolled back so there is no more indoor dining allowed starting today outdoor dining capacity is being further curtailed and some strengthening of the universal masking directive from the governor's office and nestor thank you for reviewing those studies regarding waning immunity obviously this has potential big impacts um for everyone as we move forward about what reopening might look like and particularly i know people are very concerned about reopening of schools so i think we'll have more information coming on that later in the week thank you marla great so think we got a bunch of pre-registration questions and a lot of great questions in the chat so i'm going to turn it over to joanna to start the questions great uh again thank you nestor uh fantastic presentation so so valuable we really appreciate giving the week off we know there's just so much the news coming in about kovitz so much journal articles and thanks marla too for giving us that update carla yes i'll start with some kind of just-in-time chat questions the first is from uh leslie hayes um leslie says does waning antibody levels necessarily imply no immunity or will people still be able to mount an immune response quicker than people who are not infected that's from uh dr hayes nester right yeah good question i think if we extrapolate what we know from other infectious diseases that there are instances in which you have an infection and your immunity goes down but if you re-challenge with the with uh with the bacteria or the virus there's sort of an amnestic response or a memory response of the immune system and that's the idea of having like a tetanus shot every 10 years or so that you you know that your immune system remembers but you just need like a boost so the the hope is that even if we have this uh laboratory detectable decreases in antibody the immune system remembers that antigen that spike protein and once you're exposed there's like a rapid you know besides that innate immunity there's some adaptive immunity that will come up to come out to the rescue uh in the second time around and and and although they have been recently they have been i've seen in the in the in the you know in the late press uh doctors even physicians saying that they have seen a few patients with a second infection it's something that it's it's uh it's something that's been reported uh to this point after 12 million people infected in the world i haven't seen a publication certifying um that they are there are um you know second second infection so there's there's got to be some immunity because a lot of people have experienced kobe they are still in areas where there's called circulation month after that and and we haven't really seen a publication of clear-cut well-documented second infections so so there's got to be an immunity that's a really really interesting esther um lynne colemeyer i think asks a very similar question dr colemeyer to dr hayes and i think that you've answered it uh so i i'll i'll pass on that everyone can read dr culmer's question but i think it was uh you you kind of answered that perfectly uh dr unrzad asks a question has anyone looked at the role of masks in airborne transmission similar to the restaurant study uh nestor could you can you respond to that yeah there have been a couple of of instances especially with the choir uh episode and a couple of other situations in which they have been documented er airborne at least no document suspected i should i should use the words carefully suspected airborne transmission because there hasn't been and some of these people even had some social distancing measures some partial measures and despite that there were you know instances of of transmission um i would say longer an instance longer than two meters so there is a there is a concern and i think even even wa show that have been reluctant to to uh accept urban transmission some of the scientists are beginning to to you know to wonder that you know the data is there to to point out it's not the most common way still we know face to face close contact is much more riskier um than than long distance but it's possible if you stay in a closed room with very bad circulation and somebody's coughing and you know throwing some small particles that can float in the air for longer distance it's possible that you you inhale some of those and become infected i think it's it's a good consideration it's probably still not the main source and it has been really really associated with these super spreaders even more than more than anything thank you nestor um dr sebolden in montana um asked can we draw any conclusions from the immune response and immunity after the infection of the sars cov1 and mers coronaviruses in relation to what we may expect from covid19 yeah probably the the most clear conclusion is that even if you lose your antibody if you have a robust uh memory t cell you're probably protected they have been studies in i think animals i saw i think it was rats or some type of rodent in which they did an experiment uh infecting them with sars and they they were able to withstand the re-infection if they had t-cell uh memory responses even without a significant antibody response they were they were protected from a second infection with the t with the t cell uh immunity so so yeah i think uh you know that that that's that should be uh if it's similar with sarcoby2 the the fact that the patient even asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are mounting a robust cell uh it's important even if they lose their antibodies seems to be the the latest uh findings thank you um dr siebel do you wanna unmute and ask your next question about the um humeral response similar to the smallpox outbreaks i'm sure dr sosam i was trying to get a handle on what you're talking about with the uh response and i was wondering we've talked a lot over the years especially in disaster medicine about what we might expect from from those of us who still have the little dimple on our arms from smallpox vaccinations but still have but have no testable antibodies is that the same kind of response that we expect i'm trying to again i'm trying to understand what you've been talking about today is that a similar response to what's theorized with um exposure to variola and previous vaccination even though you have no testable antibodies right i think yeah i i'm not very aware of of the studies specifically with with the with smallpox but i can tell you from just the general in immunology principles um you know if if if you develop if if you have a population of cells of t cells that actually are dismembered so that now we can identify with flow cytometry and specific markers that that are um programmed to to respond to a specific antigen or epitope in the virus they are long-lasting cells they are this this t cell memory cell that can last for years sometimes for the the the whole lifetime of a subject so if you acquire those t cells if those t cells are sensitized to the spy protein or some other critical part of the sars kobe 2 virus uh you even if you don't have measurable antibodies you're probably going to have a an immune response that's that's what the studies have shown with many vaccines and also natural infections uh obviously we would love to have both uh especially iga which is an excretory and preventing infection but if you having cell immunity you're probably protected from severe disease and that's what being seen in monkeys with with these with one of the vaccines that they tried in macaques they they became infected they had viral load in the throat but the disease in the lung was not present they were protected from a severe pulmonary infection by having this combined cellular and and humeral immunity so it's it's interesting i think i think um most of the vaccines manufacturers are looking for vaccines that actually trigger both and that's why they use using adjuvants even if you use just a purified protein purify spike protein from the virus they are combining it with some adjuvants that actually um recruit the the cellular immune response and get the immune response also the cellular immune response to participate because this law is long-lasting thank you thank you dr siebel for asking that in um over the video and thanks nestor i'm wondering if marlow might be able to answer a couple questions if not um that's that's quite all right don't want to put you on the spot marley are you available no oh great um marla there's a couple kind of questions related to uh public health and one is um uh related to any tips for uh the public regarding to desensitizing them about wearing masks do you have any this is from bianca ortega do you have any resources to help with mass desensitization or mass training for patients i haven't seen anything but i i like the idea i mean i think it's really cultural in the united states that we're so resistant to wearing a mask you you know see other parts of the world where they've adopted it uh quite readily and uh continues to be very difficult here in the united states i think there are a lot of people trying to make masks more attractive maybe that will help you know there's a lot of designs and things that are available now i see it all the time um online when i'm trying to read news stories you know you search for covet and then you get a lot of um ads for masks um so i'm kind of hopeful that that will help people um sort of adopt masking if they see it as a an accessory instead of a medical device but i think just consistent messaging um from public health professionals and clinicians about the benefits of masking is probably going to be our best you know best effort at um helping to reduce that resistance thanks marla um just one more quick question um is con this is from narit pot um is contact tracing catching up with the increased numbers of cases in new mexico you know the department of health continues to onboard new people each week who are being hired as contact tracers and people in other positions have been reassigned to contact tracing with the increase in cases you know obviously it's a challenge to keep up and as um things have reopened a bit the number of contacts that each case has has risen um so it's sort of exponential growth um for every confirmed case instead of having you know two or three household contacts which is what we were seeing when everyone was understand home orders you know now people may have a dozen or more contacts so definitely the you know the work is increasing as people are more mobile but we continue to add additional positions as i said every week to try to keep up with that demand marla can i can i ask a question joanna and the the contacts the people are considered really close contacts you you are you testing them or just tell them to stay at home for 14 days what do you do with a with a close contact let's say you identify a person or or persons with a close contact what do you do just remind us i know you we have discussed this but i keep forgetting sure so close contacts are advised to get tested and quarantined so everyone is given quarantine recommendations you know 14 days after their last contact with the case and people are um being directed to test as well and the testing occurs right away or you just you wait x number of days after the contact or you you say the code be tested right away what's what's the strategy in general you know a lot of times um so i would say both um if we're really clear about a case being symptomatic and when a person may have had contact with them we may suggest waiting a few days before testing in many cases um you know the index case is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and it's a little less clear when their illness began and in that case we'll just recommend that people get tested as soon as they can thank you marla i have one more question about contact tracing can you just go over your the doh's definition of close contact again yeah happy too because it's unique um so um currently our definition of close contact is if you've been within six feet of a confirmed case for more than three minutes and neither one of you were masked we're considering that of close contact if one or both were masked it's 10 minutes thank you very much great so um nestor i'm going to go back to you there's a couple of questions that were sent in on the pre-registration about whether or not this virus is me is mutating um can you just talk about that in general yes yeah in general coronaviruses and and rna viruses in general they when they replicate they do not um correct the errors that the polymerase uh introduces so there's like random mutations that are probably meaningless for the virus of the host and there are some mutations in critical portions of the virus that may change the behavior and in fact they have been well documented changes and and people the geneticists can actually uh tell uh which virus have been in europe from the one that is circulating in the u.s from the one circulating in latin america because they know that there are some sort of clusters or clades of viruses that have accumulated a certain amount of mutation with with this mutation there are two key questions number one is do the the infectivity or severity of the disease is modified by the mutation so far there is a mutation it's called g for chords it's g614 a substitution in the spike protein that seems to be uh or seems to be making the virus more infectious because as soon as it's introduced into a population seems to be the predominant variant and that's been circulating in the u.s in latin america and in some countries in europe we haven't really seen more severe cases and in fact because the demographics of the people affected now are changing especially here in the united states with younger uh population being affected that if anything the lethality or mortality is going down but maybe just because it's affecting a different uh population that at the beginning which mostly elderly folks in nursing home etc so so you know that that's that's one of the quick questions the other key question with mutation is is the mutation significant enough to affect the immunogenicity of a vaccine and so far i haven't seen any mutation that changes the spike protein so much that will render a vaccine ineffective so far so so the the changes are there there are mutations there are different clades or subtypes of the virus but but for now it seems to be um you know within the realm of the vaccines that they are developing and not changing the severity of the disease uh maybe changing the infectivity of the virus because the spike protein is is more effective attaching to the receptor that's that's what the scientists are thinking with this g mutation that have been detected in a significant number of of uh strains thank you thank you mister there are quite a few questions also just on the accepted ambulatory treatment for mild cases and just out people outpatient treatment for cases if you can talk about that right i i reviewed recently the the nih uh guidelines for management here in the united states and there's really nothing specific we haven't i mean there's no clear cut indication for any outpatient uh drug like we're not using rendezvous in outpatient we're not anti-coagulating we're not recommending aspirin or heparin on our patient it's basically still uh you know the the health measures the the infection control and prevention measures of isolation etc and and and things that they need to do at home but really no specific treatment aside from symptomatic if they have cough you know they can take cough medication if they have fever they can they can take acetaminophen uh but but there's no clear-cut indication for that there are stories ongoing on convalescent plasma for mild diseases or monoclonal antibodies for mild disease um and even some antivirals that are in earlier development to use it in outpatient but there's nothing like like it's really approved or recommended at this point for for for mild diseases managed at home great thank you nestor and um deborah bear here in albuquerque i don't know if you are you okay i'm muting yourself and asking your question about pregnant patients because i'm not sure i quite understand it if it was it's just how they should be managed as an outpatient or are you available debra yes um how to manage pregnant women outpatient just wonder about increased increased coagulation with estrogen if they should be just unprogested only methods when they're covered positive great thank you and esther also leslie hayes is on i know leslie talk about code pregnancy i'm not sure if she she can answer this but leslie last time i looked which was a week or two ago they are not recommending any specific treatment for pregnant women as an outpatient so thank you leslie and esther did you have anything else no just to remind i think i presented this a couple weeks ago here is that recently because at the beginning there was no apparent severity or difference ability but i think with the experience in the united states pregnant uh patients seems to go they have a higher percentage of icu admissions um and and mechanical ventilation in the population study that have been done compared to non-pregnant females so there is sort of a more complicated course interestingly enough mortality was not higher it was the same mortality 0.2 if i remember correctly 0.2 percent mortality in pregnant and non-pregnant females would call it uh but yeah obviously if you have a a patient a pregnant patient that it's close to the end of the pregnancy and develops kobe you have to be you know extra careful because we know that there's some more uh they are a higher risk of of developing respiratory failure or going into the hospital to the liver or any other obstetric complications so it's sort of a i mean you have to be more careful i think is the the message with the information that we have now thank you nestor and there are several questions about the use of inhaled judassinide can you talk about that yeah i saw i don't know if you're referring i saw um i think it was a texan doctor a comprehensive of yours karla in on tv on one of the you know youtube videos uh in an interview on tv saying that he had discovered the silver bullet for for covet and it was inhaled a steroids i immediately look at the literature and i i couldn't find in the pubmed i couldn't find a study that actually shows uh benefit of inhaled steroids that and i look at clinicaltrials.gov and they are still leaning health terrors i think the bottom line is number one we don't know if it's if it's helpful number two if a patient needs it for for uh for his copd he probably can continue with it and we'll just follow the literature and see if there's any clear-cut advantage of using hail steroids for for copied or for severe copy there's no there's no data except for the opinion of these uh of these physicians great thank you nestor um joanna are you ready do you have a few questions sure sure um thanks nestor um and thanks everybody who's uh asked these great questions and those of you who have unmuted too and asked um yeah there's been a couple of questions um nestor about the relationship between animals and humans and i think what they're meaning is can you know uh if you if you have a dog and you're petting your dog a lot and then you bring friends over but you're socially distancing with those friends and then the dog interacts with your friends you know do you need to be careful about um animals and and humans um to be safe right that's a great question i i don't know the answer i mean i i i haven't seen anything dramatic since we documented that cats were susceptible in the veterinary but i don't follow the veterinary literature to be honest uh so but it's um so i don't know i i really don't know i think that it's in theory it's possible but they haven't demonstrated animal to human i mean domestic animal to human transmission it's been humans to animals like the tiger in the new york or lion in the new york zoo and a couple of domestic cats that have become positive in in the within a family they have kobe 19 circulation but i i haven't seen any comments or literature the other way around like a dog or a cat giving it to the the owner so um i really cannot open beyond that thank you nestor i'm wondering actually if beth deller is on the if beth deller might be able to unmute and ask because i'm not sure if i actually got that her question uh correct or not beth are you available uh maybe not okay let me ask another question um uh we've a lot of another question came like is there any more information nestor that you know of have you seen any more recent literature in the last couple of weeks regarding blood types about three months ago we talked about eight you know the eight you know the a blood group um being kind of more susceptible than the oh and the other blood uh blood types and then more recently you also mentioned that again but if have you have you seen anything in the last couple of weeks any more literature nothing else and i just want to clarify i heard in one of the news outlets um that that people with type o are immune i think that it's not correct that they're immune there's actually less susceptibility to disease but there have been thousands of people with typo that are infected is obviously um there is an association with a higher degree of infection and severity in type a but it's not that other blood types are immune it's not true simply not true but yeah but i haven't seen anything else thank you nestor um might you be able to comment on i know we haven't really finished this first wave but perhaps um might you be able to comment on um will we see even another spike or a continuation of the kova 19 this fall similar to influenza and and what is your thought about that and will influenza make things worse or pop or or perhaps protect it right to be honest i don't know the answer to any of those questions i mean um we have seen the summer and how the virus didn't go away in the summer so that was sort of a surprise to some people um and if we don't do like really uh significant public health measures the in the incidence is not going to go down uh i mean i can i can tell you the example from other countries that they have been conscious in which they have done like genetic studies and they have been able to calculate the number of introductions and i can tell you uh in panama which is my my country um we have been able to do genetic studies documented that at the beginning of the epidemic where eight introduction only eight people would copy enter the country and that had produced uh you know over 30 000 cases in in the country so it's uh so as long as we have transmission in the community uh the the risk for for this infection it's it's there and it's not gonna go away i don't think it's going to decrease significantly unless there's like public health measures um controlling the infection i see happening in europe if you if you see the epidemiological curves in many countries in europe you can see how it goes up very high in italy in spain and then goes completely down to like you know a few hundred cases a day as opposed to to 70 000 or whatever we're having now in the united states but i don't know what's going to happen really in in the fall and the winter and i don't know what the influence of of influenza is going to be over of recovery circulation i have no idea thanks nestor i think it's a i think it's a waiting game in terms of schools and k-12 and pre-k and colleges and everything with this fall um i'm wondering if leslie dr hayes if you might be able to um unmute and talk a little bit about what you sent me in terms of training children to wear masks sure this was just from a pediatrician on a kobit group i'm on online and i'll send it out to everyone but um it was just a google doc and the idea was they said please don't wait until the first day of school to have your children learn how to wear a mask start now have them start at five minutes a day or five minutes three times a day and gradually work up and how to do it so i will send it out to everyone i just thought it was very very useful and i'm going to try and hand it out to my patients so dr hayes it makes a whole lot of sense right i mean with a lot of kids not wearing masks now even though marla can refresh her uh can remind us what are the regulations in terms of at least for new mexico the age you know how you should be wearing a mask with uh what age but you can't just ask a child you know who's five to all of a sudden start wearing a mask for you know six hours a day so thanks leslie so much carla back to you thank you did you want to ask marla did you want to clarify about the age that'd be great yeah so cdc's recommendation is that um anyone under the age of two not wear a mask so children over the age of two um and as long as children are able to um remove the mask themselves you know if they were having difficulty breathing um so that's kind of the guidelines from cdc is that children over the age of two um but to not put a mask on anyone under the age of two or someone you know who would be unable to remove the mask on their own thank you very much and all i know there was a question in the chat by melvin and mccabe about pooled testing pooled testing and you you would win that there is none but can you just talk a little bit about a situation where you one might use pulled pool testing yeah i think there's been a lot of additional discussion about it recently um i think there's you know pluses and minuses i'm not a laboratory expert i don't know if carissa colbreath is on the call today um i think there are concerns around pool testing in terms of um sensitivity is what i've heard and you know if one of those in the pool is positive then testing has to be repeated people are sampled individually so it doesn't address some of the concerns around shortages of things like the appropriate swabs um and test collection kits i you know i think it seems like there is definitely um you know a place for it when you're looking at sort of more population-based testing um versus trying to identify individual cases quickly and do contact tracing and isolation which is sort of still the the phase of the pandemic response in new mexico that we are in right now you know if one of those in the pool tested positive um like i said then an additional test would have to be run so you're still then you're even delaying maybe those test results for individuals a bit longer and and you know losing several hours or a day opportunity to quickly identify and isolate those cases um so i think you know more to come on that it's definitely an interesting approach i just don't know that we're there yet in new mexico in terms of how we're continuing to respond other places with higher case counts may start to lean on pool testing much earlier thank you marla um it looks like um beth can unmute herself now and ask and you can clarify your question that would be great yeah we can okay great yeah so um i i just wanted and the speaker may not know uh this information but you know we're doing a lot of testing we're doing a lot of research about covert how it's transmitted um you know what to do protocol what not but i guess my my my question is more about the source you know how it's being tr you know how it's being transmitted from animals but what are we doing about the research of how to prevent you know animal um contagion to human does that make sense yeah thank you go go ahead nestor yeah i mean there's there have been a few years of this concept of one health in which you actually approach uh human and animal diseases sort of in a single coherent uh um approach and and i think there have been some research but uh one thing that that it's been advocated is just surveillance in animals i mean doing regular surveillance in animals uh to detect this this potentially you know potential virus that can jump into humans the other the other thing is just improving our our you know the interaction in between humans and animals preventing like you know wild game or some type of animals from coming uh to the to the markets especially in the in the east where it's more more common so i think it's it's a complex issue of you know respecting the space of the animals in the natural world regulating the commercial commercialization of these animals and there is also the problem with with uh with people breaking the law basically if if you put a rule that you cannot sell let's say live snakes in a market and then people sell it you know through the back door so it's a very complicated topic but but i think the scientists are aware of these of these risks and and people are trying to to come up with like genomic solutions like monitoring the viruses in in bats and other animals that are potential uh sources of these but it's it's a complicated really complicated um issue these are preventing further jumps and and you know they're we are following now this this new swine uh influenza and they have been the the avian flu before and many many viruses that are secular in animals that they have the potential to jump into human and then even worse to have human to human transmission which is what we really fear the most thank you nestor um just wanted to remind everybody that the cme uh and feedback questions are in the chat as of 12 53 even if you don't need this cme and you have time it's great if you would fill out the feedback for us because it really really does help to inform our our programs um we have about six minutes left so i think i'll go through some more uh questions um dr epstein mark epstein are you available to unmute and ask your question hi this is jane mark's wife hi how are you doing so i'm wondering if there's any evidence that transmission from children to adults is less common than from adults to children okay i'm going to take the first part of the question i mean i i can repeat what i have learned about children in general i mean children seem to be less susceptible to severe disease um they also seem to be less susceptible to infection in general they have been you know studies especially from china and other countries in which they actually look at um intra domiciliary secondary cases and the percentage of kids that have tested positive presumably from from their from their family adults are less than other adults so so they seem to be less susceptible to infection and less susceptible to to disease severity with the exception of this multi-inflammatory syndrome that is a rare phenomenon but it's been described with them i don't think we know enough how well do the children can amplify the infection once they have it if they're positive i haven't seen any clear-cut information regarding their potential transmissibility but just by raw numbers they are less susceptible and and they do not seem to be the driver of this epidemic if we can use a single phrase uh the the drivers are are mostly adults uh people with asymptomatic pre-symptomatic transmission that they don't know they have it and they transmit it but keith seems to play a secondary role so far and this is my my caveat so far thank you nestor i wanted to see if dr hayes might have heard of any different evidence on that as well thanks i have seen the same evidence you have but the one caveat i will make is so far the kids have been socially isolating a lot more than the grown-ups are just because they have not been in school whereas you know a substantial percentage of grown-ups have been at work or other things and so i don't think we fully know the answer yet on whether or not once we get a bunch of them together in school whether or not they will become a vector then and there's no evidence at all that they will but there's also really no evidence that they won't and we're still waiting to see on that one and uh jane i you're you're a you do um maternal fetal you do um family uh don't you do and family practice i i did do adolescence yes okay uh what is your thought on that jane um i read something that was claiming that um children would not be transmitting to adults vis-a-vis opening schools but i was not convinced about the evidence right right i just want to add yeah there have been some comments in in the late press about europe because i mean here in the united states this epidemic coincided with the summer and summer vacation in other places in other parts of the world they have open schools with mixed results i mean there have been reports of outbreaks within schools or or universities elsewhere um and and also you know uh data to the contrary that they have open schools and they haven't seen these these expected outbreaks so i think but with this virus i would rather err on the on the safety side and try to implement as many um you know control measures as possible in the schools because we really don't know and and there's also the teachers and the staff and people who work in the in the in the schools that they are gonna you know be there and and and they they can become infected from the children or from each other in the break rooms in the lunch time et cetera so you know it's something to to think about one of my patients um manages school buses and he made a comment i hadn't thought about it he said they're going to be checking temps before they get like kids on the bus and he said they have no idea what they're going to do if the temp is elevated because he said they can't leave the child at the bus stop but they also really can't let them on the bus and so he said you know it's a hard situation and there's all sorts of details like that that need to be ironed out thanks leslie thanks dr hayes dr sosa thank you marla everybody um just wanted to remind you we've got one minute left that we have a a few other uh cova 19 programs we have one at two o'clock on mondays which is the first responder resiliency program we have our critical care echo still going every week with michelle r harkins and she has different specialists giving presentations and we have with cases every week as well we have in every other wednesday nursing home echo as well and uh we have a regularly scheduled hiv and covet echo um as well we're trying to bring back our covert specialty echo on fridays and we'll keep you posted and we're looking forward again to the infectious disease office hours next monday so stay tuned thank you dr sosa thank you marla thank you dr hayes and most importantly thank you everybody for coming on and spending an hour with us take care you,,7/13/2020
12,buddy can you hear me great okay well welcome welcome everybody to uh the office hours echo the infectious disease echo it's july 20th i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i'm one of the associate directors at project echo and my colleague carla thornton is on too carla do you want to say hi and wave i don't know if you can see carla that we have a lot of folks on today and we're grateful um i just wanted to make a few um a few announcements and i think we're still uh waiting for dr sosa to arrive to but we have a few another oh did you want to hide i'm sorry thank you thank you dr sosa i need to make just a few announcements um it's so great to see everybody all of your faces um and that always reminds me that um if you don't have your video turned on but you have the ability to do so you have a webcam and you're in a kind of a private space if you can please turn on your webcam it's it's so it's a much better teaching opportunity for you and for us for us to see you and you to see us if you can please do that that would be great it's it really fits in with the the echo model and community of practice um also our digital librarian kent noseworthy will be um writing many many typing many many things in our in our chat um you can just copy and paste anything that seems uh interesting to you as is dr sosa or our marla seavers or or leslie hayes or some of her other experts um comment on some evidence guided journal articles or recent news that they have been hearing about finally at about 45 minutes after the hour you will receive cme information even if you don't need the cme but would like to provide feedback please uh do so um we also have a relationship with the cdc and that they have a 24-hour um clinic clinician-on-call a center so if you need any kind of information please go ahead and use them they have also been referring lots of clinicians to our network as well and with that i would like to turn it over to dr sosa we're so happy to see you i know you've been crazy busy on service um with the uptick of of cases uh coffee cases and and non non-cova cases alike so we're so happy to see you truth thank you thank you i know thank you very much so amnesty i'm the infectious disease division chief we've been doing this for several weeks just in case we have new new participants i just want to introduce myself i'm going to share with you a brief presentation on the latest publication that i found really interesting let me see if i can share my my screen here just a second when i open the presentation let me move on to the first slide can you see my okay perfect okay let's go over the update let me just minimize this all right okay so there were a couple of uh interesting articles on on prevention and vaccines that i want to just review with everybody uh first of all i mean not that we really need more evidence of of how universal masking works but there was this interesting research letter published in jama just a few days ago and this is a study that was performed in one of the boston city hospitals i mean one of the boston hospitals during the peak of their their initial uh wave of the epidemic and they actually were positive for kobe before and after they implemented a universal masking in the hospital so it's meaning everybody in the hospital patients all healthcare workers have to use either a procedure or a surgical surgical mask including obviously visitors and patients and i'm just going to show you one graph and this basically summarizes everything in this graph they have the dates that you can see from march 6 to april 29th they have three different um times the time before universal masking which is in in pink in this area and they have sort of a of a transition phase when they implemented the the rule or or the the policy of using mask and then on the green is the the universal masking implementation and you can clearly see and the line the the solid line you can see how the the percentage of positive healthcare worker went up and up uh over the first few days before the universal masking and then later in late april despite the fact that the epidemic was actually very active in the community they clearly demonstrated the protection of the healthcare workers from infection by using this policy of universal masking and this can easily be extrapolated to many other situations this is sort of a high risk it's in a hospital where there were many cases we covered community transmission and it was clearly shown and you can almost see it graphically how it was logarithmic uh increase before masking and then clearly and and sustain and stay decrease after universal masking that was a an interesting paper the other recent change and this actually i heard about this yesterday but it was actually done on july 17 the cdc in in their web page they uh one more time the criteria to discontinue isolation for patients with coping 19 and i think it's relevant because it it shortens a little bit the way uh for the patients to go back to their usual activities so before if you remember we we said that the patient have to have 10 days since the beginning of symptoms and then 72 hours of being a febrile or improving they shorten that 72 hours to 24 hours if you have 10 days and you have already 24 hours without a fever you are considered non-infectious and you can actually stop the isolation if you have been placed in isolation at home and they also broaden the improvement in respiratory symptoms just improvement in symptoms because now we know that that kovid19 obviously uh not only respiratory symptoms but there's also um as you know the lens loss of sense of smell and taste uh some gi symptoms and and sore throat and other so it's not just a cough and shortness of breath but actually if you are improving clinically for 24 hours you can come off um isolation so so this is how the the new uh ending combustoration rule um is and and this is obviously based on symptom symptoms and not the test based strategy so if you use the symptom base at least 10 days have passed since simpsons first up here and only 24 hours since last february so essentially 24 hour being a febrile and obviously with improve in the symptoms alt all type of symptoms cough shortness of breath but also other symptoms also and and and the cdc in general is moving away from the test space strategy they're actually because we know now that people can have positive pcr for up to 12 weeks they're they're usually recommending you know to use the symptom base if possible except in certain certain situations that's for the general public general uh person with kobe 19. for her co-workers there was also a change and this change uh was done on july 16 and they they again recommend staying away from the test-based strategy so they said test-based strategy is no longer recommended for health care personnel that are are waiting to return back to work so they recommend they strongly recommend the use of the of the clinical or symptom-based uh except except in those patients uh who maybe are severely immunocompromised that you you want to use the still the the the test based strategy so that was a significant change and for those healthcare workers who had severe or critical illness or who are severely compromised they prolong the work exclusion to 20 days as opposed to 10 days because there's some evidence and there's like a decision memo that explains the evidence behind these decisions they they we have seen that patients with who are severely ill or or immunocompromised may shed the virus longer than than the usual non-immuno-compromised person so those are two changes in the in the rule so now uh the new the new uh policy is as follows so as usual at least 10 days have passed since since the symptom 24 hours a february improvement in general symptoms and only those with severe to critical illness or who are immuno compromised they will go 20 days since first symptom appear to be more more uh you know to actually be more conservative in that way that's that's the new end of isolation or return to work in the case of healthcare worker the new policies there was also two publications two really uh important publications on vaccines one came like three or four days ago and it was the modern vaccine it was published in the new england journal um and this is the title of the paper the modern vaccine is actually an mrna a messenger rna vaccine which is one of the first mrna vaccines that are tested in humans so this is sort of uh it's not only for covetous it's actually a significant scientific achievement for for humanity and they were able to show that this messenger rna injecting messenger rna two doses of the vaccine elicit a significant uh antibody production and this is what this this graph basically illustrate the level of antibodies against the the spike protein and you see that you know day one it's really very low ten to the one in in three in the three different doses where 45 patients 15 in each dose so 15 patients receive 25 uh 15 100 and and and 250 and you can see how uh in you know as fast as 15 14 days two weeks and then on there is a sustained uh production of of antibodies and there was also neutralizing antibodies antibody production very similar graph to these general antibody production so that was good news uh the bad news if there's any uh is that uh the second dose after the second dose or with the second dose patient develop a lot of local and systemic symptoms so there were uh you know as you can see in the bar the frequency of patients almost a hundred percent of the patient develop pain in the side of of infection especially with the high dose and also some patients develop fever fatigue and other systemic symptoms so it was pretty reactogenic uh but none of the patients were severely ill there was obviously no no death associated just just the discomfort and and the systemic symptoms of the of the vaccine with especially with the second dose more than the first law so the conclusion of the author was that it was immunogenic and in this really small only 45 subjects um the vaccine was immunogenic and relatively safe and they actually are not going ahead with the high dose they're gonna use the the intermediate those 100 micrograms for further for the phase three and further studies the other the other vaccine was polish this morning actually i i made this slide this morning uh it was published in lancet and it's the results result of the oxford vaccine the so-called oxford vaccine which is actually uh it's a vaccine head that uses a viral vector uh an adenovirus from the chimpanzee and they put the information for uh pro for the spike protein in this adenovirus uh which is actually not a human pathogen it's a it's a primate pathogen and again and they use as a control a meningococcal vaccine so they have the meningococcal vaccine one dose of the vaccine in a group of patients and a prime boosting so two doses in another group in a smaller group of only 10 patients and they actually compare the antibody production to those with natural diseases so they compare the levels to the convalescent plasma and as you can see at day 14 and after that there is a significant uh elevation of the antibodies so there's antibody production in those who were vaccinated either with the prime or the prime and the boosting uh second dose of the of the of the chimpanzee adenovirus or oxford vaccine and and the other good piece of good news is that they also measure cellular immunity they actually measure production of interferon by by t cells in these uh in these subjects and and and essentially they did have evidence of um of immune response or interferon gamma production after vaccination when they were challenged when they recharge the cells with with the spike protein so you can see the change from baseline to a few days 14 28 and 56 days after vaccination and obviously no significant change in the control in the meningococcal to the to the spike protein so so this is another another uh another early phase vaccine results very promising and again there were some adverse events nothing nothing really serious uh regarding toxicity so these two vaccines are going to move forward to the to the phase three um of research with with the thousands of subjects so hopefully we will get results before the end of the year from these two the modern and the oxford vaccine and these are only two of 23 that are already in human human testing and more than 150 vaccines candidates that are in pre-clinical studies regarding therapeutics uh there was another hydroxychloroquine study and and let me just summarize this this story this this was um hydroxychloroquine versus placebo in patients who had really early copy disease they actually tried to give it in the first day of symptoms 56 actually had had only one day of symptoms when they were given the hydroxychloroquine or placebo and the idea was to see if there was any benefit of using hydroxychloroquine uh they enrolled uh close to 500 patients in in the in in the two arms and and the dose was uh you know was enough to get good therapeutic levels hydroxychloroquine was given 800 milligrams at loading dose then 600 uh six to eight hours later and then 600 milligrams for four days a total of five days of hydroxychloroquine and they look into hospitalization admission to icu death the usual the usual uh complications and also they ask the patient for a severity of symptoms at day 14 uh using like an analog scale and interviewing the patient actually using a survey a redcat survey and the the bottom line is no difference no significant difference between hydroxychloroquine and placebo there was a numerically uh minute uh or there was a small difference in the in the symptoms with hydroxychloroquine as opposed to placebo but this was not statistically significant and no difference in death hospitalization icu admission so this is another another negative study with hydroxychloroquine and this one is it's a good randomized placebo-controlled double-blind they actually gave uh folic acid to the placebo uh instead of the hydroxyl protein so so it was it was a relatively good quality study the only the only thing is that the hospitalization was really low and this is actually the graphic from the study itself um so side effects obviously more common with with hydroxychloroquine than with the placebo 43-22 the symptoms were very similar 24 30 have persistent symptoms over 14 days hospitalization identical death identical there was one death in each in each arm uh so so very low mortality and and it was exactly the same in both times so another negative study uh on hydroxychloroquine so so so far we have uh drosophila hydroxychloroquine failing as a prophylactic as an early therapy and late therapy so so i think unless unless something dramatic occurs i think this is sort of the nail and the coughing of hydrochloroquine um regarding kobe 19 at the at least at least for the foreseeable future there was a study uh which i saw in case there's a pathologist in the in the group i i really like this microscopy these are photos of electron microscope from patients who die of kobe 19 and the message that i just want to convey is that that this virus in in severe cases is everywhere and this a and b are the trachea you can see the the spike proteins and the nights uh you know virus in the in the tracheal c and d are lungs and they it's present in the lung tissue and the pneumocyte and then these are other tissues spleen kidney and other organs and and you can see that there's viral particles or or you know structures that look like the viral particles not only in the lungs but everywhere uh in this autopsy series that was polish um in in i think it was jama oh no this is lancet i think for in the lancet and finally there's there was a story here from from the us the experience of of uh 2215 copied 19 patients admitted to icu and they actually um look at risk factors for death in this patient and they found you know and this is no surprise older age male sex obesity coronary artery disease and organ acute organ dysfunction being correlated with with death no surprise there but they were able to prove also that admission to a hospital with fewer intensive care beds was another independent risk factor for for death so so also the the size of the hospital the experience with icu management is another independent risk factor for survival uh with kobe 19 which i found it was really interesting and finally i'm not going to go into these these are two perspective studies but i really want to recommend the the reading of these two perspectives study the new stability it's a beautiful piece written by a neurologist called anna the forest from connecticut she actually described how she took care of a kobe 19 patient and the patient actually died at the end but it's a beautiful piece of literature and really inspiring read from these from these uh physicians another forest and then there's also an interesting call for uh to go for reason in time of pandemic there was this perspective in both in the new england journal one published july 17 and the other july 16 about the the need to do you know to be more scientific more objective and not listen to all of the anecdotes and and uh you know go emotional and as opposed to to to rational in in times of of of an epidemic because we made mistake and we saw the example with hydroxychloroquine all the excitement and hype that was initially in the epidemic and now that we have the the double blind placebo control studies we we see a different reality to what was painted with the initial um lower quality story so i i strongly recommend these two they're short pieces of of literature really easy read both uh from the new england journal free they're they are free in the in their in the webpage that's it so that's my that's my update for today joanna beautiful dr sosa beautiful thank you so so much we're always so appreciative and um if it's okay we we want to be able to distribute these slides um to the group if that's okay thank you so much so so much um before we go on to kind of everybody's questions and there's a lot i do want to um you know we have uh marla sivers and dr leslie hayes who have been willing to kind of uh join you on on your kind of hub team if okay and we do want to get a kind of new mexico department of health update if okay um we there's a lot going on an uptick of cases and marla i think you're ready to give us an update thank you joanna hi good afternoon everyone uh thank you nestor for including that updated guidance from cdc about discontinuation of isolation precautions that was something i really wanted to talk about today um because this is a big change cdc is now you know officially moving away from the two negative tests approach to clear someone from isolation and really recommending the time and symptom-based approach um as you said they included a decision memo that references a lot of the research that has been done that's informed those decisions there are a lot of changes as you go through the decision memo they talk about a lot of topics that really inform our policies about how we not only handle cases but how we handle people who are exposed and so the department of health is sort of combing through that right now we spent a lot of time over the weekend talking to each other and talking to contacts at cdc to try to get a clarification on some of the points that were made in the decision memo so that we could be putting out the best guidance and so as we pull that together today and tomorrow our intention is to try to synthesize all of this new information and we'll be putting out a new pawn for providers that kind of walks through some of these different scenarios and how they should be approached based on this new guidance i think one of the other important things that they talked about in the decision memo is that um you know they do not recommend testing a person uh for sars kobe 2 um within the 90 days after they've already tested positive um so meaning that once a person has a positive test um they don't believe that there's any reason to test them again within that 90-day period um because at a positive test there's more and more evidence that that positive test really just represents um viral rna particles and not true infection they also have extended that to say that people who are exposed to new cases you know within that 90 days after their original illness don't need to be quarantined again um so they're really you know adopting this 90-day approach um you know for people who are asymptomatic you know they do include and this will become more important as we move into influenza season they do include a statement about people who may become newly symptomatic during that 90-day period and if another etiology for their illness you know cannot be found like influenza or human metanemovirus or some other circulating viral infection that reinfection could be considered though there's currently and not enough information to really um define what that might look like but they do sort of leave that possibility open so again there's sort of a lot to unpack in this new decision memo and we're in you know close consultation with cdc to try to make sure we're putting out new guidance um that incorporates all of these new findings so be on the lookout for a new han message to come from department of health once we've had a chance to finish pulling all of that together thank you marla could i just may i just ask you a question um is is the hope um with the state that um for you know after relaxing the the phasing and and further kind of you know putting more restrictions on closing down indoor dining and you know somewhat you know you know making further restrictions on some of the relaxations that we're gonna slowly kind of decrease the transmission or what what is the what is the kind of um thinking right now in terms of state um in terms of the state in terms of the transmission community spread yeah that's definitely the hope that by uh you know reintroducing some of these restrictions on gatherings and indoor dining that we can um start to push that curve down again you know we've had several uh days probably 10 days in a row now 10 or 12 days of really high case loads of new infections and over the last couple of days have kind of reached the highest number of new infections we've found in a day so we're hopeful that instituting more of these restrictions um you know and maybe even rolling back some additional ones might help us get a better handle on that spread you know we're definitely seeing what other states have seen in that our new infections tend to be um among a much younger age group um and so that's concerning um because it doesn't seem that some of the restrictions we put in place are maybe targeted enough um to that age group or enough of the messaging we really focused very early on uh people who were older and had underlying comorbidities really making sure that you know they were getting the message about staying home and wearing masks and washing their hands and avoiding contact with other people so i think from a public health perspective we really need to adjust our messaging to be reaching a younger group of people now because that's where we're seeing the biggest growth in cases but that's definitely our hope that by reducing some of that close contact that we can really push that back down again thank you so much marla for everything you're doing i wanted to reach out now to um dr leslie hayes she had she wanted uh dr hayes is kind of part of our expert core and she wanted to talk about a study i think if perhaps dr sosa hadn't and i wasn't sure that he had leslie are you there yeah i didn't hear him mention that it's an early release from emerging infectious disease to be published in october but they did contract tracing for um uh 59 000 contacts of 5700 coronavirus cases and they found that household contacts had an 11.8 percent rate of transmission which is much lower than i would have guessed and non-household contacts it was actually only 1.9 but what is important as far as reopening schools is they broke it down by age zero to nine definitely had less transmission it was about five percent but it was not zero i mean we've been hoping they didn't transmit at all but they found it was about five percent 10 to 19 now had much higher transmission than the general population their rate of transmission was about 18 and so unfortunately i think this has some significant implications as far as reopening the schools and um i i think we can't just say that the kids can go to school and everybody's going to be fine because it does look like there's definitely going to be risk to any teachers with risk factors and there's also risk of the kids bringing it home so this study this is joanna leslie this was in south korea yes hang on just a second i'll give you the name it was contact tracing during coronavirus disease outbreak south korea 2020 and it will be published in emerging infectious diseases um in october i will go ahead and put the link in right now i think i think our kent knows where he already has it in oh he's way ahead of me good thank you great great thanks leslie very very helpful you're always on the lookout for the your kind of intersection between marla with the public health and and the and the you know the and you know pediatrics and family medicine so thank you very helpful yes as for trying to reopen looking at reopening schools um carla i'm going to turn it over to you thanks joanna leslie while we have you on the line uh you just can you want to just ask the question that you asked in the in the chat okay so hopefully this won't be an issue anymore since if they're not recommending me testing anybody um for the pcr once they test positive but the code is a hoax folks have been really big on oh every time somebody tested positive it counts as another case so people who are tested four times and had four positives it's really only one case but they get counted four times and i just wanted to know how does new mexico make sure we don't double count so that i can have an actual argument against them because i'm sure we're not double counting but yeah thank you for that question and i've received several questions along this line uh recently and wondered sort of where this was all coming from all of a sudden so our surveillance system is a person-based system so we count people as cases not test results as cases so someone who receives multiple positive tests will be counted as a case once um and we do that through matching people on you know name and date of birth and other variables like phone number and address to make sure that we're not creating duplicate records um and if we do have a duplicate record that's created for someone um through our qa process that sort of gets discovered and those cases um those investigations get merged um and you'll see in the press release very often there will be a you know a statement about you know there was a duplicate and it's now been merged and that's why the case count in this county reduced by one or something along those lines so we do clean them up as we come across them but there is some logic in the surveillance system up front that does you know matching on different demographic variables to make sure that we're not creating duplicate cases so um it is the case counts are based upon people and not on test results how about the denominator i know one of my friends has had four cova tests over the last month because she's been getting medical work up does she get counted that four different tests were done and were negative or does she only get counted once so if you look on the um you know on the website and you have the total number of tests done so that is the total number of tests um so her four tasks would be in that total number of tests even though as a case in the number of cases she's only counted one time thank you marla that's super helpful there's a couple of questions also just about the guidance the city said both of you talked about um whether that applies to nursing homes or homeless shelters other congregate settings or if if those same criteria apply marla do you want to talk about that yeah they you know they don't particularly call out and the new guidance nursing homes or other congregate settings um but the department of health has you know over the last um probably i think six or eight weeks since we last put out a haunt about this really encouraged all settings not to use a test-based method i know that individual nursing homes still have policies where they are requiring you know one or two tests before they'll accept a transfer from the hospital we are actively discouraging that and we'll be continuing to do so and we're going to discuss this again on a nursing home call i'm actually having this afternoon at 2 30. um so department of health does continue to try to uh get you know facilities of all types to adopt the standard guidance and not kind of come up with these own sort of creative protocols of their own though i know that that is still happening thank you marlon there were a couple of questions actually even in the um pre uh registration questions about if somebody's already on that sort of the path of testing um how do you kind of get them out of it like you said are you trying to convince people just to stop and then how do you do it if it's already you're in the middle of the testing protocol marla do you have any go ahead yeah i think um you know they don't really provide sort of a path or an off wrap once you get on that testing protocol however i would say that you know based on this new guidance if your patient does not fall into a person who one of these other caveats so a person who is severely immunocompromised or who had a very uh prolonged or severe illness there's no reason to apply this test based approach for discontinuing isolation and i would say use the time and symptom-based method thank you very very helpful um there's a question i think that i've heard a bunch of people ask actually um about it says since the number of asymptomatic cases is significant how effective is it to be taking temperatures before entering entering into public spaces any anybody have an opinion necessary what do you no i mean i think it's it's uh obviously it doesn't it doesn't detect the asymptomatic obviously so we're going to have a percentage but i think it's it's sort of a one more measure one one more thing that it's at if if you identify you know some federal patients uh it's helpful but obviously it's not it's not infallible and we know that a lot of people do not have a fever and also the fever is not permanent so you can you can have fever at some point and know when they measure you early in the morning so i think it has some limitation but i think it's another another strategy and there's also some behavioral thing i mean it makes people aware that we are in a special situation that we need to report symptoms if we are so i think it has that other added psychological more than than scientific thing the fact that that they check when you get into a into a facility it reminds people to to uh to keep distance and to wear their mask and because we are in a special really difficult situation i don't know marla what do you think but it's you know yeah i agree taking a temperature is certainly not gonna you know um get everyone who doesn't have a fever which we know is you know many people um i you know and i think anecdotally i can say that i know people have been um you know sort of caught in this way when they're being screened for um you know coming to work for example in long-term care facilities where they've come in and said no i don't have any symptoms but are febrile when their temperature is taken and that's kind of been the first indicator that they may be becoming ill but you know how well that works um or are we just sort of doing something to to reassure ourselves that's not that effective i think um you know you could make an argument either way but i agree with nestor it does sort of create a pause a time out where you're at least asking the questions and getting people um to consider how they're feeling before they enter one question that i i think we should add this is one question i think we should add is have you had a are you awaiting results of a covet tester is anyone in your household waiting because on the covet groups i'm on on facebook a shocking number of um physicians have had people come into the clinic for a well-woman exam or you know a skin ration at the end of it say oh yeah by the way could you look up the covet test i had done you know two days ago only to find out it's positive and you know so i think that's definitely a question that should be asked because people are not following the isolation recommendations after getting this test carl i think you're muted sorry sorry um so the question from peggy spencer here in albuquerque about the the the question is are the younger patients who are compromising much of their recent surge fairing any better clinically or do we do we really know that yet marla do you or nestor nestor go ahead yeah i can tell you in general i mean the mortalities everywhere are less for for younger people so they do have less complications more asymptomatic so i think that doesn't change but if you have a lot of young people you're going to have a small percentage become a significant absolute number of patients in the hospital and i have heard from my colleagues that we are seeing more younger patients admitted to the hospital but i think it's just the fact that we are having more young young patients affected by this disease i volunteer in the rcc in the respiratory care center to test and i was i mean i saw i worked there for four hours and you know 90 of the patients that i interviewed and tested were all young people were young people that have been exposed one way or the other oh yeah we went you know did this with our friends uh it's amazing the number i i didn't see any old folks being tested there and i count all anything older than myself so so there was nobody over 58 and they were all you know 20 you know 25 20 30 year old uh in the rcc being tested with symptoms thank you um there's a couple questions about anastasmia in these patients and and whether or not somebody mentioned that it had been a long time the patient had that after after the other symptoms resolved that they still have that do you do you have any information nester about how long this is lasting in people no honestly i haven't seen the duration and now that you asked me that there's a whole um and this is something that i see in in case reports and mostly press releases of these post-covet symptoms i think we have to wait a little bit but i think there there is enough evidence that the people after they recover from kobe they end up with having like a post-viral syndrome with fatigue persistent headaches malaise and i think we are going to see very soon publications to that uh or you know how long the symptoms last also the pulmonary if there is pulmonary sequelae pulmonary fibrosis or not uh that's going to be another thing that we are going to learn as we move further into the into the epidemic and more people have recovered and we can actually study them great thank you nestor back to you joanna great thank you nestor thanks carla um just wanted to ask um you nestor um or leslie um if there's been any change or perhaps uh prevalent uh prevalence changes in the illness uh with coveting in children um we know we're seeing it in in larger numbers in in younger population 40 year old and and younger but what about in the kids is we know about the inflammatory uh disease and wanted to let everybody know actually um that in on the critical care echo this week on thursday morning we're going to have a special presentation in that the inflammatory disease in in kids with covet but just wanted to see if anything if there's anything on the horizon regarding changes in prevalence uh with covet in kids no i haven't seen anything i mean the latest was just the report of the the you know characterization of the inflammatory syndrome there have been a couple of reviews and and sort of uh you know review of the clinical presentation and a more you know lengthy description of the syndrome but that aside from that i haven't seen any anything any game changers regarding kids or either any transmission or or anything else thank thank you nestor um i wanted to turn back now to uh dr sebold i'm not sure if he's on audio or video today but he has a question that goes back to kind of the school age kids um uh do you want to un unmute dr stevold um and ask your question i think possibly to marla um sure to marla or dr sosi the one just drilling down on that one age group that we're worried about that 10 to 18 10 to 19 do we know within that group what they are not is whether they're transmitting or whether they are just ones that because of behavior and all sorts of other things they are ones that are testing positive can we drill down to that or is that more global than a more global number than we can actually get to within our statistical analysis yeah this is marla i've i've not seen it sort of uh broken down to that level we're really only breaking it down to sort of regional level now um i think it would be perhaps hard um to get a statistic statistically significant um you know number of cases in that age group to be you know in each area of the state to be able to really make any statement about the are not in that group and i think um part of the concern around returning to school is not only um how likely children are to transmit the infection to each other or what severity of illness children might have but um really looking at the potential health risks to the staff in the school the teachers you know the aids the librarians the women who you know people who work in the cafeteria um people who uh work in the housekeeping service so you have people who are older um and do sort of fall into that higher risk group who would be exposed to children um so i think that's one of the the big questions that you know is kind of tied into this conversation about is it safe to open schools that kind of goes beyond how children specifically are impacted by the illness yeah i get that completely i'm trying to find a way to wrap my arms around figuring out whether or not as we move forward i i've seen this huge number of kids in this age group and i can't decide you know what what is their viral load what is you know how much are they actually shedding or is it simply they have cohorted so tightly together as soon as there were no restrictions that they were transmitting back and forth to each other um but it seems like their severity of illness is very low on the average i'm wondering if they are shedding virus at the same rate as uh older or more ill patients nestor do you um do you have any thoughts about that yeah i remember i mean i i don't know exactly about that age group but in some of the publications that i have seen patients that are asymptomatic they have sort of a less robust immune response and i've seen at least one publication in which the viral law was slightly higher in those asymptomatic than the symptomatic with high antibody high neutralizing antibodies so so we really have to wait and see how i don't think they have measured enough kids and and young people uh viral loads to make a general determination but you know i would be very cautious either way i mean and there's also um that that young kids even if they have if only five percent of them are are transmitting they they are sort of efficient transmitters of respiratory disease we know how how influenza and other respiratory issues behave in schools they you know they really they are experts exchanging uh secretions in the schools to put it in a way so i wouldn't be if it's five percent and they go and kiss the teacher and talk to her in her face at some point i mean i don't want to be that teacher in front of a kobe a kid uh hugging and kissing the teacher that he hasn't seen in a year so it's sort of worrisome i think we need to to be very careful and and hopefully we'll have some experience i mean there are schools opens in europe in some of the cities in europe and i i'm going to try to look into the literature and see if they have published a transmission um within schools in other in other places different from the united states and see if we can learn from that experience but it's it's it's worrisome i mean even if it's low it's it may be amplified by the by the fact how kids behave there's a popular meme going around facebook that right now that says that um anyone um who thinks kids are gonna socially distance has never you know had anything to do with kids and you know within 10 minutes of the first recess they're going to be licking their palms and running after each other yelling corona cooties corona cooties so we've about a quarter of our our pre-registration questions have been about school so this is very apropos this conversation so so thank you all um thanks dr siebel um some we've had two or three questions today also nestor about anasmia and about the fact that um many of our clinicians are seeing that um they've been reporting that a lot of their patients have seen that the losses smell is lasting a very long time even after the majority of their symptoms have gone away um have you read about that or see seen that at all no i haven't really seen i'm going to look i promise next week i'll find some i'm sure in the ent literature there's probably a neurology they're probably both looking at the anastasia in you know more detail i have seen just the you know broad brushes like it's one of the symptoms becoming really prevalent if you ask for it you're going to find it things like that but i haven't really seen duration severity and much on the on the pathophysiology et cetera so i'm going to look into that great thank you thank you um um another question i i made for for either nestor probably for nestor or marlar or maybe next week we could get a carissa back for someone from the labs but um just wanted to know if there's any updates or recommendations regarding any new point of care testing or home testing or anything new on the horizon regarding testing yeah i don't have an update to be honest i haven't seen it i don't know tricord because i've talked to carissa in different settings they're working on validating some other newer tests saliva based tests even different sampling as opposed to nasopharyngeal but i i don't have really uh an update on that um there was a question um about vaccines and um progress and do you think that vaccines will be kind of the answer and if so how long do you think um you know we're going to be taking care of patients with covet even after the vaccines you know start coming into play what is your kind of overall feeling about that yeah in this i'm i'm just going to repeat what i have heard from dr fausti and other experts i mean at least the phase three studies if if they if there are no surprises with the modern autosphere and and and one chinese product that it's it's already in in phase three i think we are going to get an answer by the end of the year um then from that it comes the regulatory part which i hope is going to be really quick and then the manufacturer and some of these companies have already uh starting to plan or or actually um you know they have started to manufacture some of these vaccines for for early distribution next year so if i if i can make a guess and obviously i could be completely wrong i would say that in the first quarter of next year we'll have maybe one or two commercially available vaccines um but there's a lot of unknowns i mean we are only seeing i show today phase one phase one two for the oxford uh 90 let me remind everybody that 90 to 95 of the products that enter clinical trials fail for some reason toxicity um some unexpected adverse event and things so so i wouldn't be surprised that's the rule of the of the land 90 over 90 of the products that start uh human trials they end up in the trash can essentially or are being you know changed or improved but not not necessarily in the cbs or the walgreens pharmacy next door so i i want to cautious people but yeah the way things are moving my prediction it would be you know first quarter of next year we'll hopefully have at least one of these vaccines uh and then we'll start the the the deployment the other thing is that i have already seen in the social media and things the anti-vaccine movement activating themselves so so we're gonna have to deal with having the vaccine manufacturing enough being available here in new mexico and then also how much opposition and how many people are going to refuse it and then we're not going to have the herd immunity because we need a you know 40 to 80 percent of people with immunity to to achieve that her immunity that we we are aiming for but if let's say 50 of the of the population refuse to take the vaccine because they are afraid of of safety issue then it's going to be another another you know another hurdle in in our in our way to to ending this epidemic excellent uh excellent points i i really hope uh we can kind of uh you know get get through that get through that group um i wanted to ask you one more question turn it back to carla um daniel sal saltman had a good question and we haven't talked about this for a while but the fda just approved pool testing and wanted to see nestor if you had any comments about that i'm sorry can you repeat the question sure it's in it's in the chat from dr saltman or daniel saltman about the fda approving pooled testing and wanted to see if you might have any anything to say about that or talk about that or explain that right no i haven't seen the the fda announcement i'm glad that that's how it's occurred yeah just to remind pulling the idea of pooling is doing either five or ten uh you take five or ten samples and then you test them together you do a pcr and if you have a positive signal then you de-aggregate those five or ten or whatever number it's approved and then you do individual so and that's a way to to test especially asymptomatic patients in a in a faster way but we actually asked this question to clarissa and because the automated system is so adapted to individual testing as opposed to pool testing they need to do some changes in their processes to make that really efficient uh but i'm glad to see that the fda has approved because that that maybe helps um especially with mass testing when you're testing a lot of people a group a large group of asymptomatic people to detect infection um in some ways it should shorten the time uh to run those tests but you have to you have to have an automated system to do it efficiently and really not waste more time when the the aggregation thanks nestor carlo back to you yeah thank you i just wanted to let everybody remind everybody that the cme um link went into the chat at about 12 45 so if you what do you want to see me please fill that out and we would love to hear your feedback and and anything you have to help us improve the clinic as well um a couple of interesting questions let me get back in there um one from jeffrey miller do you want to unmute yourself and just ask your question because i think it's super important to um here in new mexico uh you're still muted there you go come on we we can hear you now okay so uh my question is the time to wait for a test as well as the time to get results is significantly increasing does that change any of the recommendations of whom we send for testing ie similar to when the test was first available we'd advise some to just stay home um or do we continue to advise everyone of concern to get tested that's a great question i don't know marla if you have any insight into that um i can tell you that there um is a lot of discussion about this um at the department of health currently um as we sort of um you know stretch our testing resources um over the last few weeks with expanded recommendations sort of that anybody um be tested we are recommending that people you know who are symptomatic be tested people with known exposures to confirmed cases visa be uh tested and then there's um some expanded testing that's happening in long-term care facilities so i think um more to come from department of health about how to best use our testing resources because the increase in turnaround times and the pressure that it's put on um laboratory supplies and reagents is definitely of a concern to everyone and we want to make sure we have tests available for the people who truly need it so it is something that's being discussed and i would expect you'll probably hear some additional guidance from us about that soon and jeffrey just a comment on your question that's a very important question i have seen and this is in a theoretical perspective in modeling when they when they model time turn around time it's a critical value i mean if it takes a long time to to to start the isolation to get the peop to the persons in isolation because of delaying the testing most of these models predict that you know even if you do the contact racing it's probably too late uh to to to a certain degree so it's really critical um you know it increase the number of testing but also do not delay too much in acting on it because then it's probably worth it if you give up and i've seen people who wait seven days in other states and other countries and you know seven days is it's a lot of transmission in the first few days of disease so so you need to have the results really quickly in order to be really useful otherwise it's just informative but not for the for the from the epidemiological standpoint so there's a lot of modeling on that and it's critical timing it's critical even more than sensitivity of the test if you lose a little bit of sensitivity but you you get to act on most of the results rapidly it's even more important than to have like a 98 sensitivity it's better to have a you know 90 uh-huh but i still have an answer in in a short period of time thank you thank you nestor we have so many great questions it's hard to choose um which one this is getting the last question but it's very interesting so the question is if we are unsure previous covet infection confers immunity how do we test a person with previous covid who now has significant symptoms worrisome for infection again and it's an it's an unanswerable question really but what do you what do you think after the only thing i have thought i mean this is something that you need to do in a research setting um obviously cdc is not recommending testing and testing because they're going to be intermittently positive as marla said but for a research point of view it would be interesting to sequence the second virus and i mean have the first virus and the second virus or the second isolation and sequence it uh with a you know deep sequencing genomic sequences to compare to make sure that is the same that it's it's in fact just a excretion of the same original infection as opposed to a new infection that what i would do from from a research point of view uh to try to compare the the the genetic structure of the of the of the two viruses but not on a routine based it's a that's a very expensive and and and cumbersome way but in order to answer the question is this a real infection or this or if this is just a reactivation um that that would be something that i would try to to look into uh from a research perspective to try to to define and we do that all the time in infectious disease if somebody comes with a pseudomonas and then again has a pseudomonas we we try to do a genetic study to see if the same or if a different uh infection that the person has acquired thank you so much so i'm going to turn it back up over to joanna we just have a couple minutes left but thanks everyone for the great questions yes thank you everybody on the line for for attending and uh being with us and for your amazing questions your that you put in the pre-registration we we take them very seriously we kind of group them together and we got through most of them and we love all the chat questions too that come in we so appreciate dr sosa marla dr hayes and everybody on the line thank you nestor for the powerpoints um please join us if you can also on on mondays at two o'clock we have a first responder resiliency echo for all clinicians we talk about uh post-traumatic stress and resiliency and self-care uh it's been it's been really a great uh echo for those uh in need of some uh just a boost and we've got great speakers from psychiatry and psychology and uh emergency medicine and all over the country um also on thursdays you know dr hart harkins is running the critical care echo like i said that's thursdays at eight o'clock and this thursday she's having a couple speakers from uh the boston area hospitals talking about the um in the multi-inflammatory syndrome in children related to covid so thank you all again and please fill out that cme uh feedback form if you can we'll see you next week take care be safe everybody,,7/20/2020
13,trying to get to those we have a bunch of questions that were from pre-registration but we'll also try to get to the questions in the chat um we would like for you just to use the chat box to submit questions don't we would ask that you not answer questions in the chat unless you're one of the hub hub team members um lastly uh our digital librarian kent is putting stuff into the chat uh very uh regularly through the session and please if you take advantage of those resources and click on those you can have access to all of those resources as well so without further ado i'm going to go ahead and introduce our hub team um and i'll i'll just go from one person to the next um i want to welcome dr sosa marla sivers and also leslie hayes i believe is on who's one of our primary care hub team members so i'm not sure i'm going to go to you first and if you'll just introduce yourself and give your update and then i'll just go to marla and leslie thank you thank you thank you carla hi i'm nestor salsa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unmh let me see if i can share my screen i have some papers that i like to comment hello can you see my screen okay good okay so let's let's let's jump into it so last week i had a couple of questions uh from the audience regarding an osmia so today i looked for a couple of papers on an osmium which i think it's an interesting uh symptom that patients are with kobe 1i team are developing um there's also another question is how long kobe 19 symptoms last and if there's a like a postcobit syndrome so i'm going to address that and then we'll go through some other publication there's an interesting publication in yama about new genetic variants associated with kobe 19 um a paper on social distance in population density that i i thought it was very very interesting here in the united states and then sort of a small piece of good news uh regarding breastfeeding neonates and kobe 19 so we'll go over those so announcement the question that that that uh um the participants were actually asking us during the the session was it you know how what is the mechanism for this uh anosmia or losses sense of smell and to some degree also lost sense of taste how frequent it is and how long does it last so there are a couple of papers um and i want to just first start with like sort of a basic review of the anatomy of the nasal epithelium and actually there are two types of of epithelium in the nose the regular respiratory epithelium which is in the bottom which is very similar throughout the respiratory tract and then in the nose uh we have uh the so-called olfactory epithelium which is uh it's actually the the one that actually can detect odors and it has these neurons in red that have their dendrites and they are really like chemical receptors and then these uh neurons send a message to the olfactory bulb inside the the skull and then from there to the brain so that's that's the the usual so the the big question here and it's a question that these authors ask is you know what is the mechanism what type of cells of all of these cells listed here what are really affected by by copying 19 and this is important because for instance neurons do not regenerate very easily as you know when a person have a stroke um you know neuron death is associated with significant significant uh issues so so what they found they actually um study which of these cells have actually the have the receptor the h2 receptor that the virus uses to enter the cell and and they also detected the presence of the core receptors and they were able to determine that neurons mature neurons the ones in red in the olfactory epithelium apparently are not conducive to infections so are other cells not neurons the ones that are affected and probably the most demonstrative um uh graph is here when they stay in uh the cell this is a microscopic uh photograph with with um immunohistochemical and and fluorescent staining when they stain it for the ace receptor which is in green only the the connective tissue or the sustentacular cells were um actually show this receptor not the neurons so the neurons were not uh really um or did not have or expressed the ac2 receptor protein and and i thought not to be involved in the in the infection they are affected because of the inflammation in the olfactory but probably not um not directly by the virus so that that's uh somewhat um good news because we know that neurons are not easily uh recover so so the the conclusion of this study which was a very extensive study i think is going to be published in one of the science uh papers that the primary infection uh it's of non-neuronal cell types rather than than than um than than the other cells and they are responsible for the anesthesia and related uh disturbance in perception so so that was good and that is related to another publication that i review regarding the the the duration of the sentence and for instance this is a study um from the it's published actually in the ent literature in europe they actually follow 417 kobi positive patients in 12 european hospitals and they asked him they they sent a survey to this to these 417 subjects and asked them about symptoms of both olfactory dysfunction and taste dysfunction or with statutory dysfunction and they found a very high percentage of 85.6 uh um admitted to of having some degree of olfactory dysfunction most of them would were complete an osmia and also 88 had gustatory dysfunction so it's a very frequent symptoms and it can it also present even before other symptoms in 12 of the cases it was like the first kobe symptom that they experienced and in more or less twenty percent of them one in five um had no other national symptoms so this was not always secondary to nasal congestion it was an osmia on its own which is which is uh really interesting and how long does it last well they follow this patient and they continue to do interviews with them and they detected um that you know close to to 73 of the patient recover the sense of smell in eight days so this seems to be a sort of a short-lived um dysfunction and that it goes along with the fact that it's probably not due to destruction of the neurons but just uh infection of the other cells which are um which recover faster than neurons like that so as you can see in this graph almost you know 90 some percent were already already recovered over 90 recover uh in less than two weeks uh the sense of smell so that was that was i think uh to us to at some point certain point reassurance obviously there was a small percentage of patients who have persistent anomia but the great the great majority had a recovery and something related to this is also in general the duration of symptoms and this was this publication uh in in the cdc um morbidity and mortality weekly report in which they study the symptom duration of over 200 patients here in the u.s and they actually interview the patients and the main conclusion of this interview was um that uh up to 35 of the population overall uh have persistent symptoms so this is this is a disease that apparently um you know doesn't go away completely although the anosmia as we saw result in the great majority of patients other symptoms like headaches fatigue um backache and other symptoms seems to to persist even in younger patients they asked the the to to a group of 18 to 34 year olds and they had more or less one in five had persistent symptoms after two to three weeks which is when they did the final the final interview so so it's you know something that makes us think that this is not just an acute infection that last couple days but people do have symptoms for longer than that and i'll show you the this graph basically illustrates the presence of symptoms when they were tested when they had the kobe test and then when they were interviewed two to three weeks after and you can see you know the the the light blue it's much longer than than the than the blue bars but there's a significant percentage of patients who still three weeks out of their initial kobe test remains symptomatic they have either you know fatigue persistent cough headaches body eggs and many other symptoms uh close to 40 uh 35 to 40 percent of the patient has symptoms um all the way to two to three weeks out so so it's interesting i think we're going to hear much more about this poscobit syndrome and it's going to be characterized better but this is sort of the first uh one of the first uh post copy uh duration of symptoms that we see in the literature because most of the literature have been really concentrated in hospitalized severe coping and we know very well the presentation but this slowly um answer the question or how long do the symptoms last the other interesting factor is that um the the they analyze which were the factors related to going back to normal and as usual all age was associated with longer duration the number of core morbid conditions was also associated with a longer duration things like hypertension obesity and even some psychiatric psychiatric uh diseases were also associated with longer symptoms so it's interesting we still you know need to to see more about this but it's it's interesting to see how some of these things may linger for three to four weeks after the initial diagnosis the other really very interesting and somewhat more sort of complex paper was this about genetic variants as as i we have discussed here before there have been an association with some findings in chromosome 3 and 9 one associated with the blood types and that's still um under discussion and another uh uh genome-wide association in in a different position in in chromosome three but this study that i'm gonna present is actually it's very small it's only four patients but it's really really interesting they these are investigators in in the netherlands they actually had four patients really young patients between 20 and 30 years with very severe covet and they decided to to to study their genetics and they found that both of these um book this this four patients had they were all males and they had an abnormality in in a protein called the toll-like receptor seven uh and now i'll train a second what the tolerance receptor seven um um means and even one of them in the in one of the families one uh has such a severe case that he actually he actually died of kobe 19 and these were two unrelated family in fact the family one was where originally from the netherlands where uh white uh caucasian european descent and family two were from african descent but what a coincidence that both of them had an uh abnormalities in the tolerance receptor seven and and this is sort of the the gene and the protein the family one had a deletion and the other one has substitution in in one amino acid and that rendered the tl r7 the tolerance receptor seven non-functional they did studies to see the function of the proteins in these four um subjects and the conclusion was that they had a non-functional tolerance receptor seven so it was a an association and why is torreira receptor seven important and they explained this in the paper torilite receptors are sort of sensing proteins that we have in our cells that detect foreign material if for instance in the case of tolerance sector seven they are the the and both three and seven are in charge of detecting single-stranded rna um from viruses so so it's sort of the first um sort of sensing protein that alerts the the cell that there's a foreign invader there's there's single stranded rna that doesn't belong there that it's actually a virus rna and this uh activation of the tolerance tolerant receptor ends up uh related to the production of interferon as you can see in this graph there are some intermediate kinases that are activated uh in one of those kinases goes into the nuclei and actually stimulus or stimulates the nucleus to produce to activate the production of interferon so these subjects these four subjects had a deficiency in the sensing protein the torah receptor seven and and that means that they probably had a decreased production of interferon which we know is a natural uh a protein a natural antiviral protein that we all secrete when we have a viral infection so it was interesting to find this and and i think that the the conclusion was that that they found this rare torah receptor seven and for me the the key points are obviously that not everybody has this type of mutation this is a rare mutation but it actually opens the door to explaining these and other uh situations in which we see severe copy 19 and it's also may have some therapeutic implications because we see if these young p young patients die of kobe 19 or have very severe copenhagen because they were not able to produce interference maybe interfering can move up in the in the in the therapeutic environmentary and in fact the nih the it's starting a rendezvous interferon study the act iii and we are going to participate in that in that so it makes sense uh and is you know somehow related to this interesting uh sort of basic science uh study published in in the jama the other study is more epidemiological and and i think it was really pretty elegant the the authors also published in jama in july 23rd they actually did a correlation or association between social distancing measured by by uh cell phone uh technology checking you know mobility of people people going to to businesses and and beauty parlors and different places they also correlated population densities in the cities and and the temperature the median uh temperature in in those cities and they correlated with the with the reproduction number or the rt um uh in these different cities and they actually did this study throughout the united states there were 46 states 211 counties that they selected which represented um more or less 55 of the population of the united states from february 25 to april 23 so it was in the moment where cities were starting to to implement social distancing measures and different other public health and what they found was first um a clear correlation between social distancing um and and disease uh transmissibility or rt so the the the more restrictive cities actually had a smaller rt also there was a clear correlation between population density and rt the more densely populated and this makes sense the more densely populated a cd is the more transmission um occurs in those cities so there was a correlation between both of those things and also there was interesting correlation between the temperature the cooler the temperature the higher the transmission to a certain degree and you can see that the in the graph on the left is it's um um when it was two degrees and 11 the degree centigrade in the one on the right with a lower rt so there was there was correlation between density obviously between social distancing and also to some degree with with temperature and actually the temperature was interesting because as the the weather got warmer from minus nine in the in the winter in february to 10 degrees centigrade there was a like a steady decline in the rt it went down all to 10 but then when the temperature go went up again the the rt started to increase probably explaining that people were going out and doing more activities so so in this graph you can see obviously viral related uh transmission issues and also the fact that people congregate more um or go out more depending on the on the temperature so this is a very interesting paper it's very complicated people need to read it in detail but it but it really correlates all of these these parameters and can help us um reach conclusions and how to intervene in the future so the conclusions of this of this i'm sorry the conclusions of the authors of this paper was that there was obviously a relationship between social distancing population density and temperature and decreasing the rt in the different communities or counties to study in this paper and finally the the last story that i'm going to just mention it's uh it's a sort of a good newspaper this was an observational cohort story in three hospitals in new york uh they actually follow all of the neonates um that that were born from mothers who have kobe 19 so all of the mother had kobe 19 and they actually followed the neonates for the next few days they allow the mothers to practice skin to skin care and to breastfeed in the delivery room and then continue with their feeding if they if they uh wanted to and they actually measure on these kids the the pcr basically to see they were infected by their mothers the mothers obviously uh were instructed to to follow certain hygiene measures like hand washing wearing a mask when they were breastfeeding the babies or interacting with the babies they actually follow i mean initially there were 1400 deliveries but he ended up following just those who have were copied positive mothers so they study in total uh 106 neonates and 78 of them uh breastfed um and they continue to to to practice breastfeeding up to all the way one to one month after after birth and the main finding was that none zero zero of these babies uh 120 at the 24 hours uh 82 that were tested at five to seven days of life and then 14 days of life so none of them were infected from mothers who were in the acute kobe 19 following these uh you know general hygiene uh rules and and wearing a mask when they were uh breastfeeding the baby so really a very uh positive story in that way and finally so so finally i just uh want to remind everybody that the back to school guidance by cdc were published and and i'm not going to go into them because they're really lent but they basically support uh going back to school but they give some guidance on how to reopen the schools um how to prepare the school um to for the reopening so i it's it's an interesting interesting reading okay so that that's my update for today thank you thank you so much nestor that was excellent um i'm just going to go quickly to leslie could you introduce yourself leslie hayes and if you have any updates go ahead and leslie hayes um family and addiction medicine in el centro family health in espanola i just wanted to comment that overdose death rates have been going up again um and anecdotally i know i've seen huge amounts of relapse in my patients i think it's just due to the stress and trauma going on as long as it has and so just something to be aware of and to watch out and i think all of us are starting to see bad outcomes among people who have not gotten general primary care so really doing everything we can to get primary care because folks are not getting care for their diabetes and their hypertension and we're realizing that we are really doing a lot of good by providing care for diabetes and hypertension and addiction medicine normally so thank you leslie and marla could you introduce yourself and give us any update you have from the department of health sir thank you carla hi marla sievers infectious disease epidemiologist with the new mexico department of health um unfortunately new mexico continues to move in the wrong direction in terms of identification of new cases last week we had one of our um you know largest days where we identified 343 new cases and we're coming off several days of more than 300 new cases identified each day that information is available on the cvnmhealth.org dashboard we're now over 19 000 cases and over 600 deaths because of this information you know fed into the decision that the governor made last week to delay school reopening um so in case you didn't hear that in-person classes are going to be delayed until at least labor day and um that decision will be re-evaluated at that point and there's more information again on the website about that in the press release um i do want to acknowledge something that i know everyone has been dealing with and that is that our test turnaround time has been impacted um over the last about week and a half that's largely due to supply chain disruptions in uh different you know test reagents and laboratory supplies many of our hospital partners decided last week to stop doing asymptomatic testing asymptomatic screening in part because of this impact to the supply chain to be able to turn tests around in an appropriate amount of time asymptomatic people can still be tested at one of the public health offices and again on our website you can find which locations are available for testing each day because we are experiencing these supply chain disruptions i would recommend that people contact go to the website and then contact the testing site before heading out there in person to make sure that a test is going to be available the existing public health order which reduces the in-person dining um restrictions on um capacity for outdoor dining etc um expires at the end of the week so um i would be on the lookout for uh you know a new press conference sometime this week um from the governor's office which will update the existing public health order which is set to expire that's all i had thank you so much marla there are a ton of questions about testing actually i'm going to try to put them to uh sort of summarize some of them but the other question just is about contact tracing as i mean as many of you may have seen the front page of the paper today there's it was really highlighted there just the issue with the number of people infected the number of contacts and can you talk a little bit about the status of contact tracing at the at the doh sure contact tracing continues to be you know one of our most important interventions to be able to identify people who have been exposed and make sure that they are quarantined and isolated appropriately so a tremendous amount of resources from the department of health continues to be put into contact tracing efforts and you know that has been expanded to different partners in state government everything from the environment department um the agriculture department um you know other divisions in department of health it's really been all hands on deck to make sure that we are fulfilling this contact tracing function as well as the case investigation so it continues to be a primary focus for department of health as we do continue to investigate each case individually get a list of contacts from those people and then attempt to reach all of those contacts to let them know they've been exposed and give them the quarantine and testing advice thank you marla um heather brisley i don't see you on my screen but i think you're here i just wanted to if you can and um unmute yourself and ask you had a question about testing as well just you said that there are things that weren't available on the website can you just talk about what your question is my question was mostly just in follow-up to last week's um changes in uh testing protocols for return to work or discharged to a facility from a hospital stay after covert those kinds of things and then we linked to the cbc website i was trying to find some sort of uh like a local guideline for new mexico docs this is what we're doing now and um i couldn't find that on the department of health website and i don't know is the default just go to cdc and use their protocols especially that hospital discharge question i couldn't find any um follow-up guideline or anything and i didn't know where to look so we are working on updating the new mexico specific guidelines um to adopt the new cdc guidance so until we get that published yes please default to the through the cdc guidance and i know there's you know ongoing questions about long-term care facilities requiring a negative test before accepting a transfer we have discouraged that practice however you know individual long-term care corporations do continue to include that in their own policies and i don't think that the new cdc guidance um addresses that topic specifically anywhere thank you marla um nestor there was a question in the chat about from dan saltman about a new article that talks about the different types of source code v2 sk and g um and wondering what your opinion is about this so what are what are your thoughts about the different types of of stars kobe 2 and whether they explain the differences in death rates etcetera yeah no i haven't seen much in that i mean the last thing i saw was the g-type with the mutation that apparently uh increases the infectivity of the virus because it changes the affinity of the of the spike protein for the receptor but i haven't seen any anything on the relationship between the the the changes for the the subtypes of virus and their lethality or or severity of disease i haven't read anything i can try to investigate on that thank you nestor um another question about testing um in terms in nursing homes marla or i don't know what the i don't know what the guidance is about how often people because people in nursing homes are making up or so much of the i mean the people who die from covet how often they should be tested is there guidance on that the cdc does have some guidance around that and um there's sort of you know three prongs but it looks like we were going to be moving into the next phase of reopening one piece was to test all nursing home residents and staff prior to that reopening and so that has been done here in new mexico and in addition we are doing weekly what we're calling surveillance testing so a percentage of all residents and staff at nursing homes and assisted living facilities are tested each week um so these are asymptomatic people testing is happening to attempt to identify and isolate cases early and then of course if there's anyone who's symptomatic or if a positive is identified in the facility then we move to sort of a different phase of testing which is a hundred percent testing so testing all uh previously negative residents and staff each week until we've gone at least 14 days in the facility without identifying any new positive cases thank you very much marla um nestor can you talk about whether there are any um and leslie you may have it and something to say about this too um any any guidance about outpatient treatment of patients who have code 19 any new guidance right no i i don't think we have any any changes i mean the only the two only available drugs that have been sort of recommended and based on good evidence again are rendezvous and dexamethasone rendezvous is ib and is usually a minister in the hospital the methodism is recommended for patients who have severe disease and are uh you know further than seven days into the symptoms so these are like inpatient medication the outpatient remains the same paracetamol or acetaminophen to control the symptoms you know well you know hydration monitoring of the of the oxygen saturation if possible but no specific therapy for outpatient that i know of i've seen recommended on some of the groups i'm on on um uh people talking about budestonite inhalers um have you seen anything i haven't found any data on it but people are convinced it works right there was a doctor from texas i think that was on tv and was telling that that it worked but it was his personal experience i know there's a story of inhale there are a couple of studies of inhaled steroids last time i checked in clinicaltrial.gov but they haven't been published so we don't we don't know uh if if they're going to be useful or not obviously we're awaiting those those results but nothing nothing has been published not has it been incorporated in in any of the guidelines that i check which i usually check the cdc nih island the idsa guidelines and also um acp guidance and and haven't seen anything or in the unwa show also thank you i'm jeff jeffrey miller i'm going to ask you to mute yourself and ask your questions because it's an interesting question but go get your go ahead that would be great you're still muted [Music] sure my question is masks are required in public spaces i mean as evidenced even here on our echo platform many people we close our door take off our mask um any uh and you know presumably that with a sense of safety that it's not being spread through the air flow system um i recall that one study i think it was from south korea in the restaurant of spread but is there any other research or sense of safety that we're being just fine doing what we're doing with the taking our masks off with our door closed in our private office yeah that's a great question and i'm going to try to address it because i i mean i thought of that myself in several occasions where i think first of all there is at least experimental evidence that that when we talk there are some aerosols and and those aerosols may remain in the air and there's also evidence that in in aerosols at least um viable virus are present for up to three hours so so there's these you know at least theoretical uh consideration that make transmission possible i saw a story i i'm trying to remember which part of the u.s but it was a u.s study of the of the air conditioning they actually went to the to the you know the large air conditioner in a hospital system and they were able to find pcr of the virus in some parts of the of the machine of the the machine that actually uh move the air within the hospital but those those are you know facts but but the other the other set of facts is it's the the secondary attack rate of these diseases and we have mentioned this before when they looked at outbreaks in china uh and and korea has just published their story on on secondary attack rates and the the attack rate at homes uh goes from 12 to the maximum that i've seen is 40 so when you think about it if you live in the same household of another covey patient and it's not eighty percent or ninety percent secondary infection rate although these theoretically trans uh aerosol transmission exists uh probably in the practical sense is not too high so so going back to specifically to your question you know if you know if if my uh aerosol goes into the air and and it's probably distributed throughout the hospital probably the concentration is not enough to affect other people in general because we have seen already much more um outbreaks like that so although there is a theoretical concern i think the practical reality is that it's an uncommon event and we have seen it with the super spreader we've seen it with the choir uh but it's not some thing that happens all the time still the close person to person for long exposure seems to be winning uh in the in the sense of transmission thank you thank you nestor um there's a question in the chat about um i don't know sarah if you want to ask this question sarah you but it's about there's somebody in some physician in texas promoting pulmonary court nebulization as preventative treatment for covid um can you talk about that nestor you're shaking yeah that's what what i just mentioned um i think somebody sent me the clip the video clip and i listened to part of it and yeah he he claims that he has treated all his patients and he has a very high q rate but it's not a published story it's just like his personal uh experience and and um i even remember that in the interview he used the word silver bullet which i that makes me question that because i mean i hope we could find a silver bullet for this the rendezvous is not a single ruler like samantha zone only increases like percent the survival uh so you know what we'll see we'll have to wait for the control studies to see the inhaled steroids make a difference especially for the inflammatory manifestations in the lungs thank you i have a question i've been recommending people quit smoking does that actually make a difference in the short term or is it you know sort of one of those they'd have to quit smoking in 2018 in order to help thank you leslie um there's a couple of other actually i guess had a bunch of questions about testing and some of it we may need to try to get our colleagues back from tri-core particularly about antibody testing but is there any new information related to antibody testing and how reliable it is and basically how it's currently being used no i really have no no new information to be honest with you nor have i seen any any like um publication that changed what we know about it the only thing i made this comment a couple of weeks ago is the fact that that we are learning that the longer you wait to do the antibodies also they they tend to go down so there was uh asymptomatic and one of the story that that i review asymptomatic patient lose their antibody in that story up to 40 uh after after eight weeks so so you know it has some limitation because of that sensitivity initially and and then later because the the antibody levels weighing or go down thank you mister and there's also a question about batching this seems to come up every week as well i don't know marley you might want to talk about this is there any just especially because of the you know decreased decreased testing availability basically is there any any role for antibody testing now in new mexico i mean educational for batch testing increased report batch testing yeah none of the labs in new mexico that i'm aware of are doing this pooled testing yet fda did release an emergency use authorization and some guidance around pool testing a couple of weeks ago but it's not something that's happening in new mexico at this point that i'm aware of you're muted carla i'm sorry you're muted thank you nestor um there was a there was a question earlier about um whether we should be thinking about using tests that are rapid and less you know less sensitive but we could get more people tested um in general than using these tests that are now a little bit complicated and hard to get just maybe your thoughts about that nestor do you want to go first yes yeah i've seen a couple of publications uh when they use modeling and and rapid turnaround it's key more than the you know the few points up and down in the sensitivity of the testing i think more than one publication that they they make emphasis on on the importance of rapid turnaround for for action remember these diseases usually a tran start a transmission 48 hours before the patient is symptomatic if if he's ever symptomatic so if if um and then the the viral load really goes down and the excretion of wire goes down as soon as symptoms develop so we wait uh for the person to have symptoms number one and number two then we have to wait for the test result three four five days obviously when we get the result back it's not going to be that useful for for decision making it's getting it's like getting the the weather forecast three days after the storm came i mean it's it's probably not useful um in reality i heard this by by another physician on uh saying any and it's true so we need to get um you know tests which are reliable uh even if we sacrifice a little bit the sensitivity rapidly you know in less than three days so so we can actually you know place the person in isolation look for the contacts that may have had rapidly so we can contain the epidemic if it's after the fact is probably you know too late to intervene or somewhat paid to intervene thank you nestor marla did you have any other comments about that uh yeah my only comment is my understanding about some of the rapid testing platforms is that they also have resource constraints um in terms of the supplies needed to run those tests so i think if we tried to use them at the capacity um that we've been doing testing we would quickly run into the exact same problem that there you know was difficult to get a test to everyone who needed it i think the performance of the rapid test there's a question about how well they perform in asymptomatic people the emergency use authorization was really um to be used for people who were symptomatic or there was a high clinical suspicion of a covid19 infection so i think using them for sort of population you know level um surveillance testing um you know might not have as much utility but i it's a hard balance you know we we don't have the testing availability that we would like or that we need or the turnaround times we need right now um so i think um you know everything has to be on the table um and using the resources that are available to people um you know for their best and highest use and those are you know individual decisions i think as much as there are larger policy decisions thank you marla leslie do you want to admit yourself and ask your question so with the recent studies showing that even patients who you know had known covid that their antibody levels dropped so quickly the antibody studies we're doing i'm assuming that there's a fair number of people who are testing negative who probably actually did have it and i'm just wondering does that mean that maybe there's a larger percentage of the population is potentially immune yeah i think that that is that is to a certain degree through uh uh if you if you wait too long to do the server logic testing it may be be negative in a percentage of the population that goes from 13 in the symptomatic to 40 as i mentioned in in that particular study that i presented and and people are thinking about measuring cell immunity because cell immunity the memory t cells um do last basically for the for the life of the cells and sometimes really long um long long time so so probably in the future we're going to measure antibodies and somehow we're going to try to to also measure uh in cell immunity like we do with tuberculosis with tuberculosis you don't produce antibodies to do astrological tests so you have to to test uh using the quantiferon or ellispot or some of those they actually measure the production of of interferon by t cells that have been uh that remember the antigens of tuberculosis so so we're probably going to move towards that i think at some point obviously if you do the serological testing right in you know after the acute disease a couple of weeks it's probably good because most of the population will have antibodies but if you have to do a cerebral and study let's say six months after a wave uh it's probably going to be it's going to underestimate the number of cases and you have to complement that with with cell immunity thank you nestor um there's been a couple of questions there's one on the pre-registration and one in the chat about the use of practical use of ultraviolet light in indoor situations um and but there was something i guess this morning about on npr about arrest reasoning and in a restaurant and also about using it in hospitals nestor do you have any no i i mean i haven't reviewed any publication i saw at the in the bbc that they use it at the heathrow airport they have a big robot that goes you know walking around the airport uh especially at night when there's no no people around they they disinfect the areas with with this ultraviolet robot but that's it's just uh you know watching the news thank you thank you very much um also i think deborah gru are you on i don't see you oh there you are you're right in front of me right in front of me did you want to ask your question um just about the data i was curious uh jenna asked a question about the data being sent to the where the data new mexico is is sent yeah thank you um um yeah i'm wondering what the changes in cdc reporting that i've read about in the news at our main hospitals are we still sending data to the cdc and to washington or have we has has there been any change in the pattern of reporting officially for our state marla go ahead thanks deborah uh yeah there was a change um i think people probably saw a lot of the reporting uh hhs stood up a new reporting platform and asked hospitals to start reporting data they had been providing to cdc through nhsn the national healthcare safety network asked them to you know stop using nhsn as their official reporting portal and start using this new hhs data collection tool there was an option um force um states to sort of take over as the designated reporter for hospitals um so that individual hospitals didn't have to report to hhs and and we did do that in new mexico we were able very quickly to adapt our em resources platform which many hospitals had already been reporting some fema required data into um for ppe we were able to adapt that to add the additional reporting questions that hhs was requiring and so hospitals still have that single point in em resources for the required reporting and then new mexico transmits that data to hhs so that individual hospitals don't have to do that across the state so we still are reporting that information as required by fema hhs hospitals can still report into nhsn as optional reporting if they'd like to so all of that is still going to both cdc and hhs and epidemiology and response division reports individual case data directly to cdc through our electronic surveillance system thank you marla um alan crowe was asking a question about the there's a study out of israel about using vitamin d um i don't know uh nestor do you do you know that study can you speak to that yes actually alan sent send me the link and i was able to sort of browse over the the paper yeah these these researchers in um in israel actually um you know look at the vitamin d levels in patients before they had coffee and they compared for those those who had copied with those who didn't have coffee then they actually found a lower not a large difference it was 19 versus 20 um difference in the levels of vitamin d but there was a significant difference in the in the level of of a statistically significant difference in the levels of vitamin d um so so according to this data it looks like another risk factor for for severe copies having low vitamin d and they tried to do a multivariate and a new barrier analysis to try to sort of separate um other other confounding factors and and it was still a statistically significant a low level of baseline vitamin d or pre-coping vitamin d and having a more severe severe disease vitamin d it's it's uh it's related to the to the response of the immune system it's like like many other uh vitamins and and and cofactors are are critical so so it's interesting i have i i think i have seen a publication but it was like three or four months ago out of china with similar similar findings so this is not the first uh association the clear association between low levels of vitamin d and a more severe kobe of course but this is a pre publication so we have to wait for it to be peer review uh before we actually um you know take it as a as a as a firm or robust piece of data but yeah it's interesting finding thank you alan for sending thank you nestor um lisa cutchen do you have audio do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question about cpap sure um so a patient um was asymptomatic he was tested for kobe because his wife had been exposed um the wife did not test positive but the husband and the daughter did the patient discontinued cpap use because he was positive and now the question is how soon can he resume use um and i what is a good period of time to wait before assuming that he is no longer shedding virus because he refuses to be retested yeah i think i mean i would just by analogy the the indication from cdc like uh you know at least 10 days after he had the initial test obviously he's asymptomatic so we cannot use the symptom base saying you know 24 hours without symptom which is the new the new time but i would i would say in general 10 days after he was tested would probably be a safe uh a safe period of time to wait until he can reuse the cpap because we know that most of the patients actually have a rapid decline in the in the upper respiratory viral excretion or respiratory viral excretion after after ten days um unless they are immunosuppressed or they have very severe diseases in which case you know we'll go a bit longer maybe 20 days as cdc recommends i don't know if if i'm if i'm right on the money or i made a mistake there thank you no you've got it right thank you thank you i just wanted to remind everybody that the cme link is just put into the chat a couple minutes ago if you don't see me for this session please um please fill that out and we would love to have your feedback uh about how to make this most effective for you um marla can you talk there was a pre-registration question just about the impact of covet 19 on our native american population particularly here in new mexico and on the navajo nation can you just talk um from the epidemiologic standpoint a little bit about what's been going on and if things are changing um i haven't looked at our most recent data um for um aian cases but early on um you know they that those two counties um where most of our native american population is made up um you know almost two-thirds of our total cases in new mexico and they continue to be disproportionately represented represented in our positive cases i apologize i don't have those most recent numbers right in front of me their case counts um have um you know have not grown at the same rate that we're seeing in other places in the state now but given that they were so impacted early on still make up a disproportionate number of cases in new mexico thank you marla um there is a couple of questions um there's another question about icu capacity i don't know if necessary looking about this just what's what's basically going on in new mexico on icu capacity and utilization and hospital occupancy yeah i i really don't know i know that we are i mean the latest number that i saw from unm it was that we were over 100 100 so we were still having you know issues and not because of copy but because of non-copied and copied uh patients we really have had a pretty full sensor to the point that there were patients in the ed in the emergency department waiting for a bed uh i think it has to do with the fact that people postpone all you know elective surgery postponed their medical problems um when we were in the lockdown and now they're coming to have their procedures and they're also coming because they they their diseases their underlying diseases are our control so to some degree i was on call last week and it was really busy uh and not not recovered with all type of infections and and underlying conditions so but but i don't know it's really statewide or or community-wide how the icus are doing marla did you have any other information about that i know that that information is updated once a week um again on the new mexico department of health website if you go to the modeling um subsite there's a weekly slide deck that includes hospitalization data so that's only updated um once a week but that information is available publicly thank you marla and i would i for those of you who don't know about it who are in new mexico on tuesdays from 12 10 to 12 40 davis grace gives an update from hsd um that you can sign up for it's actually really really interesting and a lot of these things a lot of these uh uh issues are discussed as well but he gives he shows he shows slides and gives an update sort of from from the state perspective so that's super helpful um there's another again marla sorry to ask you so many questions but can you just go over the strat the the guidance again from the cdc about when you can when people are considered to be non-infectious there's a couple questions about that on the pre-registration sure um so the guidance that um changed on the 17th i believe is when cdc released it um is that for people who are asymptomatic so we'll start with them at least 10 days have passed since the date of their positive test so that's the date of their specimen collection so if they've remained completely asymptomatic from the date of their test they're considered cleared 10 days after that test date and can discontinue isolation and go back to work for people who are symptomatic it's also at least 10 days have passed since the date of their positive test or their symptom onset they've had improvement in their symptoms and they've had at least 24 hours without a fever without re using fever reducing medications so that time frame is extended for symptomatic people who've had severe illness or people who are severely immunocompromised to at least 20 days since their symptom onset or the date of their positive test thank you um christian would you like to comment okay can you introduce yourself first and and comment about you had a couple comments yeah sure hi christian raymers from san diego california um just one comment that kind of brings together the idea of doing a less sensitive test more frequently as well as the idea of testing postcobid and i think some of this comes from a guy named michael mina who's at brigham and women's hospital in harvard and he's been very vocal about this that we are just wedded to pcr as our test of choice and it's probably a test that's too sensitive in this situation so a lot of the literature on post covid testing where people will be persistently positive for weeks and weeks and weeks the cycle threshold in the pcr is so high that you're detecting rna that's just completely non-infectious and in fact going back to some of the earlier studies the original nature paper from germany no positive viral cultures past day eight after symptom onset so and we haven't seen many secondary transmissions at all so california's actually um we're in a big testing crunch just like everybody else and they came out with a new version explicitly saying do not test people after they've already been positive in order to return to work it's a waste of resources and it's not going to tell us any useful information i'd say the one exception to that is special circumstances like immunocompromise a patient of mine for example with hiv who's in the middle of chemotherapy for esophageal cancer tested positive for covet and he needs to get back on chemo and they want him to be um pcr negative prior to slamming him with chemo that's an exception um but the idea that our pcr based testing is just too sensitive really fits with michael mina's idea that you could do a very very cheap amino assay that maybe loses a log or even two logs of sensitivity and if you could do it where somebody could test themselves by themselves once every day that if it's a dollar test that would be a really different paradigm and yet a lot of public health laboratorians are really not willing to get away from the pcr based paradigm that we're kind of locked into thank you very much christian um a couple of people have asked me in the chat about how the link to to get to davis grace's um thing i somehow i think i got it from the primary care association or the medical mexico medical society but i can find out if anybody on the network knows exactly how to get to that and for oh it looks like um mark epstein says yeah go to the new mexico medical society website and you can you can just sign up for them they're like i said they're actually they've actually been super helpful um and and there he just gives a short update about what's going on in new mexico so we just have a couple of minutes left um nestor any other burning um information you want to share with anybody with everybody no i have nothing i just want to thank everybody for joining like like every week and we'll keep keep track of this kobe 19 and remember that that you know we may be tired of the virus but the virus is not tired of us so we have to keep our guard up thank you nestor i just wanted to remind everybody please fill out the cme um cme evaluation if you if you can and um our next session is next monday on august 3rd from 12 to 1. there are a couple of questions in the pre-registration about sessions available in spanish and we happen to have them so on mondays from 9 to 10 um nestor does a uh an echo right now and we're actually going to be starting one that's going to be thursdays from 4 to five um starting in the after august 13th so those are all done completely in spanish the one on thursdays will be pretty much just like this and this is sort of office hours format the one on mondays is more a little bit more formal and there's a presentation to um given like a 20 15 to 20 minute presentation on a specific topic but you can find out about all of those things on our website so please um check that out if you're interested in going to these in spanish i also wanted to remind everybody that there's no critical care echo on on this thursday um that's just a break we're starting back up in august but there's um no other no critical care echo this week um any anything else from any of our hub anything leslie or chris or marla or christian i don't have anything okay all right well thank you very much for joining and we will see everybody next week can we uh start the breakout session please for the uh team sure i think so doctor nestor left because i can't see him right yeah he usually has to get off right afterwards yeah so i'm opening the room for four four people yes you,,7/27/2020
14,office hours nice to see everybody um i'm carla thornton infectious diseases physician here at unm i'm one of the associate directors of project echo i'm happy to be here today and um i just have a couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started with the session as you all know um and guitar to me saying this over and over again but we love to see your faces so if you have a camera please turn it on we'd like to see you in person we understand if you don't have a camera that's totally fine but if you have one we'd love to see you um we'll uh we'd like for you to use the chat box just to just for questions only if possible um we would ask you to refrain from answering those questions in the chat box unless you're one of the hub team members um and also just ask that you keep yourself muted during the session unless you're called on by one of the facilitators uh our digital librarian kent is is putting um resources into the chat box constantly during the session so please pay attention to that and if you would like to access any of the those articles that dr sosa mentions them we'll um you can do that through the chat box as well so i'm going to without further ado get going and i will have um dr sosa introduce himself and then we'll go to the other people who are on who are also members of the hub marla and i'm not sure if leslie's on but we'll go to her as well and have them give any updates as well but nestor would you like to go ahead and get started with your updates yes thank you thank you carla hi everyone um i'm nestor sosa i'm the infection this is division chief here at unm i'm going to try to share my screen in one second okay can you all see it good okay all right so let's do the update i review as usual um you know the literature the most important journal to see what was published and that i thought it was relevant or or or meaningful um so we're going to talk a little bit about this i don't know if you heard in the news there's the the mnwr article on the summer camp in georgia who had an outbreak and also related to that and i think these two papers that these two initial papers are relevant for school closure and decision making for that about the viral loading upper respiratory track of young children um then uh there there was a paper in i think one of the gem up one of the jama journals about uh cardiac disease in post-copy which i think is interesting we have been discussing like the postcovet syndrome and and some of the things that happen after you recover from the acute phase of kobe so i thought it was really interesting uh this study that i'm going to show finally there was a really in-depth analysis of the modern vaccine in in in monkeys in macaques and they did some measurements of the immune systems i think it's interesting although it's in it's an animal model but it's uh it's really interesting and very relevant to to humans also and finally the association as a paper dedicated for the association between obesity and kobe 19 that found some interesting findings so that's what i'm gonna talk about today so the first was this interesting uh publication the morbidia mortality weekly report of the cdc in which they they actually describe on what i think it's an extraordinary outbreak of kobe 19 in a summer camp uh this is this is a summer camp that took place in in georgia and staff trainees and campers actually were affected and despite the fact that they follow many of the recommendations of the of the cdc they actually tested people before going into the camp they requested a negative test in the 12 days within 12 days of assisting the camp uh they did some efforts to cohort the participants or the the the campers in in the different cabins they they allow less than 26 per calvin so they reduced the number um and the mean was 15 individuals per calvin they they did some staggering of the activities in the communal spaces they tried or at least said that they were keeping physical distancing and enhancing uh cl cleaning and disinfection the median age of the of the of the participants in this camp was 12 years but the range obviously was from 40 i'm sorry from from 4 to 59 the the things that they did not implemented which is uh probably very relevant they were not using clothes masks they didn't open the windows of the cabin so so it was sort of a closed uh environment especially at night and there was a lot of obviously shearing singing and chanting uh during the the activity which we know from other outbreaks that increases transmission um these are the the the table describe the participants 597 so almost 6 600 participants in this camp they were able to test 260 so the attack rate of this outbreak was 44 but in reality they only tested 360 so i'm sorry 340 participants of the so of out of all of those tested 76 percent were puffies there were many that were not tested that went home and were not really tested but the overall attack rate was 44 but if you if you look at only those who were tested it was as high as 76 percent and you can see the ages and the different um distributions so so it was really an amazing amazing outbreak as i said 260 or 344 were positive and and you know the conclusion that we can we can derive from these outbreak is that really kobe 19 even in young healthy um uh individuals can be very very contagious i mean 76 out of out of three you know 344 is a very high number with the caveat that they were not using masks so who knows if they would have been using mask um who knows how how much [Music] protection it would have confer under these circumstances but obviously without a mask it was close to 80 percent of the of those tested tested positive so so very interesting another another study that is somewhat related to this it's actually um from a hospital in chicago in which they actually measured the viral load of of the of uh 145 persons and they had 46 young children 51 older children and 48 adults in this in this cohort and they actually use the the cycle threshold of the pcr as a surrogate marker for for buyer load the smaller the ct the faster the the test becomes positive the higher the the wire load they they use bilateral mp swap for this study so so they were they had a almost equal representation of small children older children and adults and and the main conclusion of this study and remember the smaller the city the the greater the buyer load was that children less than five years uh had a higher viral load than all of the other ages 5 to 17 and adults 18 and and over um so contrary to what what we have been telling that you know children are not the drivers of the epidemic you know it's true still that they don't get a severe disease i think the fact that they have a very high vital load at least in this relatively small study it's it's somewhat worrisome and that put together with the with the you know large outbreak in a summer camp where kids were also involved makes you think about you know opening school and some of the some of the things that may or may not happen um with that so so you see here actually the the the wire low was actually higher meaning that the city was lower meaning that the high the wire low was higher in this group less than five compared to five to 17 and 18 which was basically identical so really kids have more virus in there and they said according to the to the measurement that they did it was equivalent to between 10 and 100 full higher wire loading their in their mp or nasopharyngeal mucosa really really interesting so so john childer may not be the drivers but definitely this finding of a higher buyer load it is definitely something um that should generate some debate and concern uh switching gears the other the other uh interesting paper was also published in in jama and this was um a group from from germany who actually look at a hundred unselected um patients or recover patients from kobe 19 they actually follow them and study them after the acute disease 52 were males the median age was 49 and the interesting thing they did uh cardiac magnetic restaurant so they did imaging of the heart of these subjects and they measured also the troponin t which is a marker for for myocardial damage and they found that 78 of these unselected these were not cardio patients this was just any anybody who they decided to test uh consecutively that recovered from kobe so they found 78 had a normal cardiac magnetic resonances meaning either you know low ventricular ejection fraction inflammation of the pericardium some type of abnormality in the in the heart and 71 had a um an elevated troponin t which is a surrogate marker for for myocardial inflammation myocardial damage obviously we use it in myocardial infarction and they uh they also show in this in this in this graph uh the presence of both uh lymphocytic infiltrate in the heart of one of the patients that had an endomyocardial biopsy in these in this cohort and also the the presence of of you know of inflammation in the in the heart so so you know we are sort of completing the the story and these are the measurements of uh on top of the findings in the in this cohort of patients those who recover at home those who recover in the hospital had more abnormalities in the t1 which is one of the modalities of the of the mri and the same thing compared to healthy controls and to match controls or or or severity controlled non-copy patients so there was definitely more frequent findings or abnormalities in this in the mris of patients with kobe than in the general population or even age and severity match controls and these are the levels of troponin tea as you can you can see the levels are higher in general in those who had copied either at home or in the hospital than the controls that they use in the in this population so so apparently and that was the conclusion they found a very high incidence of abnormalities but we don't know really it's the clinical significance of these findings i mean this is going to translate into into some type of you know cardiac failure or some type of chronic cardiac disease in this patient we really don't know we don't know the long-term prognosis of these findings these were done uh a few days or weeks after the acute infection but it's a nevertheless you know another interesting and somewhat worrisome finding that that an organ like that is not the lung seems to be also affected in in this new uh viral infection the the next paper that i'd like to just call your attention it this is an animal story paper but it's interesting because it was really it was an analysis of 12 macaque monkeys vaccinated with two doses of the modern vaccine one of the most uh advanced vaccine that we have that is actually going into phase three or started actually phase three last week in humans but they they took these monkeys and they actually did really in-depth pathologic studies biologic studies immunologic studies and they found obviously that that especially the high dose the 100 micrograms generated very high levels of antibody and you can see these especially after the second vaccination they actually use two doses one initial dose and a second those uh two two weeks later and you can see that the levels of most of the patients in red that receive man sorry most of the most of the monkeys i'm sorry that received the second dose of the vaccine at the higher those are very high levels of antibodies which are actually higher than what is suspected for natural infection and and also the neutralizing antibody was level were also very high in those who received the higher dose the second i mean the two to two doses of the higher uh level of of rna so that was important and that has already been shown in humans the other important aspect is the the the cell immunity they were able to prove that those who receive the higher those also develop a th1 a t cell um response so they do have cellular or this vaccine also generated cellular immunity and the good thing is that it generated the good cellular immunity which is th1 as opposed to th2 th2 actually has been associated with with something called vaccine associated respiratory disease which is a is it's a it's actually something negative it's like an inflammation that occurs especially have been seen with measles and and rsb um respiratory institute of virus vaccination in the past or in clinical studies so it's good that this vaccine did not generate any th2 um reactions you can see basically the they are identical to the control to the to the phosphate buffer serum that they use as control vaccination so so this is another piece of good news good cellular immunity and and the cellular immunity seems to be um of of a favorable um pattern the th1 over th2 and and finally um these these monkeys were actually re-challenged with with the virus and and and you can see the the the high dose i mean the controls the low dose and the high dose they were obviously protected there was very little virus in this in both um in the bal fluid very little virus as as if you compare with those monkeys that did not receive the vaccine so it's not only generating um protection in in the markers but it's also protecting them from a re-challenge with the with the virus so especially the high dose was was protected both in the lungs and in the in the upper respiratory tract so so those i thought it were reassuring um findings about this this vaccine which is actually the one of the most this and the one from uh university of oxford are the ones that are more advanced and where the world are histologic but i'm going to skip this in the sake of time and the final story that i want to comment was also interesting these these investigators actually did a retrospective cohort studies of sars patient and they actually concentrated on on obesity to see uh if they can predict how obesity um affected uh the severity of disease and they actually found and this this this graph uh summarizes the the study that the higher your your body mass index the higher the hassle ratio of death or intubation there was so there was a clear um relationship between higher body mass index and higher degree of or percentage of complication and we knew that but the the surprising finding was that this was only applicable to those less than 65 so so especially younger younger patients with obesity tend to have a higher risk of severity as opposed to older older patients who have other comorbidities so that was interesting they couldn't find an association between obesity and inflammatory markers because as you know there are several hypotheses how obesity can affect and the authors actually speculate on on the possible explanation for this association between between obesity and and kobe 19 one of the hypothesis is that in general and we know this from from studies in cardiovascular disease adipose tissue um leads to an expansion um i'm sorry adipose tissue expansion leads to an immune activation and inflammation also obese individuals do have more comorbid conditions like diabetes hypertension adipose tissues produces also complement factors and these complement factors uh have been implicated in the in small vessel thrombosis and we know from from other studies along with kobe 19 that patients with severe cavity do have an activation of the of the population and do have like microscopic thrombosis uh in the in when they do the autopsies and finally just the mechanical fact that abdominal obesity may impair diaphragmatic extortion producing hypo hypoxemia atelectasis and something so so you know they did find an association obviously between obesity and some of the some of the underlying diseases so they found that obese patients had a higher incidence of cancer um hypertension but significantly different were pulmonary disease and diabetes so there was an association between not only obesity and severity of copy but also obesity and having comorbidities at the same time so i think i mean what we can we can conclude from this study and it basically reinforces what we know that you know obese individuals should consider themselves vulnerable disease and they should definitely wear a mask and try to maximize social distancing and also try to obviously lose weight um and and engage in regular exercise to to decrease the the body mass index and those in in theory decrease the risk of kobe that that's my update for today thank you thank you very much nestor um i think i'm gonna go ahead and move to marla can you introduce yourself marla and if you have any updates to give that would be great thank you carla hi i'm marla sievers i'm an infectious disease epidemiologist with the new mexico department of health um and i think my only update today is i know we talked last week you know that we had sort of seen a record-setting pace of new cases being identified each day in the state and um over the last few days we have now dipped below 300 new cases a day so um you know the pace of new cases seems to be slowing which we are heartened by um and the other update is uh there was a press conference last week and uh the governor did extend the existing public health order through the end of august so all of the restrictions on indoor dining and and group size and the other things that were put into place at the beginning of july are still in place through the end of august and then that will be reevaluated based upon what's happening in the state with cases and last week someone asked a question about native american cases i didn't have the numbers right in front of me so i wanted to share this week according to the latest data on our dashboard native american cases make up a little over 36 percent of our total cases in new mexico and again it's a very disproportionate impact uh given that the native american population is less than ten percent of our state so that's the latest information group thank you so much marla um leslie hayes or i i believe you're on now updates from a primary care perspective and can you introduce i don't have any let's say family physician espanola i don't have any updates this week great thank you very much so i'm just going to ask a couple questions um [Music] about some of the escape or actually i'm going to ask carrie i see him sitting there in front of me um if he went go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question about the myocardium lymphocytic infiltrates yeah dr sosa you're uh study the gemma study on the mri patients uh post-hospitalization talked about the lymphocytic infiltrates but i was just wondering if there was any detection of microvascular thrombosis in any of those patients that were studied and got mri no i didn't see any anything to that in the in the heart i've seen it in other autopsy series um anywhere else i mean there's this generalized endothelies or inflammation of the endothelium with with associated thrombosis but i don't remember seeing in the in this particular um case series they did i think very few endomyocardia biopsies they don't need they don't do it to all the 100 members of the cohort but but i don't remember seeing that in the paper thank you very much and heather brisley asked a great question that you can discuss nestor has anyone looked at cardiac involvement from other significant viral illnesses like influenza and other respiratory viruses no we know for a fact that there are viral myocarditis and especially coxsackie and some of the enteroviruses can produce myocarditis after after an acute infection and there are some obviously respiratory viruses that can also produce endocarditis i'm sorry myocarditis and other another cardiac complications but um i think this this high percentage 78 if this is actually validated by other researchers is very high i mean having abnormalities my hope is that this is all transient that this is that hopefully will be something that will go go back to normal um but but it's it's it's nevertheless it's worrisome the authors you know get out of the way to explain that these were not selected patients said oh yeah these are patients referred to a cardiologist in germany and you know if you refer to a cardiologist because something was wrong with you they said that it was not that it was actually a consecutive 100 consecutive patients not selective by by any means with any actual they actually excluded those who were referred for cardiac disease so these were a patient who who did not have any suspicion of cardiac disease until they got the the the mr and the troponin levels so it was it was really interesting but yeah it's been described with other viruses um myocardial in especially enteroviruses and to some degree influenza and other respiratory viruses thank you nestor and one other um uh dr seibold put in another uh question from the chat in the beginning i think you've asked a couple of times about full testing and unfortunately we don't have our tri-core people on today but i don't know if marla few um he's dr seibel's asking about pull testing and is it widely available um what are the roadblocks which test is available for pull testing and what are the limitations and i guess the question again is are we using it at all in new mexico marla can you yeah all great questions i wish we had someone from the lab on who could talk about it more um we're not using it anywhere in new mexico yet that i'm aware of and um you know i'm not an expert enough on the process in the lab to know sort of what goes into that and um you know what needs to happen to to make that available um you know fda did um release an emergency use authorization a couple of weeks ago now um talking about the circumstances under which pooled testing was authorized and the number of samples that could be pooled but i don't have any new information beyond that thank you marla um so i think i'm gonna move to the the pre-registration questions there weren't a ton of pre-requisition questions today so please if you have any questions for anyone on the network put them into the chat and we'll get to them today for sure um there was a question from elena benjamin and taos given what we know about covet transmission what do you recommend for ppe in the outpatient setting with asymptomatic patients i don't know if either uh go ahead nestor yeah i think i mean still we are unless you're going to do something that is aerosol generating the recommendation um the dominant recommendation is to use um a surgical or procedure mask um with the patient um we are not and we are not using it here in you at unm unless you are you know doing uh you know like an endothelial integration or or bronchoscopy or some other some other aerosol generating uh procedure we're not using n95 but using just um you know contact and droplet precautions essentially i don't know if that have changed i know there's a lot of pressure i'm going to be really honest with this there's a lot of pressure in the literature of people um highlighting the importance of aerosol transmission and and longer distance transmission especially in close rooms and and they have described these super spreader events in in churches and in other close settings like the restaurant in china uh so there is a concern for aerosol transmission but i think the dominant um prevention is still the the surgical or procedure mask to treat the patients and and only if you're going to do something that that generates aerosols the patient is scuffing a lot or you're going to do like nebulization or something that is really more risky then you should wear the the the a95 and place the patient in a negative pressure room etc ideally i don't know if marla you want to complement what i just said yeah i would just add for droplet precautions um eye protection is also recommended so either goggles or a face shield yeah thank you and that that just changed i think to a week ago or so unm as well for um face shield or i got i i protection thank you very much um let's see there's a couple of other questions or we i think we got leslie's question there um what are the this is a a hard question that i don't know anyone else the answer to but what are the recommendations for surveillance testing as students return to campus in increasing numbers and this is from craig tim one of our colleagues here in albuquerque um i don't i know that there's not any um accepted uh strategy yet but i don't know if either nestor marley you want to talk about that yeah let me yeah i've been i've been participating in the in a committee here at um trying to sort of discuss that issue and and there are many factors in fact in the jama there was a paper uh about testing and frequency of testing of of college student what's a moderate mathematical model on when you need to do it but i don't think that the yuri has come up with for a single answer it depends on the size of the of the university um it depends on the activities of the students like student athletes and other may need to require like uh periodic testing it also depends on your resources if you have the the means and the money and the the reagents and and the swaps and everything you can you can implement sort of a surveillance in other cases if you're a small college you don't have the funds uh then you have to just go with all traditional this is surveillance and in in and trying to increase your your general prevention and hygienic measures more than than frequent testing so it's very very difficult to to come up with like a single uh solution for all situations it's really very hard and we as i said in unm we have been discussing analyzing different uh probable strategies to to to decrease the number of cases on campus thank you nestor marla did you have any other comments uh no i didn't really have anything to add there's not a lot of clear guidance about it and you know as nestor said so much goes into a decision you know i think sort of at this point the best guidance we have is um you know universal um masking for source control all of the you know routine infection control and disinfection measures social distancing um and making sure that symptomatic cases are tested and identified early so that they can be isolated and contact tracing can occur i think that's sort of the best guidance we have right now great thank you very much there are a couple of questions in the chat um let's see one question about is the um is the shield adequate eye protection or does one require a full a td shield adequate eye protection or does one require a full face shield no i don't know i haven't really seen any paper like comparing one to the other um one thing is if you need the mask below the that's important because they're the people that i just said oh yeah i'm going to go out with a with a facial and that's enough it's really not enough the the opening of the face shield either tidy or the other one is too big uh and you you still have your mouth and your nose on cover so um but aside from that i i really don't know if there is any any solid evidence that that the longer shields are better than just the the eye protection thank you um dan saltman asked a question in the chat or anything more known about the different types of um sars kobe ii is the g type more virulent yeah what i have read um it's that it's because of the change in the in the s protein seems to be more infectious not necessarily more severe clinically there was also a publication i'm trying to remember where i read it to help the the the our group here put in the the the citations but um about about the different presentation there have been like the use of of an app and people are asked what type of symptoms they have and they there seems to be like a different grouping of symptoms people who have just like open respiratory or there's lower respiratory or the gi and they're trying to see if they are different clinical presentations and you can associate those presentations with prognosis but i don't think they have been clear a clear association between viral type and severity to um up to this point i haven't seen anything at least not in the big journals thank you nestor um regarding the georgia summer camp that you talked about earlier in your presentation did the article comment on prevalence and severity of symptoms among the campers who tested positive yeah i think if i remember correctly i'm afraid that i may but it was a high percentage of symptomatic i think it was 67 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic among those who tested positive but there's always a there's always a bias towards doing more testing symptomatic patients because they they actually get sick and then they get tested if they came from the camp so so there's there's not the caveat with that thank you nestor um joanna um katzman i don't see you on my screen but i think you're there if you could can you introduce yourself and you're going to move to you for the q for more questions sure um yeah joanna katzman here hi carl i'm one of carla's colleagues and welcome everybody and i i'm sorry i joined in late dr sosa i think uh nestor you talked probably in the georgia summer camp about the fact that the it was the counselors only my understanding they were wearing masks and not the kids um is that right yeah i heard that in a actually in an interview on tv but i couldn't find it very clearly in the in the paper yeah so i i yeah i'm not sure if that was true but i heard somebody mentioned that on on one of the interviews um but but actually i didn't see that and actually the attack rate was very high among the staff among everybody you know staff students trainees because they they had like a pre-camp uh session to train the the the helpers and then they had the main camp and and um and there was you know a significant attack rate all over the camp it was really amazing that type of of general and it was one kid that initiated or they have an initial case and then when they started testing they found a lot of people with symptoms and and positive testing interesting right in the backyard of the cdc too okay oh thanks nestor um thanks carla for all your amazing facilitation too um i'm gonna um there's a question here from k burke um and she wants to know um about any about any information related to the two top uh two vaccine trials i think she's um reiter talking about moderna and the oxford vaccines and if there are any adverse effects so far seen and are they only seen with the highest doses and are there being any challenge trials being done with them at all nestor yeah first of all the side effects yes there have been um they have been definitely side effects especially with the second injection um a lot of systemic um like fever malaise fatigue and also local symptoms pain in the arm soreness in the area of injection so that was documented and it was really you know very prevalent i mean probably to the level of like the soster vaccine or or or the the prevalent vaccine had a lot of local reactor genicity but the the authors of the of the both thought said that there was there were no like serious adverse events so nobody was like admitted to an icu or had a real life threatening situation just being really uncomfortable with uh with symptoms and in fact i think they're recommending uh the use of acetaminophen sort of prophylactically going forward so so p so you can minimize or try to minimize the the the symptoms that are associated especially with the second the second dose of the vaccine that you are already immunized and you have sort of a more a more robust reaction with both vaccines but i haven't i haven't seen anything beyond that in the publication but again um a warning here these are you know just dozens of patients not thousands of patients that have been injected we have to wait for the for the phase 3 which includes 30 000 and then we'll probably see some um less frequent but but probable uh you know more serious adverse event like jamboree maybe or one of the other things that have been sometimes associated with mass vaccination but hopefully it will be in a very very low number and and we can go ahead and continue with these vaccines forward oh thanks nestor um what about any challenge trials being done are you aware of that no i have seen the discussions the ethical discussions online and and in different podcasts and things but i'm not aware of any any challenge uh definitely not public publications on that uh they may be starting some that i'm not aware of but again the the challenge it's interesting because um you know it's a quick way to see the efficacy but with this disease with all the post-copy things with the mortality including young patients it's hard to to do a challenge a challenge trial um and actually now that we are talking about vaccine there's a there's a registry um yeah i think it's called vaccine prevention network a registry that is starting here in the united states for anybody who wants to volunteer to for one of the for one of the phase three trials i actually sign into one of those uh to be a volunteer um i don't know if they're going to do it in new mexico but if if they need more subjects you just you can go to the i think it's it's a vpn it's it's called the site vaccine prevention network and you you give your name and a few other information about your you know underlying conditions etc and you may or may not be selected to participate in one of these trials obviously healthcare workers are are at higher risk than general population so it's good that we that we participate because they can actually evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in people who are higher risk than people who are like lower risk and they're in their homes and they're not exposed to the virus you're not able to prove efficacy with that type of of populations from uh wanted to that's very very helpful your information there was a a question from carol morgan um or actually i first wanted to go to mary zeitner who was just talking about kind of airlines and some of the airlines are mostly airlines are now gone to full seating but there's a few uh that are hanging on to a little bit more distancing i think southwest and united or southwestern and delta and she wants to know how much difference does it make on the airlines who leave the middle seat empty or who who are trying to do a little bit of you know distancing what are your thoughts on that yeah no i don't know i mean too much i mean there hasn't been specific studies on that they have been on other diseases like like tuberculosis and other um so i i don't really know i i don't really know i mean if you ask me uh if i want to have a person with kobe who's like coughing or sneezing right next to me i would probably say you know if you can see that one chair and one seat away from me it would probably be better but it's not based on any solid data it's just like my humanity coming up really thanks nestor um and and carol morgan um i wonder if you could unmute um when you might be able to unmute this might be a question for um marla seavers hi marla i had a call from a owner of a local furniture store and she says a man comes in there at least once a week and he has a note from the doctor that says that he shouldn't wear a mask and that's due to um emphysema and other problems that he has with breathing and she's wondering what their liability is if he gets coveted by coming out into public and not wearing a mask is there anything the agency can do you know i think marla turned off her video marlo are you still there marla might have taken a a brief break and um nestor any comments on that we might come back when marla comes back to that question i think um for for for patients or persons who cannot use a mask um i mean i i don't work in the department of health but i would certainly look for like a note from their physicians that that in fact they they have like a medical contra indication because the problem is that many people who abuses that i said no i cannot wear a mask because i i don't tolerate the mass but i think in a case like this in an epidemic i think uh the ideal situation would be to actually have a medically uh justify and and in fact if somebody really needs to use the mass they can put the oxygen below the mask and the mask on top i have heard dr harkins our pulmonary expert described that there are patients who who can actually wear a mask as long as they use their oxygen underneath the mask um so but but i i don't know you know the legal aspects of that i don't really know so i cannot i cannot answer okay thank you and when marla comes back there's a couple other questions i think for marla too um joanna can i just comment real quick please i have only gotten one request so far for not wearing a mask but i recommend it for a couple other people as well that the letter i write is you know because of medical conditions this person cannot wear a mask because of this i recommend they do not go into stores they do not go into any indoor spaces um you know they need to make arrangements for delivery or to have stuff brought out you know i i don't give them carte blanche to go in i think we need to make it clear that if they can't wear a mask they need to not be interacting with people so thank you so much that is kind of what i said to her she needs to ask him to please restrict because he's going to get it right and he won't have any immunity to it thanks leslie that's terrifically helpful thanks carol for bringing that up um dr siebel did you have a question or want someone want to provide some input for us uh i'm not sure which of the i've put several things over in the chat which oh i wasn't sure if you roast your hands or wanted to say something oh um that was about yeah about a discussion that was going on so that's well passed now okay okay i'm going to move on to some of the pre-registration uh questions these relate to the kind of co-infection and underlying conditions um it's from monica brown martinez in las vegas new mexico wanting wanting to know about kind of the comorbidities related to borderline diabetes and control diabetes what is the thinking right now and also patients with controlled hypertension uh dr sosa what is it what are your thoughts right now in terms of risk uh and morbidity with covid with these two conditions those two conditions are listed and actually i would like to hear the the opinion of carla cause carla um i think was in a lecture today about about diabetes so that's going to be important but i know they are listed and and the way we the way this information has been gathered during the epidemic i don't think they have made a great difference between control and on control obviously it makes sense that if you have an uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrollable hypertension um you're sicker probably and you should have higher risk but most of the studies that i saw from china and europe they just listed hypertension in the medical history or diabetes they don't go into the detail how much the hemoglobin a1c was and they stratified that i know of um but i you know i would defer to carla if you want to make any comments most of the things that i've seen have been the presence or absence of this underlying disease as a risk factor and both of them hypertension and diabetes are associated with with a copy from the from the population study that they have done in the in the hot spots in in europe united states and and and also china thanks denzer please carla go ahead yeah thank you nestor yeah so i was um involved in help helping with the global echo this morning and it was about diabetes it was bob eckel who's the he's the head of the american diabetes association has a um he's really really good lecturer leslie just put into the chat um when the when the recording's available it's definitely worth watching if you have more questions about diabetes but he said a couple of really important things i mean he said that there's no evidence that people who have diabetes are more likely to get infection that that hasn't been shown but if they do get infection they are definitely more likely to have complications they're two to three times more likely to be hospitalized with serious infection and they're two to three times more likely to actually die from the infection and the other thing that if he showed really convincing data that the level of hyperglycemia is related to the risk of death and and severe disease really really really important and the other thing that he talked about which some of you have may have heard about was this that that coven 19 may be diabetogenic and actually cause diabetes and it's unclear a lot of people are getting um uh getting admitted with very very hyperglycemic what what looks like completely out of control diabetes and they were not known to be diabetic prior to that and they don't really know whether those um that dysregulation is going to last but they so they started an international registry actually looking at um people who have what looks like new onset diabetes if their diagnosis to follow those people so there seems like there's a really complex relationship with copenhagen and diabetes um but but again really excellent talk if you want to go on and listen to the recorded session from this morning absolutely and the end thanks carlo thanks nestor and wanted to let you know that many many mondays from 8 to 9 30 are when these global conversations are taking place and most of you on this um email list i think are getting um the emails for when they when they are happening with different topics uh usually each monday morning so thank you carla thanks nestor um another question now turning to more kind of exposure transmission immunity types of questions uh these are more kind of little case-based vignettes question from somebody in more on the east coast can someone returning from india safely quarantine in a home the 70 year old with high risk comorbidities this is more of a kind of a risk benefit type of question wanted to see how you might respond to that nester yeah that's that's a i mean it depends on the risk how much risk the person uh has and and and there was actually a comment by dr burks one of the persons in the one of the physicians in the in the copied uh white house called uh and they said that if if you have a person at home that is immuno suppressed or highly susceptible and you are in a hot spot let's say the person comes from a hot spot in india that should consider wearing a mask at home to protect that susceptible hose so i think with this kobe 19 um you you never you you never can exaggerate the the measures that you take uh for prevention especially if there are you know simple inexpensive common sense measures uh even you know without much evidence so so yeah i would say if i if if it were my mother and i know my mother has a underlying disease and and i'm going to be with her i probably will try to maximize my uh the protection that i confer to her if i have if i have been exposed until i'm sure i'm not infectious thanks nestor another question is a little bit of a little bit of a case vignette um should a four-year-old who was this is like a teacher kind of a getting ready for school situation should a family who has a four-year-old who was exposed to a teacher with confirmed um covid19 be quarantined i don't know how you easily quarantine the four-year-old um but uh this was a question and a hard situation i mean i i would love to for marla to be here to help me but i think i would say yes like any other exposed person uh that person if it's been a close exposure if it's been more than three minutes without them i asked the kids and without a master teacher without the teacher you need to consider the the kid exposed and you need to to follow the choir you know you know for 14 days until we consider him not infectious especially if we look at the the most recent papers that i mentioned the outbreak with the kids in georgia and the measurement of wireless and the mps i would definitely be concerned about these kids being able to transmit the disease yeah and they mentioned that um the child the four-year-old had a daily exposure with the teacher for a week yeah yeah and yeah definitely and if i if there is asymptomatic testing i would consider testing this kid if it's allowed in the state or they have the resources if it's been you know seven days since it's exposure to the teacher um i would even consider testing because if especially if they're like parents at home or something i would definitely at least raise the possibility of doing the testing to rule out the infection on this kid great great just wanted to remind everybody that cme link is now in the chat as of um about 12 40 44. and there's a question from pamela dafforn in the chat her question is is it reasonable to measure oxygen levels during during mat when a patient is masking or other face covering during use during an office visit to see if desaturation occurs that being said the letter i think regarding what carol and leslie hayes were talking about should instruct a patient who actually desaturates with the mass to avoid social gatherings or activities outside the home that seems uh reasonable thank you um i'm going to do one more question and then turn it back over to carla um there's been some talk nestor as you know about someone who's had the coven 19 infection developing antibodies and then the antibodies not lasting permanently or very long could you remark on that there was a question from maria martinez down in las cruces about how long do the antibodies last right i mean we are um actually my comments are based on few stories we're still learning and this is i think we haven't seen the last uh story regarding immunity and copy but what we know is that at least in a couple of studies that i have reviewed there's definitely a decay of the antibody levels that's that's to the point that asymptomatic patient in one of the study forty percent of the asymptomatic uh infected copy patient lost the antibodies after eight weeks so so as early as two or three months you may be several negative again if you had a mild disease with severe disease the immune response seemed to be more robust and seem to last longer from from the conclusions of that story that said really almost together with those studies there were also publications of cellular immunity there's evidence that uh even if you don't have antibodies um but you have been exposed to covet you you develop cellular immunity and cellular immunity is important because when you are re-challenged with the virus those t cells help the b cells produce antibodies so you may have sort of a booster effect and even if you don't have no measurable antibodies you may produce a new batch of antibodies because the t cells sort of activate the b cells and the b cells and plasma cells start producing antibodies again so i think we haven't seen the the whole the whole picture um my my uh reading of this is that yes some people lose their antibodies based on the evidence but i'm not sure that that means they completely lose their immunity but on the other hand we know that coronavirus immunity doesn't last forever so at some point people do lost significant protection because you can have more than one coronavirus from the endemic coronavirus you can have more than one time in your life a coronavirus infection so i think we we need to wait so you know but at least we have more clarity at the beginning at the beginning we know nothing about the immunity now we know that the majority of patients develop antibodies some people lose their antibodies but they they may have some underlying t-cell mediated immunity they can rescue them they are recharged at least in the immediate period after that said there have been isolated reports of re-infection still not in peer review but i i've seen interviews i heard poor podcasts or people say yeah i see patients that come you know for the second time and again with with kobe 19 we still have to wait a little bit more to get a more complete study of this patient we need to type the viruses to see if it's a re-infection or or actually just a reactivation that they never clear the virus i think there's still much to be studied thanks so much nestor back to you carla thank you mr um there's just another question sort of along the same lines of the immunity talking about immunity how long will the vaccine how long will vaccine volunteers be followed for antibodies and cellular cellular immunity i don't know i haven't seen the protocols of the phase three but usually i mean i've done vaccine studies and they follow patient for one or two years at least you try to do some you know long-term follow-up because you want to see how long does the immunity last but i really don't know how long these these uh specific trials are going to follow but in general we follow vaccine study follow patient for for up to two to two years thank you mr leslie do you want to ask your question yes a little bit earlier about masks about cloth masks sure so there was apparently a ucsf grand rounds where it was suggested that even though the mask is not going to completely protect you against covet it will decrease the viral load that you get and possibly give you a milder disease do you know if there's any actual data on that i mean it would certainly be lovely if that was the case right no i don't know i i was actually wondering that myself and that should the problem with the animal models is that they're not identical to humans but i guess it should be easy to do a like a macaque exposure you you infect macaques with like increasing levels of virus and see what happened to them but they do not develop a severe disease like human so that's a limitation it's very hard to do a you know a natural infection or a challenge in a human so that's why we don't know the the correlation between that it will have to be implied from retrospective studies of people who use mass or that who didn't use mass and see if they get a more severe disease but it's very difficult to do if you don't have a perfect animal model to actually calculate like a dose effect uh relationship do uh those effect relationship uh between those and and separative infection but i have seen comments um people you know talking about about uh that one indirect evidence is that healthcare workers um tend to have milder disease according to some of the sources that i have seen than the general public but that could also be that they are younger these are you know younger physicians or nurses who are working and they get mild disease but i think you can it's feasible to do uh like uh like a comparison do adjustment for age and severity of disease people who get the disease while there are words you've seen a mask have a less severe disease than those who get it in the community without a mask i think that's it's it's probably doable but it has to be done i haven't seen it thank you um another question in the chat about uh is there any does getting a bcg vaccination convert any immunity against covet right i haven't seen any any prospective study there have been some retrospective uh analysis and this applies to bcg and also mmr there are two vaccines that that people uh scientists speculate that if you uh if you get these these vaccines which are not related in any way to to covet biologically but you get sort of an immune response an innate immune response booster and then you are protected indirectly protected to to uh to kobe 19 these um uh this this type of conclusion come from several sources they have been observational studies in which after mmr vaccination kids get less uh frequent respiratory infections so there seems to be sort of a protection between getting the mmr and getting less respiratory infections and they thought it's it's that they are protected also the fact initially that we we observed that kids um had a less severe disease and people speculated well maybe because kids are getting vaccines all the time and those vaccines stimulate their immune system and that's what they are protected against kobe you know there's still no robust evidence to do that it's just a sort of a speculation and the same thing with bce at the beginning of the epidemic some um researchers speculated that countries with bcg vaccination had a lower incidence of of of kobe 19 but i think that's not holding anymore because we're seeing kobe everywhere i mean latin america is now a hot spot and and bcd vaccination is mandatory in many latin american countries so so i mean it is a thought it's a hypothesis but there's no solid evidence of that thank you nestor um marla there there's a question from nan saltman about has there been any literature any articles comparing different methods for contact tracing and is there a quote best practice for how to do this can you comment on that yeah i haven't seen anything that's sort of a head to head comparison um that looks at sort of passive contact tracing which is you know what they were able to do in singapore and south korea where they used uh cell phone data to identify people who were in close contacts uh with cases so rather than relying on a person to recall everywhere they might have been and who they might have been in contact with which i think you know any of us would admit would be very difficult if you ask me exactly where i was and what i did four days ago i would have a hard time telling you um so it makes sense that being able to use some of that passive data from people's cell phones or what they do in new zealand where when you enter a public place you scan a qr code with your phone and it kind of checks you into that location at that time and that information is used for contact tracing should it be needed i mean i think it makes sense that that's probably a much more efficient and um you know you get a lot better information using those technological means than you do just calling someone someone up and asking them to to have that recall and then supply you with contact information for people they know they might have been in you know been around i haven't seen like i said a study that kind of looks at that head-to-head but um i think if you look at um how those countries in particular have been able to um control the pandemic in their borders you can see that it's been quite effective thank you marlo that's super helpful and we just have a couple minutes but there's a great question by by jeffrey miller just asking about um you may have seen in the chat given that the northwest part of our state has improved significantly albeit with struggles is there anything we can learn from what our state citizens and the tribes have pursued in regards to social distancing like the curfews that were put into place and anything that that that the department of health is thinking about in that arena you know i think uh what it just reinforces is that limiting people's uh movement and their contact with others is a valuable intervention um you know the spread is person to person and so if you enact measures um you know stay-at-home orders business closures and curfews that reduce the amount of time people are spending uh moving geographically and spending time face-to-face those are probably besides universal masking some of our most effective prevention measures we have right now thank you so much marla so thanks to everyone today for joining we really appreciate we appreciate you coming and really appreciate our subject matter experts time nestor and marla and leslie and thank you so much for being here um again we'd love to for you to we'd love to get your feedback so if you fill out the cme survey please give us feedback about how to um what you think about the session and how to improve it our next session is on monday august 10th and um i believe joanna there's a critical care echo this week correct you're muted there's a critical career echo on thursday at um eight o'clock in the morning with michelle harkins and alicia perrotta talking about post covid follow-up in the ambulatory setting we also have a first responder echo uh today at two o'clock um if you're all interested in that we have a a really nice hub team with psychiatrists psychologists emergency room doctors about resiliency and on wednesday this week i believe at 12 noon we have our nursing home echo as well so we have a full plate thanks carla yeah thank you so much everyone there's been a lot of questions about postcode follow-up so the session on thursday might be really helpful for people thanks everyone for joining we'll see you next week thank you,,8/3/2020
15,co-facilitate this program with dr carla thornton except she's unable to be here today so it'll be me facilitating and um just wanted to let you know if you don't have your camera turned on but you have the ability to turn it on please do so it it it really is uh within the echo model for us to be able to see you and you to see us it really allows for optimal teaching i also wanted to let everybody know that um there will be a lot of information from our fantastic digital librarian kent noseworthy he'll be putting information into the chat today as dr sosa gives you um wonderful information and i see marla sivers on board and probably dr leslie hayes from espanola one of our expert primary care physicians and about 45 minutes after the hour we will post the cme link and even if you don't need um cme but you would like to provide us feedback please please fill that out it really really does help us we do look at that with a lot of deliberateness and with that i think i'll turn turn it over to dr sosa we've been loving his uh uh you know brief presentations followed by a lot of great questions and answers so dr sosa all right thank you joanna thank you very much hi everyone uh my name is nestor sosa i'm the infectious disease division chief and i'm gonna share my uh screen here in a second so we can go over some of the newest newest publications or or or newer uh articles on kobe 19. and today i'm going to put it in the way of questions what is the central prevalence of kobe 19 in healthcare workers in a place like new york city that was you know hit very hard uh in the beginning of the of the year or during the spring what are the risk factors for a positive test if you are a healthcare worker that's another question that one paper um sort of answered uh another interesting question is to do your your type of housing and income predicts your risk of calling 19 acquisition there was another paper from new york really very interesting i'll show you that what it showed and also an observation just one slide on on the something which strikes me a 46 decline in six types of cancer during the covet 19 epidemic is that a good thing and you you will see that it's probably not and then a study on nursing homes in massachusetts in which they did actually more than 30 000 pcr tests uh to the staff and residents of those nursing homes and we'll see what what it showed and finally we're going to go over some photos of dermatologic manifestations of kobe 19. so that's what i have prepared today let me advance the slide here so the first story was as i said the study of the of the cereal prevalence uh of star scoby ii in health care worker they they actually one of the health system the northwest hulker um in new york actually um did a pretty large uh cereal prevalence uh of uh in in they tested actually forty thousand over forty thousand uh healthcare workers and and they found a prevalence of thirteen point seven percent uh in in that group presumably a very high high-risk group in in a in a very uh hard-hit area like like new york city uh interestingly enough if you if you remember from one of our previous uh presentations the the community cereal prevalence in new york was around 14 so that was the first surprise and it's sort of a good surprise that the healthcare worker had exactly the same uh prevalence or zero prevalence as the as the general population so that speaks uh in favor of of you know of of uh good infection prevention and control in those in those hospitals obviously there were a couple of risk factors associated with with uh having a positive test one was obviously having a previous pcr positive um so or i'm sorry of having just a previous pcr performed because of suspicion of having kobe that um among those those patients who had a pcr before um thirty point thirty four point eight percent were positive so so the fact of uh uh of of of being um you know at high risk or or having a an exposure definitely puts you on risk of having a positive pcr and then later having a positive uh serological test surprisingly they look at other factors like the type of job in the in the healthcare system uh the location if they work in the emergency department or in intensive care or in the inpatient unit and none of those uh either job function or primary work location um or if they were involved with patient care or not none of those uh characteristics were associated with an increased risk the only two were the the ones that i mentioned having a previous pcr for whatever reason uh and most of the time was because they thought they they may have acquired coffee and number two uh having a high risk exposure or a self-reported suspicion of virus exposure to a high level those were the the only two um characteristics associated with uh with a positive uh serology so the conclusions of this relatively large study was that the cerro prevalence in healthcare worker was essentially identical to the population to the general population of new york uh surprisingly no difference if you were a nurse or a physician if you worked in the ed or emergency department or in the icu or in the general work world uh the risk was the same of to of having a positive sorority and and and definitely you know something that that it's worth if a healthcare worker tells you that that they have been exposed either in the community or in the healthcare setting uh that's a risk factor for a positive test so those those were the the conclusions of the author um the second uh story which is um it's not surprising but i think it's it's uh it's interesting and highlights the the issue that we have been talking in this and other echoes about the inequalities uh um poverty and other social determinants of health represent a risk factor but this this is a very elegant study in which they actually looked at at all of the pregnant uh patients that that delivered during the the kobe 19 epidemic in one of the hospitals in new york city and they have 434 residents from new york who went to this hospital to have their babies and they they have they all had pcr tests because they were doing routine pcr to all of the to all of the pregnant uh patients that were admitted uh into the hospital and they they uh they found found some some interesting associations between the socio-economic factors of these uh uh population and the risk for for acquisition of kobe 19 um and and it's what it's depicted in the in this graph and i'll guide you through the to the graphics they look complicated but they're really not so for instance if the the association with the number of units per building where they live if it was a a large uh building as opposed to a small or or single house the risk increases and the risk of having sars um with the with the with the number of residential units in the in the in the in the home uh it also increases with with the decrease in the in the neighborhood income if you live in a in a neighborhood that has a low lower income your risk of acquiring kobe was higher also it increased with the number of members per house so more than three you can see how it goes up as you have more people living in the same household um also the value of the of the house was also correlated with a higher if your house was um um less expensive or you live in a relatively inexpensive um unit or or apartment you you had a higher risk of being positive for kobe also the unemployment uh before the epidemic was also correlated so all of the all of these uh social economic markets were surprisingly uh correlated very well uh correlated with an increased risk of of acquiring uh coffee you know it makes sense but it's it's it's interesting to see it um in a more um you know in in a in a paper and and actually shown how poverty and inequality increases your risk of acquiring uh kobe 19. the other the other um paper that i found really interesting this these uh authors actually study the the changes in in newly diagnosed cancer and this is from one of the one of the labs one of the referral para labs for for cancer diagnosis they actually found that overall there was a 46.4 declining declining six types of cancer during the kobe 19 epidemic in in the nation so breast colorectal lung pancreatic and gastric cancer as you can see um decrease from the baseline before the epidemic uh and it went down uh through the month of march and april and obviously this is this is not good i mean this doesn't mean that the cancer um were actually declining it was the diagnosis of cancer was declining and and it's it's probably going to be associated with uh with more more advanced types of cancer presenting later in the year um once uh all of the health clinics open and we start seeing patients so it's sort of a worrisome more than more than more than a a good thing it's a bad thing that people were not seeking help uh for for cancer because we know that you know kobe doesn't doesn't diminish the incidence of of cancer in any way uh so it's more that people were not actually looking or or seeking help and diagnosis were not made on on their respective types of cancer the other interesting um uh study was a comparison of the viral levels in individual with and without symptoms in in nursing homes in massachusetts they actually this is a huge study with more than 32 000 residents and staff from nursing home and assisted living facilities in massachusetts they decided to test um with pcr all of these residents and staff to try to contain the epidemic and they actually ended up testing 16 almost 17 000 residents and 15 000 staff throughout the state um the mean age obviously of the residents was 82 the mean age of the staff much much younger 45 and what they found is that um they find that at some point the pcr was positive in 15.5 of the residents and 4.1 of the staff so so um so they you know they they they were able to to ascertain the prevalence or the point prevalence of this disease in the nursing home and more interesting was the correlation between symptoms and and and no symptoms they found that that um among the patients without symptoms residents have 12.7 positivity rate and the staff was 3.7 so a significant um you know number of residents were detected even without without symptoms of their disease and in fact uh among the positive among all of those who tested positive 70.8 were were without symptoms yeah among the residents and 92.4 among staff so so very high numbers but these were um patients without symptoms so it could be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic they didn't follow up these patients it was just a point uh testing in in a single point so they couldn't really ascertain if they were all really asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic but it's it's nevertheless uh interesting that they found this high percentage of asymptomatic even in nursing homes and the other the other interesting finding was that the viral load of those symptomatic and asymptomatic was essentially identical so so there was no no significant difference between the number of virus in the in the nasopharyngeal samples of those residents or staff with symptoms and those without symptoms that was that was kind of an interesting um finding so the conclusions of of these authors was that you know first viral loading residence and stuff without symptoms was identical so there was no difference in the output of viruses between those who were with or without uh symptoms and that pcr may be used and should be performed and should perform well in asymptomatic individuals that was one question that i mean do this do the pcr has the same sensitivity if you if you do it to in a symptomatic versus an asymptomatic patient and the answer from this study is yes they were both uh similarly positive the other i think interesting finding was that they found that uh the small minority of patient eight to nine percent of the individual tested had ninety percent of the total viral load so so there were this few a group of of individuals who had a very very high viral load and that in part could explain the phenomenon that we have seen with the super spreader so not everybody has the same amount of virus there are those you know a little bit less than 10 who actually harbor a lot of viruses in their natural firings and they are believed to be the the the explanation of the most likely explanation for these super spread events that we have seen in churches in in choirs and in different uh um congregate settings the other the other interesting publication was about the the cutaneous manifestation and there was this in in jama um the finding of of these um um purpuric skin lesions especially in the hands and feet of patients and actually when i was looking at this paper i found a pre-publication the a group from spain is actually coming coming up with a publication in the british journal of dermatology of all the clinical um rashes that have been observed with scars so i'm going to show you some some pictures of other but this is like the classical actual um findings or or distal findings in patients and what you see here in the histology is actually inflammation in the blood vessels and then this micro thrombi this pink color in within the cells are are actually thrombosis um found in on on the on the skin biopsies of these of these patients so it's it's it's something that it's been already described as a complication of of sarcoma and this is the paper that i was referring to it's a group of from spain they actually describe all of the findings that they they saw in spain and they classified the different manifestations in the acreal erythema which is what we just saw um vesicular eruptions in nine percent of the patients orticaria lesions in 19 maculopols in 47 which is the most common manifestation and the level on the cross is in six percent so there are different types of lesions in the associated what they have been associated with with that these are some of the photos from the spanish paper this is a macular popular rice this is another more popular rash also in in a patient with kobe this is a more vesicular small vesicles in the skin uh this is the typical orticario with the with the wheel um and and these are some of the the echemotic or or or leave it on the crosses in the in the uh in this case in in the gluteal area and another vesicular rise so so so we are starting to understand the the different uh cutaneous manifestations um of of kobe and been described and this is the typical uh acura erythema edema almost like like uh scene with coal so this digital erythema there so that was interesting so that's it that's that's my update for today thank you nestor uh your updates are always incredible and i learned so much i feel like i'm back in medical school i learned so so much really appreciate it one thing i i did want to mention along the lines of these uh the cancer the six cancer diagnoses uh kind of or the identification of these cancer diagnoses going uh way down over the past five five and a half months um the rates of uh substance use disorder and especially opiate overdose um opiate overdoses actually have been on the uptick kind of in a similar fashion you might say nora volkl from who leads the national institutes of drug abuse in the nih wrote a really really good paper it's called the collision of um the collision of substance use disorders and and covet 19 and she talks about how uh substance use disorder and other social determinants of and other kind of diseases related to social determinants of health are on the uptick uh with regard to kind of covid just as you were ex showing with the the new york city pregnancy data so thanks nestor um i wanted to see if i wanted to turn it over to marla marla sivers from is one of the senior epidemiologists from the department of health and injury prevention um i wanted to see if marla could give us some updates hi good morning joanna um i had one update to share today um there was a press release that went out yesterday on sunday regarding the resumption of some long-term care and nursing home visitation i think the question has come up on this call before and i know um it's been you know a real concern for nursing home residents and their families and loved ones visitation was discontinued temporarily back at the beginning of march when cases were on the uptick here in new mexico in an attempt um to help avoid what we'd seen in some of the other early cobit states like washington where there'd been introduction of the infection into nursing homes and it had really um just sort of run rampant through the facility and there had been a high mortality associated with that so nursing home visitation was restricted uh back on march 16th i believe and only sort of end of life visitation was allowed and all regular visitation was temporarily suspended the governor's office and the aging and long-term services department have been working along with the medical advisory team for several weeks to try to come up with a plan to safely resume nursing home visitation and so that has been finalized and it is posted to the cvnmhealth.org today and so there's a new button there that will show you which counties allow nursing home visitation so there is some gating criteria like many of the other resumption of activities in new mexico and currently there are 21 counties who qualify to have a nursing home visitation resume today and those are counties that have a test positivity rate of lower than 5 percent so 21 counties in new mexico meet that criteria it's going to be updated monthly using uh the latest information and the nursing home visitation does have some other caveats obviously people who are ill are not allowed to visit in the nursing home the nursing home can't currently be having an outbreak of covet 19 visits have to be scheduled in advance so that the facility can make sure that residents and visitors are are safely escorted and remain appropriate distance and that people are masked so there are some guidelines around it but this is a big development and something that you know people have been working on for several weeks and um stakeholders have been very interested in finding a way for this to safely resume so we're we're happy to be able um to allow that start to start happening effective today thank you marla so much for that great update and it's really good news that finally nursing home residents will get some company from their loved ones at least in many many communities 21 of the 35 counties so that's fantastic um dr leslie hayes are you on the line i think you have a very brief update before we go to questions you are one of our hub team members thank you sure um mental health america which is an organization i'd never heard of before but they do screening for mental health um issues and they published some data they had huge increases in screening with even higher percentage turning positive in may and june um and um anxiety depression psychosis interest in those up and um then suicidal thoughts in addition and what i thought was especially interesting is they said the biggest contributor was actually loneliness and isolation that was about two-thirds of people cited that as contributing to their mental health health issues coronavirus was obviously an issue but that was only about a third so it's actually more sort of the indirect effects of loneliness and isolation um past trauma and relationship problems also were fairly substantial contributors so just something to think about that um these are significant issues among our patients and then the other one i found an interesting site um called cove kid project and it's uh from women's institute for independent social inquiry and basically they are tracking data on kids with covid and so far um that they stated there have been 104 deaths from covet in children and teens in 27 different states this is certainly nowhere near 160 000 we have in adults but still it's not zero and there have also been roughly a thousand um children admitted to pediatric icus um from cobain it is it was just kind of interesting statistics to me and like i said it's nowhere near the adult numbers but it also is definitely not zero and something we do need to pay attention to thank thank you so much leslie nestor did you have any wanna have any comments on that no just just i just remember there was one one paper that it didn't made it into my summary but they published the experience with the inflammatory syndrome at the in the mmwr on on august 7. so for those who seek kids and want to see a more complete over 500 cases they they actually analyze in the mmwr of these multi-system inflammatory syndrome in kids i haven't had time to really review it but it's it's uh i know they publish that experience and it's interesting we'll probably go over it next week thank you nestor and thanks marla thanks leslie and thanks for everybody who's listening and has their brains turning on um i'm going to turn to some of these chat questions right now there's a chat question from dr harry siebold um which has me thinking about what's going on in our country regarding some of these states that have such a high prevalence right now he says has the sensitivity of the available rapid antigen tests changed in recent weeks or are the same tests available um wanted to know nestor if you kind of knew about any of these rapid antigen tests i saw um just let me preface this also by saying i saw an article today there was a physician or a public health doctor from harvard from the harvard school of public health talking about these states that have such high rates of covet positive like florida and texas arizona um you know that if there was some very very quick um test you know that had a very um you know high high reliability that a patient could do at home you know that had turned around you know immediately wouldn't that be just um amazing if we could get something out there reliable that we could just distribute rapidly with very very low costs i just thought i would throw that out um and for kent the person's name is dr michael mina from harvard and it just seemed a really interesting thought yeah no i haven't really seen anything new except for the tests that have been approved i mean we know that the pcrs the ones that are done by the large laboratories like lab core tri-core quest have a very high sensitivity and specificity some of the the more rapid tests have a decrease in the sensitivity but it is discrete and what i have seen it's uh i have seen more than one already two or three papers on on that sometimes you can sacrifice the sensitivity of the test uh for a quick turnaround especially if you need it for for uh you know for uh contract tracing or or a rapid containment of an epidemic even if you use a suboptimal test um but you have a rapid turnaround it's it's better than having a you know six days or seven days of turnaround time that's what i've seen a lot of emphasis on that especially from from like modeling examples and when they actually model the intervention um according to the time of to positive tests and definitely you know something that is 80 or 90 percent sensitive as opposed to 95 or 97 but you can have it in a day or two it's probably useful uh from an epidemiological standpoint obviously you're gonna have some false positive and false negatives that you have to deal with but but it's important to have a rapid turnaround time also thank you nestor um another question is um have you addressed those patients who have prolonged positivity but we theorize or dr siebel do you want to maybe unmute and ask that your question dr siebel i'll just continue uh nestor um have you have you addressed um those patients have prolonged positivity uh when sniffs require one to two negative tests to return to the facility do you seek viral cultures or do you simply try to get them to go with cdc guidelines right yeah that's a good question i mean the problem with i mean we don't we don't we don't we don't look for viral cultures viral cultures are are expensive they take a long time they can take three sometimes three weeks for the wild buyers to grow and they are insensitive it's you know you need a very high bar load to be able to culture the the the virus from respiratory secretion so uh and i think that those reasons are are some of the reasons used by the by cdc to actually move away from from having like two negative testing like we did at the beginning and we're really going with the symptom-based um strategy more than with the test-based strategy and the other thing that we have learned is that some patients have a very prolonged intermittent rna excretion and that doesn't necessarily mean that they are infectious there are some evidence from korea that i have mentioned that people who have persistently positive uh rna or persistent repository pcr did not um generate any secondary infections in their households so they didn't infect anybody despite the fact that they were at home and having this positive um pcr so so i think those are are the the main factors but definitely we're not doing viral culture except within like research of you know studies or very specific biological research studies but not as a public health or even a clinical useful test great and um my screen just froze nester so i'm going to have you um ask some chat questions while i figure this out i'm looking for for some of the questions there was a question from deborah mcgrew for the but it was for the librarian to actually see if there was any article on um and there's a question again from dr siebel and has anyone noted barbara vegetations or lesions associated with calling i i i think i mentioned uh last week one paper on on abnormalities in the um magnetic resonance of the heart there have been some abnormalities um like pericardial enhancement decreasing the left ventricular ejection fracture but i haven't seen any anything on like endocarditis or an endocarditis or bible or uh disease associated with uh with with kobe 19 so far so so i i would say the answer so far is no but there are there are some cardiac and i remember this paper had a very high percentage of abnormality it was 78 of those who had us uh cardiac uh magnetic resonance had some type of abnormality so so it was it was uh extremely high and these were presumably non-selective patients there were patients who are consecutive patients in germany that actually um perform both troponin and and cmr magnetic resonance of the heart and and they found that 78 had some abnormality which was much much higher to the controls that they use but but that as far as i know i haven't seen any any uh valuable abnormalities hi dr sessa this is twee i see carlos nolasko has a question um carlos would you like to unmute and ask your question thank you sure hello um so i had i had a question about any data about the likelihood of healthcare workers being more symptomatic or um or having a more severe disease you know compared with the general population i know that the paper that nasser presented today um uh just shows that the the the the prevalence is about the same but there's a paper in the lancet that shows that in an app um the healthcare workers are more likely to be symptomatic when compared to the general population so i want to have any any comments from nestor i i don't know if there's any data about it right i remember some of the earlier papers from china that the severity and mortality of healthcare worker was lower but those findings have to be really analyzed and you know in association with the other comorbid condition because in general um healthcare workers tend to be younger a lot of young physicians nurses and other healthcare workers so so i remember that that you know it was it was nice to see that there were uh relatively fewer death uh especially at the beginning of the epidemic among healthcare workers than the general population in china but i haven't seen any papers to be honest and i haven't read this lancet paper that you mentioned about uh symptoms and kobe that just remember that there was also a publication actually um i don't remember it it was it was in something called mbox [Music] in which they mention how mad the use of masks can decrease the percentage of of severe disease because it will probably decrease the inoculum of of the the virus that was an interesting it was an opinion paper it was not actually uh an original publication but an opinion paper from i think professors from from i think california and and and john hopkins i'm going to get it for for for the group to to see but it was interesting to to to you know the way they they analyzed the data and they said that since universal masking has been implemented not only we have seen more um less transmission among healthcare workers and in the community in general but also a higher percentage of asymptomatic or possible or people with few symptoms as opposed to more severe disease and and that and the explanation that they give as a possibility is that that you're decreasing the the inoculant of the virus when you use a mask even if you don't prevent it completely from acquiring you acquire less of an inlocus and supposedly it could be associated with mildly disease but i really have to look into that paper and and and read it carefully because it was mostly an opinion paper but i haven't seen anything on what you when you mention carlo to be honest thank you this is um thank you carlos this is joanna katzman i'm just having a little technical difficulty with gathering some of the pre-registration questions so if you remember your pre-registration question and you can put it into the chat um please do so and uh i will ask it to dr sosa or marlar nester right away and we'll we're quickly gathering those pre-registration questions and getting them into chat i'm so sorry it's one of the one of the problems of being remote and luckily this is the first time that it's happened since mid mid-march so thank you for your patience but please uh please write your questions into chat and we will get right to you there's a question about convalescent plasma i think from shamrom martin i can i can take yes shamron is yes from deborah mcgrew absolutely go ahead go right ahead nestor yeah so what criteria used for compilation plasma to be honest you know we haven't used a lot of convalescent plasma at least at unm at the beginning we did a study in which we enrolled 13 patients uh and and it was a clinical trial um to to evaluate more than the the clinical response because we didn't we didn't have a control group was actually to measure the the neutralizing antibodies we were actually going to publish that data in in journal of infectious disease it has been accepted so it should come out in the next few weeks uh but unfortunately we didn't we didn't see a significant increase in the in the neutralizing antibodies after the the transfusion so so from that from that paper we actually um recommended that we need to select the donors they we need to measure neutralizing antibodies and the donors um and the criteria was really you know anybody who was admitted twice to to our to our hospital and at that point when we did the study um most of the patient was wearing icu because they were actually transferred from from the northwest from the navajo nation a patient that they couldn't care take care they actually send that to us when they had the the the big surge in in number of cases so we're really very very sick um individuals that we treated with with convalescent plasma uh so but basically it was having a positive test and being admitted to a unit where the the inclusion criteria the the general consensus and i have read both papers and and and opinion papers on these is that the the earlier the better for convalescent plasma these have been seen with other diseases that if you wait long enough you know the benefit of plasma is probably uh decreases because you the host produces his own or her own antibodies as the disease progresses so so if you're going to use passive immunity either monoclonal antibodies or comalysen plasma the idea is to use it really early so i would say you know after after diagnosis if the patient is submitted uh and and there's an option of using convalescent plasma that said there hasn't been really a significant single paper that have shown benefit from convalescent plasma there was recently a meta-analysis of of of all of the papers published and they found that the convalescent plasma decreases mortality more or less by 50 but it's a meta-analysis when you look at the individual papers from from the different investigators the good quality papers didn't show a significant benefit only when you aggregate you start seeing sort of a trend towards some benefit from convalescent plasma thank you nestor um do you see the question um from uh from fred from fred fox says it and i think jeffrey miller might might be on here too uh might be on our call are you dr miller yes yes i'm on here oh great would you like to maybe nestor would it be okay if dr miller comments on that question from dr fox i i think was the other way around i asked the question dr fox commented great uh i was asking the questions jeffrey miller family practice in albuquerque cold and flu season is going to be a among us before long and uh um presumably the southern hemisphere has had some experience already with cold and flu season along with coven 19 and i wondered uh sort of two parts one with cold and flu and then a small second part is if there are any recommendations at an outpatient standpoint of how to evaluate such patients you know many of us don't have n95 masks to bring people in the office and so how to evaluate that and then somewhat related uh people can get copd or asthma exacerbations that often include some steroid component of treatment um has there been any uh particular changes and recommendations that way yeah those are difficult questions to be honest uh i i'm certainly hoping that we don't have such an active influenza season this year because of all the social distancing and wearing masks uh i cannot imagine a very hard influenza season on top of what we are living with sars kobe 2 um from the prevention standpoint i think uh important things is that if you put a mask on the patient and you put yourself a mask you are decreasing significantly the transmission so that's that's a first step i mean if you have somebody with respiratory symptoms um that you're going to see in the middle of covid and influenza season definitely mask the patient max yourself even if you don't have an n95 uh you know both wearing surgical masks and trying to keep uh some reasonable distance it's a good it's a good idea i i imagine that that rapid test will come in which you can actually do sars and and influence at some point to help but i i'm not aware of any at this point i know that that owl has one platform that that diagnosis uh sars and and and and and also and also flu in the same uh so so yeah so those i don't know the other part of the question i i forgot sorry dr miller the other part of the question was uh that uh in a primary care standpoint are often seen people with copd or asthma exacerbations in which steroids uh play a part be it uh inhaler or oral and uh that gets a little complicated too in terms of when to introduce those in uh in your asthma or copd exacerbation plan and i didn't know any input on that right what i have seen from the from the guidelines and and and protocol from different uh hospitals is that you you're not supposed to discontinue or or change your management of steroids in front of of of kobe 19 so you you would use the steroid the same way um i wouldn't i wouldn't change any anything um and and if anything you know later in the disease uh dexamethasone have shown to decrease mortality so so i you may be adding an advantage there is there is a study coming i mean they're doing the study right now with inhale steroids and coping 19 and so we don't have the result we know that there are people who are actually advocating for the use of inhales terribly we have no robust data but i think we're going to have um a study that um to evaluate that that question if if if inhaled steroids are in any way helpful or harmful for kobe 19 but we don't know at this point i think the recommendation of most of the societies is you know treat your the underlying disease as you would normally if you need to use bronchodi use bronchodilators or steroids you need to use them and and and uh and go from there and obviously the patient is severely ill and is admitted consider steroids later in the course of the disease because of the dexamethasone recovery trial from from the uk thanks dr miller thank you dr sosa there there's a couple of questions that came from the pre-registration we put into the chat um related to kind of transmission and immunity just going back to some earlier questions um many months ago and they're from they they range from does getting kova 19 really provide immunity or is her herd immunity a fallacy and then a couple other questions are just really going back to you know how likely is it for you to get coven 19 from from different surfaces whether it's uh keyboards or or animals or or and then and then does removing and reapplying the same mask many times cause significant spread and then finally uh perhaps a question for you or marla is three feet distance with a mask sufficient to provide to protect against the spread of infection so if both people are masked i'm assuming so nestor i'll like yeah immunity yes you know and we these have been evolving uh first of all the great majority of patients who get copy 19 especially those who have symptoms develop immunity that's the first uh sort of general statement a lot of trials from china europe and the us have shown that there uh you know significant proportion of patients develop antibodies um there's also mounting evidence that there's also a cellular immunity that that may be long-lasting that that's another piece of good news uh so so i think the the question that we ask ourselves in march and april i mean if this is going to induce any any uh immunity that the answer is yes how long does it last uh it's it's a question that is still open uh we have seen papers in which they actually can document how some of the antibodies actually decrease after eight weeks or ten weeks of the disease so there is evidence that some patients will have um we lose their antibodies we don't know what what that means because if you have memory cells if you are recharged with the virus and this is other viruses in which when you are a challenge with something that you have memory t cells they again stimulate the b cells to produce antibodies so you can have sort of a rebound or or a boosting effect even if you don't have like very high measurable antibodies but we still don't know we know that there is an immune response that at least from the laboratory some point some of these antibodies go down we have seen that people with a very mild disease or asymptomatic they have less of an immune response at least a measurable less of a measurable immune response uh so they they will be more of a concern for a risk for reinfection regarding reinfection i mean they have been anecdotes of reinfection but we have almost 20 million uh human beings document with documentary infections in the world and very few real you know well documentary infection so far so if it happens it probably happens but it's a rare event that's a good news at least in the in the you know a couple of months after the acute disease we haven't really seen like these you know large series of reinfection we have seen here and there people in the media you know a few isolated reports of reinfection but it's really not the main driver of this epidemic uh so far um with a few months from the from the beginning of the epm i think that's what we know uh the other part is the vaccines vaccines are seems to be inducing both uh cellular immunity and and also antibody production um we still have to do the phase three to see if those uh antibodies and those cell immunity actually protects you from a natural infection so that's where they're doing these studies in brazil in california and many other places where the virus is circulating they're vaccinating 1000 30 000 people in the modern trial to see if those 30 000 people or half of them which are going to be vaccinated with the active uh versus the placebo are are in fact protected that we don't know it's too early to tell probably in december or november we'll have an answer if they're actually protected from natural infection with the vaccine um so that that's i think from what we know uh some of the things that we have learned from from the study in the immunity of the thesis which was the the first regarding the the survival of the virus in surfaces uh we know that it it varies from with the type of surface but we know that definitely from hours to days some of these uh in some in some uh surfaces like stainless steel and other lasted for for you know many many hours up to three to four days uh in the right environmental conditions obviously there are many factors temperature humidity exposures uv light that may shorten um the survival or the viability of the virus but it definitely can last in theory for for hours up to three to four days in some some sources and the good news for for us is that usually porous material like like a mask and and and and other the survival is less than in in materials like metal like like stainless steel for for instance so so that's what we are for instance at some point and this is a question related to the reuse of a mask some authorities have recommended that if you use your n95 and you leave it you know to rest for four or five days you can use it again because probably the virus if there was any virus on the outside of the mask is probably inactivated you know just by by being on the mask for five for five days so that's i don't know if uh marla wants to comment about the three feet or or six feet uh with the masking marlin are you there yeah i'm here so i think um just to follow up uh dr hayes put a link in the chat box to a good article about a fomite transmission and i think many of the studies that have been done about how long a virus can last on a surface have been done in laboratory conditions so as dr sosa said uh it's hard to replicate that in real world conditions um and also the viral inoculum in those studies has been fairly high um you know more than you would typically see on a surface so it's hard to to really say exactly how in real world conditions um fomites contribute to virus transmission cdc has said you know they don't think that it's a significant driver of um infections or outbreaks and um as i said dr hayes put a good article um that was in the atlantic last week um about fomite so that's an interesting read the recommendation is six feet um whether you're masked or not um even with the mask if both people wear a mask i try to maintain six feet of distance depending on the mask that a person is using they're going to perform differently in terms of source control so maintaining that distance is still important even if both people are wearing a face covering of some kind thank you marla uh so much thank you leslie for providing that uh link too and for all your great feedback i just wanted to let everybody know that at about 12 45 yeah to the dot we provided the feedback um the cme link so you should have that and just moving on to some more questions um this is from uh from dutchin from the indian health service they asked how are primary care clinics or urgent care planning to provide nebulizer treatments for asthmatics or copd patients when we don't have negative pressure rooms in clinics just wanted to know nestor if you've been in any conversations with your colleagues about um handling that no no no really i mean our recommendation and i i i usually talk with megan brad our hospital epidemiologist and she's always recommended to try to stay away from nebulizing patients uh you know to the best of your your your abilities because there is a risk of obviously a racializing virus if you use uh you know aerosolized treatment or neutralized treatment that's as far as i can say thank you um and then uh deborah bear dr bear do you want to unmute and ask your question if you're available sure i think um what i hear a lot is questions about how to really function in a primary care setting in terms of strep testing and even just how much close contact should we have with patients especially my concern is with asymptomatic spread and people coming in for um trigger point injections annual visits i mean if you're going to be doing six feet away but is it are you really needing to auscultate the lungs and heart how much risk are you putting yourself in by doing these types of close contact debra this is joanne i feel the same way as a neurologist who primarily practices pain and should i how many close contact visits should i have with trigger point injections and the like so i hear you nestor any thoughts on this or marla yeah what we do here at unm i'm doing clinics here at unm i do my id opt clinic and i see patients every day i wear a mask the patient wears a mask surgical mask or procedure mask no not 8.95 uh you know there's there's always a risk of erusalization but it's it's have to be really really small we haven't had that many um healthcare workers uh infected and most of them have have acquired the disease in the community not in the healthcare setting so you know it depends on what the the status of the epidemic is in your in your hospital your county your city um really to to try to gauge the risk but you know we we are following cdc recommendations we are using procedure mask on ourselves and and the patients are and so far the risks have been really really small we don't do obviously uh aerosol generating procedures uh without n95 or in an appropriate negative pressure room uh but usual patient care the risk i i have the feeling that it's not that high if you take those precautions my clinic says that surgical mask for both patients and providers and then if you're going to be looking in somebody's mouth or you know um up close then we had a face shield as well so yeah that's a good i forgot that yeah we have mandatory facial in the hospital the actually the ppe committee implemented that a few weeks ago and and we're using all eye protection and and surgical mask for everything and we we ask the patient to have uh the the mask as soon as they get into the into the hospital i think the other thing i'll add just for care that um is not urgent or emergent in nature is pre-screening people who are coming in for appointments so asking about known exposures do they have household members who are positive cases have they currently been advised to quarantine um have they recently traveled so just doing some of that pre-screening to help um you know screen out people who might be at higher risk of infection you know is another piece i don't think there's a you know one perfect solution that's kind of layering on the prevention measures to try to be able to provide the care in the safest manner possible thanks marla that was really important all the all the clinics at unm have pre-screening before they enter the hospital or clinic um dr sebold asks a question kind of related to masks and community spread he says he's he's seen an increasing number of community people wearing masks with an exhaust port he says doesn't that negate the intent of you know preventing the spread i'm wondering marla or nestor if you might comment on that marla yeah i agree you know the masks that have an exhalation valve do not uh provide source control which is the intent uh behind universal masking so masks with an exhalation valve don't protect other people from your respiratory secretions thank you and then maybe one more question just wondering if nestor or marla might be able to just differentiate again for us the difference between the k and 95 mass that are so available for the general public to buy online versus the n95 fit masks and then that might be our last question i think yeah i would defer tomorrow i'm not very familiar with the kn-95 um yeah what i will say you know the main difference is that the kn-95 kind of is a more one-size-fits-all mask it's not fit tested for each user so having that really tight seal is um important for mask performance and if you're really trying to get that 95 filtration um on inhalation you need that tight seal so a poorly fitting kn 95 mask is not going to be any more effective than a surgical or procedure mask thank you marla um i wanted to just thank everybody for their patience today with my technical difficulties um i had some internet problems at home today and i lost connection to the source of our pre-registration questions but i think we got most of them um wanted to remind everybody that um we're continuing to have this amazing office hours with dr sosa dr hayes and marla sivers from the new mexico department of health every monday at uh 12 noon mountain time we also have a first responder resiliency echo every monday at 2 p.m mountain time and that's today in in one hour today's topic is moral distress um when clinicians are feeling kind of exhausted and burnt out and um this uh this first responder resiliency echo is open to really all frontline clinicians including um traditional first responders paramedics firefighters police officers and thursday mornings at eight every thursday morning dr michelle harkins has her critical care echo every other wednesday we have a nursing home echo and frequently on monday mornings we have a global global conversations echo with uh fantastic talks from different um different clinicians and subject matter experts from all around the all around the world really so most of you are on our email list and we just love you seeing you and um with that nestor do you have any more cl any last closing comments no thank you you did a great job today we were by yourself and with some i.t issues so thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining one more time and we'll see you next week with more uh updates thank you nestor so much hi patrick can you transfer the hub team to the debrief room thank you um um [Music] friends and references i was like oh my god where are the questions and then the first question that i got that i got was for the librarian like where can i find this information i was like oh my god i got the wrong question there was very few questions today i mean usually the questions kind of actually could take us through almost the whole session right oh really i think we um needed to let them know what was going on so in a in a weird way i thought it was better this time that we were transparent and that we showed them that we actually do keep their questions that we brought them back to the chat i actually thought it was actually beautiful that like we're infallible we normally have them in a separate place we had some items,,8/10/2020
16,it's hours uh we're very happy to see your faces today um as we always mentioned at the beginning of the clinics we would love to see you um on camera if you're if you have a camera available because we love to to see people's faces and we like to build communities so we're very happy to to have you today again um we will be um using the chat box for questions only uh if you have a question for the hub team please put the the question in the chat box we would ask you to refrain from actually answering questions in the chat box unless you're one of the hub team members um the other thing that's gonna you'll see in the chat are um uh references and and resources that are put in there by our digital librarian uh about things that come up we got quite a few questions beforehand in the registration so we'll try to answer those but if again if you have a question during this session please uh please let us know about that so i'm going to go ahead and introduce myself i'm carla thornton i'm an infectious disease physician here at unm one of the associate directors at project echo and i'll be co-facilitating this session with my colleague joanna katzman joanna do you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody joanna katzman i work with carla project deco and i'm glad to help carla and mr sosaud and and marla sivers and leslie hayes thanks carla thank you so we'll do introductions of the other hub team members uh in a minute but i'm going to go ahead and turn it over to dr nester sosa who's our chief of infectious diseases here at unm who has some updates to share with us and then we'll uh move into the questions after that an introduction of our other hub thank you nestor hi thank you carla and joanna welcome everybody and thank you for joining let me share my screen here for the update can you all see the slides okay yes we could see them okay thank you okay so the first uh few articles that i want to highlight uh have to do with the immunity we have a lot of questions about the immunity of this virus and i think um two of the papers that i'm gonna refer to actually shed some light on some of these issues with the immunity we have been showing some papers about the duration of antibody that was another small publication but well uh well done publication on on the duration of of kobe 19 antibodies there's also a question as you know you know a significant percentage of patients um who get corbin 19 produce antibodies and some of these antibodies are the so-called neutralizing antibodies that in vitro inhibit the capacity of the virus to infect cells but the question is do those neutralizing antibodies that we measure in the laboratory are they really protective there was a small um actually story from uh from an outbreak in a fishing vessel who actually sits online on that and then there was some some confusion on the on the media about an announcement of cdc that i want to highlight and clarify so those those are some of the initial articles so this is the the paper the paper is called dynamics of neutralizing antibody fighters and essentially they measure the antibodies on 34 patients five a hospitalized patient with severe copy 22 not hospitalized and seven asymptomatic patients and you can see in this graph that uh and this is sort of the the the fall change in the in the antibody how they go down with time so after 90 days since uh symptom onset the patient had essentially one quarter of the levels of neutralizing antibody that they had um initially on the first determination 30 days after symptom onset and if you um stratify them by symptoms yellow being the symptomatic hospitalized patient have higher levels of antibody but then as you can see as the day go by the the levels tend to go go down and the same occurs with the other patients with the non-hospitalized and with the asymptomatic um but to a less degree so it's interesting that more papers are actually pointing out to the reality that probably the antibodies at least the measurable antibodies are not going to last too long with these with this um virus the other interesting paper was an outbreak uh that occur in a in a shipping sorry fishing vessel that left a seattle in the midst of the of the pandemic there were 122 persons in that in that on board and of those 104 tested positive either by pcr or cerro converted by antibodies so an 85.2 percent uh attack rate extremely high even higher than the georgia outbreak in the the summer camp in georgia that was around 75 i remember correctly so this was even higher attack rate which highlights the the transmissibility of this virus in close um spaces like like the the inside of a of a boat or a ship and and but the interesting thing is that there were three uh sailors here in this uh study that had neutralizing antibodies when they got on board because they measure um the rtpcr and also measure antibodies on these subjects before and after and those three subjects that did not that did have neutralizing antibodies did not get infected so despite the fact that a lot of their coworkers got infected they were protected and when you use you know a simple four by four four table and do an analysis of the infected with neutralizing antibodies uh non-infected without neutralizing antibodies the this finding was a statistically significant although obviously we're only talking about about three subjects we neutralize an antibody but it's interesting that is the first time that the presence of neutralizing antibodies actually correlates with uh with protection obviously we'll see much more of this when we use uh when we do the vaccine studies with other with other uh studies but it's interesting that is the first um at least that i am aware of the first publication of actually showing the protection of neutralizing antibodies from infection in a very uh in a high high attack rate situation the other the other issue was more of a confusion from the from the media i i think it was thursday yeah thursday or friday that i saw in several of the of the media outlet both on tv and and social media and written press they were saying the cdc had um uh suggested that patients who have covered have protection for three months they were immune for three months um and and that was in several of the new channels i was surprised because i i didn't i read the the guidance of cc and i didn't read the same message and in fact the following day on friday august 14 actually the cdc came up with a media statement clarifying that and they said contrary to media reporting this science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection so there was sort of a confusion in the message and what they what they were saying is that if you have copied you don't need to repeat uh the pcr test at least for three months because you know it's going to be intermittently positive that we have discussed previously but that doesn't mean that the person is completely immune because there's no no data to that regard uh so far except for the the the data that i just mentioned about the neutralizing antibody on that uh small group of of sailors or fe or fishermen okay the other the other interesting question i have you know we we have discussed this in our in our um in in these meetings why do children have less severe disease and there are many hypotheses if you remember that there's speculation that because children receive a live virus vaccination they they have like an indirect or or sort of of a cross-reactive protection somehow but i found actually i we had a lecture on on pediatric coping in one of the sessions that i attended and i saw an article which i thought it was interesting it was an article it was actually published in may but i had missed it uh in which they measured the expression of ace a two of the receptor of the coronavirus in the nasal mucosa of of of people and they and in different age groups and they found that the kids actually the kids less than 10 years had a much lower expression of h2 in their mucosa so that's sort of a clue is the first like you know at least possible explanation for for the difference in the in the in the disease severity obviously there's much more to learn about this but it's interesting to see that that um at least in this study the kids with less than 10 years had a lower expression of the receptor for the virus in their nasal mucosa compared with young young people's 10 to 17 18 to 24 and more than 25 uh so that was i thought it was interesting although it's not a new article but it highlights these uh possible explanations for the difference and there were a couple of papers uh actually one of the papers was actually cited by the governor by uh by by our governor here about mask so there was a study published in jama in which they actually compare um the filtration capacity of the filtration efficiency of 895 respirators surgical mice masks with ties or straps and and procedure mask with ear loops and you can actually see that the filtration capacity obviously and this is expected was much better with the n95 and they included in this in this analysis even expired in 95 the 95 that had 11 years of uh have expired 11 years before so it was interesting that they they um still were able to feel to filter most of the particles measuring these and this study um obviously surgical mats with ties were better 71.5 percent filtration compared with the wars which are these a procedure mask that only filtrate 30.1 percent uh so it was interesting and they did this story with a with a man and a woman and different sizes of respirators it was an interesting story for those interested but definitely n95 confer a highest degree of filtration as we know um if you compare with the others but it was interesting to find that there was a difference between the surgical mask and the procedure mask in the filtration capacity really really interesting the other and this is the paper that was cited by by actually by the by the governor in one of the press conference was a relatively easy compar i mean cheap and inexpensive way to compare the efficacy of the filtering um of different masks especially cloth masks and and bandanas and other that the general public are are uh using so this this uh investigator from duke university actually devised a very simple um [Music] process and how to measure the filtration capacity they had a cell phone that they took up a video of of the of the what was happening they used a laser a simple green light uh laser uh and then they they had the subject stopped with the mask on and then they measured the number of particles that that were that were going through the mask and and they tested different types of mask from from the a95 the surgical or procedure mask to different types of cloth masks including fleas and bandanas and to make a long story short obviously the best filtering um the the the draws for the n95 and the surgical maps they were very effective retaining our our uh our drops when we talked um but and and some of the some of the cloth masks like the one made with polyester and cotton was also very effective but the least effective were obviously the bandanas and even the fleece was higher than not using a mask that was some somewhat surprising and apparently it's because the the fleece or very thin layers of cloth actually they they break the the drop the drops and and they can actually be more uh in the in the camera than than than without the mask so definitely you know what type of mask you use may make a difference so those made with combined fabrics or several layers or surgical masks are better than anything like bandanas or fleece uh at the moment of retaining our own uh secretions that was that was an interesting it was published in science advanced and then an update on on convalescent plasma here at the university of new mexico we published our study uh that we did with convalescent plasma we actually enrolled uh 12 patients at the end because one third we enrolled 13 but one we drew consent and we we treated this patient with a convalescent plasma and we measure the neutralizing antibodies before and after transfusion and we also measure neutralizing antibodies in the donor plasma and what we found was somewhat disappoint disappointing we found that there was no uh not a significant increase in neutralizing titus after transfusion in the recipients so in fact 9 out of 12 so the majority of subjects that were transfused didn't have an increase in the neutralizing antibodies on the day after the transfusion so so we were probably not selecting correctly the donors or or having donor plasma with a very um low concentration of neutralizing antibodies and and the same was good for igg and igm level there was really no significant increase overall in this small group of subjects um in the in the levels of igg and igm and in fact it almost looked like they were producing their own antibodies at their own pace actually the antibodies peaked on day seven the neutralizing antibodies and igg peaked almost a week after the enrollment so it was no relation to the transfusion um and the same thing the the viral load of this patient decreased but it was really decreased after a week of uh of being in the hospital probably not related to the transfusion of plasma so that was somewhat disappointing the only sort of good news is that there was a correlation between the the igg the measurement of igc and neutralizing antibodies both in the donors and in the patient so that means that you can actually measure igg and and if it's very high in the donor it will probably correlate with a high level of neutralizing antibodies so even if your lab doesn't is not able to measure um neutralizing antibody but can measure igg which is useful to select owners and those those were the conclusion that we need to adequately select donors and and and the correlation between um the igg levels against the s protein and neutralizing antibodies so you can use a igg as a surrogate markers marker for neutralizing antibodies if you don't have the capacity to measure which is somewhat complicated requires sometimes a bsl3 or or some other things that are not readily available okay so i'm gonna leave it here and and we can uh start the question and answers thank you thank you nestor so much for that excellent update um before we get started with questions i just want to introduce other hub team members um leslie leslie hayes can you introduce yourself and if you haven't any updates please please please let us have those updates now thanks for having family medicine espanola new mexico just a comment that uh there's some suggestion that um uh trump is pushing oleandran now which is from the oleander plant and has not been studied at all so just be prepared for questions on that so thank you leslie and also i want to introduce marla siebers who is an infectious disease epidemiologist from the department of health here in new mexico marla if you would introduce yourself and and if you have an update first that would be great doctor hi everyone marla sivers new mexico department of health a brief update um you all probably saw the press conference last week and the new slides that were released new mexico as a state is moving in a hopeful direction um we've had five days in a row now without i with uh case counts being under 200 some newly identified cases under 200 our reproductive rate for the state um is less than one it's at 0.73 as of the 12th last week and i know there were some questions um with testing you know changes in testing priorities particularly in the albuquerque metro area many of the health systems that were doing a lot of asymptomatic testing um announced they would only be doing symptomatic testing so there was sort of a question if we were reducing our testing capacity and only testing people who were symptomatic how would that you know affect the numbers that we've been trending but overall our number of tests done each day has not changed we're still testing about 6 800 people a day statewide um so i think that the um reduced positivity rate statewide less than three percent um you know is comparable with um previous numbers um because even though sort of the testing uh strategy changed a little bit we're still testing uh the same number of people each day and finding good results thank you thank you very much marla okay just um before we get into the we'll go ahead and look at the chat questions first um lynn colemeyer do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question sure um can you explain the neutralizing antibodies a little bit more how did you know or why did you only measure them day one i mean in the story you mean uh we measure before and after transfusion uh and the idea is that that once you transfuse the plasma you know after 24 hours you can actually measure and then from then they will decay or the patient himself or herself will produce their their own antibodies so the the what we were expecting was to see an increase in the neutralizing antibodies after you transfuse the plasma because you're giving him you know 200 ml of of antibodies from a person who has recovered so we were expecting this rapid race in the in the next 24 48 hours after the transfusion in the levels of neutralizing antibodies and it didn't move in the grammar occupation there was no effect in in one was actually decrease and in two there was an increase but we thought it was just a random random effect so we were somewhat disappointed and the reason probably i mean we um the the way that the the plasma was selected here was was basically facing had a history of having a positive uh kobe test and they had uh a positive antibody but then we but beta land was so the company was not measuring either neutralizing antibodies or the or the the the elevation in the igg it was just a quantitative uh qualitative yes or no see if the patient was was exposed to copyright or had copied he was a donor our recommendation is that you actually it's better to actually measure the igg or if you if you're able to measure measure the neutralizing antibodies to select better the donor the other thing that we didn't do and it was basically because of the availability we use one unit of plasma per patient 200 ml we didn't adjust it for weight which is another recommendation once you have enough plasma to go around you can actually uh use more if the patient weighs you know more than more than 100 kilos you have to adjust for the weight and we didn't because it was sort of our our you know we are only one unit available for every every patient at the at the beginning of this pandemic so so those are the things that we actually learned we didn't do a comparison we didn't have like a control group so this is all only to to determine the kinetics of the of the neutralizing antibodies and the viral load when we use the plasma that was our main goal and also to see toxicity we didn't see any significant toxicity associated with transfusion itself but it was only 12 12 patients thank you nestor um also a question but from sarah allen about any data on used in 95 masks or if you wear a cloth mask over your used in 95 any more protection right i can i can mention the story that i that i show in the introduction they actually use several expired n95 and they seem to filter as well as as the the brand new n95 so there was no apparent deterioration in the capacity to filter the filtration efficacy of the mask um and i mean regarding the the use of of a surgical procedure mask i think it's more than anything to protect the mass from being soiled with secretions from the patient if the patient is coughing uh and it's just you know it's it's it's a practice that is widespread i've seen it in in many in many places um and and you know it's a way to try to preserve the a95 if you're going to reuse them you just protect them with the with the with the procedure mask on top mostly to prevent it from soiling from from you know from the patient from from the environment thank you nestor i'm going to go ahead and turn that back over to you joanna okay great thanks carla uh thanks nestor marla and leslie for those great comments and same lynn colemier we really appreciate all these great questions from our group everyone is really contributing uh here's a question from dr chris gonzaga from rehoboth mckinley um medical center in gallup um he's wondering with the coming influenza season uh when is the right time to start doing influenza vaccine vaccinations um wondering what your thoughts are uh nestor and wondering what maybe even marla what the new mexico department of health might be kind of putting out there what their recommendations might be nestor what are your thoughts on that no i think i mean as soon as the as the vaccine is available i think we need to use it i forgot at the end of my presentation there were two papers uh published in jama about influenza and kobe there was an interesting interesting comparison of the sentence incubation period in one of those papers um i think probably the the librarian will be able to to show those those two papers but i did start reading on the on the you know on the um simultaneous epidemic that we are expecting or that may happen in the in the fall so i definitely think i mean as soon as the vaccine or the indication is there we need to vaccinate and there's even the discussion of should we monday like in in colleges or some other settings a monday the vaccine and there's a discussion around that because it's really going to complicate if we have influenza circulating and covet circulating it's going to complicate management diagnosis there's so many things that can get really complicated with with a simultaneous circulation i'm still hopeful that what we saw in march the shortening of the influenza season and the way that we are using protective equipment mask hand washing etc may have an impact on this season but it's it's just wishful thinking on my part i mean there's we don't know what's going to happen we certainly hope hope so i love to hear what marla have to say about about the influenza vaccination and what we are expecting for this for this fall i know we are um awaiting some information from the um immunization practices advisory committee about um the influenza season um they've not come out with any updated guidance for the 2020 2021 season um you know i know they typically recommend that getting vaccinated in july and august might be a little bit too early especially for older people because you get reduced protection later in the season typically their recommendation is september and october being an ideal time um to be vaccinated department of health uh public health division is uh working hard on developing vaccine plans for new mexico obviously the pandemic changes the way that we'll need to do things in terms of offering mass vaccine clinics we may see more of the drive you drive through clinics and less emphasis on workplace vaccine clinics or people visiting pharmacies in person but you know those plans are underway but that's what i would expect is that we'll probably um try to come up with plans in conjunction with cdc guidance for appropriate distancing um for those vaccine clinics so i think it'll look quite different than it normally does um and agree we're hopeful that because of all of the mass use and the social distancing that we'll have a pretty light uh flu season there is a triplex um test that has been developed by cdc that simultaneously will test for cobit 19 and flueway and flu b our state public health lab will have that have that from the cdc for the fall influenza season i don't know if commercial labs will be offering that same test i think we primarily will be using it for surveillance purposes to track flu activity throughout the state more than for clinical diagnostics i just wanted to comment real quick that my son's college is making everyone sign a document that they will get the flu vaccine this year and on the covid group i know other colleges across the country are also doing that i don't know how widespread it is but there are definitely colleges great thanks marla and that by the way everyone that was leslie hayes thank you leslie great great comments um another another comment another comments last question from dr gonzaga is can you comment on the strategy to do the home rapid antigen testing versus other platforms of testing for helping mitigate the pandemic while we're all waiting for the vaccine um i wonder what your thoughts are with that nestor and with that i might add that uh carla's gonna we're gonna try to bring uh uh carissa back from tricore in the next week or two also to help with some of these kind of testing questions right well i i think i've discussed these before but i mean there have been a couple of of um papers that use uh mathematical modeling and frequent testing obviously on the right conditions frequent testing if you get the result rapidly and you can and you can act on it and and do the the isolation or quarantine of the the people who are um detected it's it's it's useful obviously uh some of the rapid tests have they have some limitation they have decreased sensitivity so so if you have a in some instances if you have a negative test and you have a high suspicion and you're using one of these less than perfect test you probably have to go ahead and do a more definitive step sort of an orthogonal um you know algorithm to to be able to to make the diagnosis or rule out the diagnosis in some cases so it's a trade-off the the rapid tests do have uh uh use and and they are indicated if if you can if if it's part of our strategy to do a more rapid contract tracing but on the other hand uh you have to uh be cognizant of the fact that you want to have false negative and false positive and you have to plan around that uh and and have sort of a of a reaction to those results too thank you nestor um adella whole green from chaparral new mexico wonders how many times you can reuse the n95 if you're using the surgical mask kind of over the n95 any wondering what you're perhaps doing nestor at unm hospital i mean here i i mean i don't work directly in the cobic units every day i go see patients i enroll patients in the studies so i was given a couple of of n95 and i use it uh and then put it to rest for a few days and then you know use the next one um i don't think there's a clear story i mean like evidence scientific evidence of how many use how many times you can use the mask uh um you know those mascara used to be disposable before this crisis use it once and you throw them away after after after use them um i guess you know going from the obvious to to the more sophisticated explanations i mean if it's if it if the straps are broken or if it's soil uh you obviously have to throw them away or of the elastic doesn't doesn't fit you have to throw them away um but if not you can you can in theory use it and reuse them and they're institutions who are actually resterilizing them with either ultraviolet light or uh hydrogen peroxide so and and you know so far so far um we have been successful with that procedure and in fact there was a publication on the on the prevalence uh or several prevalence of of copied in new york in one of the new york health systems and they found the same prevalence in healthcare workers compared with with the general public and there was no difference if you work with covid without calling if you were a nurse or a or a physician if you were in the er or an administrative functions there was no difference in the cereal prevalence so that tells you that whatever we're doing this universal masking using n95 reusing the n95 seems to be working overall thanks nestor very very helpful um jeffrey miller uh kind of reminds us that one concern that he has with the influenza vaccine is that you know many many people get it from their pharmacies and then you know there's not going to be a lot of social distancing between the pharmacist or the clinician giving the the vaccine to the to the patient so that's an anticipated problem to overcome during during this vaccination period so something to be mindful about um just looking at some more of our questions uh uh i can look into this for alan caro but it would be interesting to see a list of colleges requiring flu vaccines and [Music] i am going to now turn to oh mary zeitner asked a question following up on revac qx if an older person gets revaccinated should it be the regular dose or the senior dose and i'm wondering if you might be able to comment on that uh nestor but re-vaccinated from one year to the other or vaccinated to twice in the same season i don't know um i'm not sure mary zeitner are you able to unmute i think the original question esther was um there was another revaccination question about if if somebody gets a vaccine early like early in this can they get revaccinated in the spring right if they get like an august or a september uh influenza vaccine we can maybe ask clarissa next week right i i don't know to be honest i haven't read of of the uh usefulness of revaccination in the same season like before i mean great um i'm going to turn to some of our pre-registration questions i'll ask a couple and then turn it back over to carla um just wanted to know nestor um have you seen any emerging uh new emerging uh treatments for uh for chronic complications after infections uh you know michelle harkins had a great talk last week on the critical care echo it wasn't really critical care related but it was regarding unm's um post covet infection clinic it was with dr alicia parrata but wondering what what might be on the horizon for any um kind of emerging treatments regarding covid or regarding kind of chronic complications we hear about post post headache post kind of cognitive uh anything that you're seeing on the horizon no i mean nothing like really dramatic what i've seen is description of those syndromes postcard syndrome there was this publication i think i mentioned a couple weeks ago from germany in which they actually describe a surprisingly high percentage of cardiac abnormalities like 78 of those who were tested with a cmr with a cardiac magnetic resonance had some type of abnormalities uh and it was much higher than the control groups that they selected in that story so kobe seems to be affecting the heart more than what we initially thought and in fact the risk of of athletes like student athletes um that develop kobe may have this silent myocarditis and i have seen you know discussion more than anything in podcasts and other and other forums about this this concern about cardiac obviously there's a long lung dysfunction if you have a severe lung infection you're gonna have some degree of limitation and and hypoxemia with exercise we have seen that in our own patients in the research trial that they come you know a couple of weeks after and they're still using the homoxy and they're not able to exercise like they did before kobe so and i i actually saw an article um the librarian is going to kill me it was about about it was actually a perspective active article on on on the approach like post sepsis that we have like there's like a strategy once a patient leaves the hospital with sepsis regular bacterial sepsis uh the the sepsis campaign actually has like a strict follow-up with criterias rehab indication and a whole bunch of interventions that are done once the patient leave the hospital and they were proposing that we need to use the same approach that once a patient leaves the hospital with severe kobe we have to look after his physical well-being the nutrition you know pulmonary rehab etc so try to to approach a postcard as a multi-systemic issue with all the with all the necessary you know concerns uh to improve the the function and and reduces the quality that this patient can can develop but i haven't seen anything specific of a treatment or anything um for the post kobe syndrome thanks thanks so much nestor um one more question that just might be could take probably three hours to talk about so just maybe i would love to just get a short snippet of your thoughts um and it's regarding kind of the the the late the vaccines that have perhaps the most promise their availability their effectiveness and how how your mind works in terms of the ones that are perhaps in phase three trial and how you might look at the results and assess whether or not they might be good let's say for you to uh to try it out you know what what makes you think a vaccine might be ready to go yeah well the way they're designing these phase three trials with a lot of patients we're talking 10 000 30 000 in one of the one of the protocols that they have mentioned i think we're going to have a very robust information on the efficacy and safety um so so if if a vaccine shows efficacy and safety uh in a in a very large sample like the one that i just mentioned over 10 000 uh subjects um i think that that's going to be um you know enough to convince fda and the european agencies to approve those those um vaccine especially under the current situation with with the outbreak and and the impact on the economy and the and the mortality or lethality that we are seeing so i think that that i think that's going to clinch it if we have a well-designed large study with a good result maybe over 50 or 70 percent efficacy of the vaccine with a safety profile that is that is acceptable and not without any any red herrings or any surprises that will do it that will do it and i think at least there are two modalities that are far advanced the mrna the messenger rna vaccine there are a couple that are entering phase three and a couple of adenovirus vaccines are also moving really fast including the the the russian that have no data but they're going to use it in the general population so at some point we're going to gather some information on that one too uh despite all the criticism which is which is uh well deserved but if they use it and they and they study what they're doing they may get useful data from that too so so i think that's it i i think um as soon as the phase three uh are are finished and if there's efficacy uh it's it's gonna be um it's to be acceptable the only caveat is that that you know if we control the epidemic um and there's there are no patients with coping or or the the the prevalence decreases a lot it's going to be difficult to measure efficacy i remember we did a dna study a dna vaccine for zika in my country in panama before i moved here um and the epidemic went away and we couldn't prove efficacy of the vaccine we had the vaccine we vaccinated you know 300 subjects in my center and and but there was no cases zero cases in the country for the next six months and we couldn't we couldn't improve efficacy it was just you know we measure antibodies we measure neutralizing antibody all the fancy laboratory tests but we couldn't prevent a single infection because there was none they were known in the communities that's also important and that's where they're doing these vaccine studies in in brazil in latin america in india in places where the incidence is is going up so they can actually show efficacy so and they're not doing it in italy in france in switzerland because they they're incidents i mean they're having some you know new cases but they don't have the levels that they had in in march and april thanks so much nestor very thorough and we i'm i we all appreciate that that very helpful response back to you carla thanks thanks johanna nestor now that you've become a mask expert there are multiple questions on masks two more that i just want to ask so um dr yoda pat was asking what is it about an n95 mask what is it that makes it have such have such good filtration capacity do you do you know i mean what i know it's number one is the feet that those masks are usually tested in you know by the occupational health department and you actually make a really good fit because if you have an n95 but the air goes through the space between your face and the mask there's no filtering the second is actually the filters the filter that they use in the fabric of the mask actually filters uh small particles less than five microns to a very high 95 that's what it's called n95 95 98 filtration so the the filter material and the fact that it's well adjusted to your face is what what does the trick with this type of mask as opposed to others we do not have that filtering capacity and that are not really fitted to your face yeah and i guess my assumption too is that the surgical masks actually that's probably the reason because they're tighter and they they they fit better i i'm not sure because it seems like they're made of from very similar material you're still you're muted nestor sorry so yeah definitely the difference it's mainly on the on the on the way it's adjusted to the face the one with the with the straps or the or the you know the the it are better than just the ear loops which are kind of you know one size fits all right thank you and then there was another question and linda gorgos brought up the fact that we you know in in our offices that we're all using basically procedure masks not surgical masks and is there she said is there um should we be pushing to get surgical mask use in the outpatient setting since it does look at least from that one study that it may be a better may provide better protection what's your thought about that to be honest i i don't know i mean there's a difference i i think between what you can test in a laboratory what you can you can actually measure when you do use these these instruments to measure filtration and the impact in the real life um you know for instance there's a study from one of the hospitals in boston in which they they uh implemented universal masking with procedure mask it was mostly you know the usual procedure masks which are easy to get and there was a significant decrease in the number of healthcare worker infected just with the procedure myself the one thing is the the you know the laboratory measurement of filtration and the other is the impact of wearing a mask uh in the real life and i think you know we are seeing the benefit of even cloth mask surgical mask and all types of mic even being imperfect they do impact the transmissibility of the disease and they do impact the and they protect the user and the people around them even with these limitations thank you um just a question to people or local from here in new mexico about whether we have enough to marla about the we have enough contact tracers and the specific question was do we have enough contact tracers in our state to cover school starting that's a that's a more complicated question i think but marla can you just comment on the contact tracing situation here yeah i don't have the most recent exact numbers um but there have been lots of news reports about it in the last couple of weeks um new mexico continues to hire new contact tracers um kind of in in batches as we bring groups of people on and get them trained and working in the surveillance system so we continue to ramp up the number of contact tracers even though our case counts are going down part of that is in preparation um you know for a future surge in cases as things open up again you know the school question has kind of kind of been put on hold with the governor saying we won't have in-person classes until at least after labor day so that gives us a little more time um to plan how we'll respond to to school cases you know will will one case mean the whole school is closed or just that classroom i think these are still questions um that need to be answered and that districts and superintendents are thinking hard about um you know if kids are back in school and depending how their classroom is set up how much they're moving around um to the cafeteria or library or other common areas the number of contacts they have will increase exponentially so then you're trying to contact trace more families and more kids which will you know require more resources um but we do have um our time down from the time we identify a positive case until we're reaching their contacts uh down to right around 24 hours now so we've definitely become more effective as the workforce has has grown in reaching context of cases more quickly thank you very much marla um there's a question another question came in um about the status of the monoclonal antibody approach i don't know nestor if you can give an update on what we know so far about the submonoclonal antibodies yeah i haven't seen any publication any large trial i have seen more in vitro studies showing the the capacity the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies but i haven't seen any large publication about monoclonals um yet i just want to make a comment on the contract racing and that it's it's so important there was a study actually it's in pre-publication in the metrics uh database from colombia they actually measure the impact this is the first time a group that measured the impact on mortality of contact racing and and they were able to show that a 10 increase in the contact raising capacity decreases the mortality as as for as much as 3.4 let me just to give you an example the dexameters on the famous in recovery study from uk the the change in mortality with dexamethasone was around three percent between those who got it and those who did not get it so so reducing the mortality of three percent with this disease is comparable just giving everybody dexamethasone with just contact racing and the reason is because contact raising decreases tertiary cases so you you have the the index case the person that you investigate and if you intervene you prevent a third wave of cases as a consequence of those secondary cases so so they were able to show that that data in colombia that in the community where they increase contact creation there was a downturn in the in the mortality really really amazing so that's what is so important and i'm glad um that the doh is it's doing that it's really important yeah thank you yeah super important um nestor have you heard anything or read anything recently about the long-term um someone is asking specifically about the taste and smell when people's taste and smell are actually returning if there's some sort of time period that you can talk to patients about yeah there was a story uh about that and in the in the ent literature um i don't recall the exact percentage but in the great majority of patients after two to three weeks they recover the sense of smell there were some that had like a longer lasting uh incapacity but but in the great majority of patients they recover um you know after after a couple of weeks of having the the loss of sense of smell so it seems to be a temporary a temporary event not up nor a permanent damage and there was also a nice paper on on on the mechanism and and this this group also investigated the mechanism and i think i brought in one of the previous updates in which the the cells affect they were actually the support cells not the neurons the neurons that mediate the transmission of the of the of the chemicals you know signals from this from the sense of smell we're not affected but actually the support cells so and those are cells that in theory can recover it can make are like connected tissue cells that can be uh made again or or can be uh substituted and come back so that that was sort of a the explanation why you lose it and then you get it back uh because it's not an irreversible damage of the neurons that that mediate the the olfactory sense thank you nestor i just wanted to mention to everyone that um that the cme linked to cme went into the chat about five minutes ago so please fill that out if you want to see me credit for this session and also just if you have feedback for us we would love to hear it so i'm going to turn it back over to joanna thanks carla um i think i'm just going to take the liberty of asking a question that i'm really interested in hopefully others will too and marla maybe this this might be a question for you i'm super interested to kind of understand better the successes that the navajo nation has had as well as the gallup uh gallup area and mckinley county in terms of really reducing their community spread and wondering uh if you can possibly talk just a minute about that regarding their kind of mitigation strategies was there one thing in particular was it multimodal i do i just answered you in the chat but i think you know it really was a combination of um all the measures so they had very strict um stay-at-home orders and um you know curfews um so i think that was very effective in their specific um locations and helping reduce spread just that very intense um sheltering in place and stay-at-home orders um you know bringing in supports that made that possible for people so that they didn't have to travel um the distances they had been traveling and be out and about as much to make sure the basic needs were getting met lots of testing and contact tracing of course and then you know they also used a lot of alternate care and alternate housing sites for people who needed isolation and quarantine so they actually set up mechanisms for people um to be isolated positive cases be isolated away from their families in hotels and also other alternate care sites and people who needed quarantine also had that available so you know we we often see um household clusters and in most households and especially if crowding is a factor trying to maintain social distance and and make sure that other people in the household don't become infected is quite difficult um just logistically and so i think especially when you have um areas where you have people very tightly um you know densely housed having those options for alternate sites for isolation and quarantine also made a big difference because you were really reducing that household transmission marla i completely agree with you and uh it seems like it and there's i i just recently went on to the navajo department of health website and it looks like they're still having a 9 p.m curfew um every night i don't know if that is is true but it's certainly if if it is so it certainly seems like it's keep it is helping um i wanted to also mention that catherine uh yeah catherine torres says that it is still true that they're having a 9 p.m curfew catherine also says that she agrees with you and also that the um that no one in in that region is is is fighting wearing masks very patient waiting in lines and so it is an amazing kind of a case study of what really can happen when everybody is really following these public health rules um kent knows where the digital librarian put in a a really good interview that i happen to also listen to with jonathan nez the president of the navajo nation um if you have a chance to listen to that um i just wanted to now go to a few other uh questions that we have also um and that is uh um um any association of viral shedding and infectivity um so wondering um master if you might speak uh to that in terms of uh kind of i think what the person writing the question was getting at is perhaps dose of viral shedding and infectivity you kind of hear about you know it's not so much the um the exposure but like the dose of the exposure and the viral shedding might you speak about that right i haven't seen any clear i mean like an association between uh let's say secondary attack rate in in in homes and and viral loading the in the respiratory secretions what we what we have seen or have been published is that um there's a small percentage of people who actually have very very high viral loads and they and this is something hypothetical but the people think that those uh like you know with extremely high viral loads are those who explain this super spreader event how can a single person in fact let's say 10 people in their church or in their you know classroom or or in the summer camp um but it's sort of a lacks association they assume that because there exists these super spreaders events and there are these people who actually carry several logs higher levels of buyer load there's probably a correlation these uh high viral load subjects explain most of the transmission as opposed to that everybody transmits the same that that's what i think the epidemiologists and the modelers actually think that this is happening that a lot of the transmission it's it's it's um produced by a single or a small group not by the general population and that's what the overall uh reproductive number at the beginning of the epidemic was like 2.6 but we know there are people who have infected 14 so so so they are like this super spreader um but i haven't seen a sod in which they actually have correlated you know viral loads with the number of people in your house that became sick something like that like a clear cut and the other thing is that the viral load is actually very dynamic you have a very high viral load two days before the symptoms a couple of days after symptoms and then decays from there so if you if you take this the sample you know well into the disease you may find a very low parallel you you really don't know if that person was a high viral load subject at the beginning of the disease because it's very it's very dynamic that the the battle shedding is a dynamic even it's not something that that is constant through the disease is actually higher at the beginning and then it goes down as symptoms develop the opposite of influenza and some more diseases that you are more contagious when you are symptomatic in this case it seems to be at the beginning more than at the end thanks so much nestor i wanted to see if uh joanna cooper might be able to unmute and just go back to the um the conversation about the navajo nation and other um pueblos in in new mexico to talk about um joanna yeah i work in zuni right um the numbers have been going down but they've decided to institute a a weekend curfew for the month of august from 8 pm friday until monday morning at 5 a.m just to kind of stop it in its tracks it's hard to say if the success came before that or not but um that's what the that's what zunis decided to do great and are you this is joanna again um and dr cooper had the rates been going down um the prior month july we had a we had the surge i would say maybe the second week in july i think our weekly case count was at 95 they are actually my colleague just sent around a graph um so i think we were up to 95 cases in one day it's a small community so that was a significant number but we've been going down since then so that was our peak um through all of these months that was our peak is i think it was the first or second week in july right or maybe it was at the end of june but anyways around around end of june beginning of july was was our peak thanks joanna good to have you hear your voice and catherine do you want to unmute catherine torres and tell us what's and um tell us a little bit about navajo nation uh good afternoon everyone again thank you for this echo it's very valuable to those of us in rural community the navajo nation has finally lifted their weekend curfew to um it's starting at 9 00 pm on saturday and going until monday at 5. you know they still wear masks navajo nation is starting to open up a little bit where they're allowing their employees to come back to work so they've been a little slow on bringing back non-essential until they had enough ppe and other things in place i found that though sage hospital gave out tents so people could be isolated who were positive from their family so they could sleep in a tent and still be close the only thing that has come up which i put in the chat was fort defiance um health board was approached about doing phase three clinical trials for moderna's vaccine so i was wondering if anybody knew anything about that um and if unm's gonna be participating thanks catherine so much nestor do you know anything about that uh any collaboration no i haven't heard any anything and and as far as i know we we're not doing uh vaccine trials here at unm i would love to but we have we don't have any any candidate we're actually looking for a small molecule um for treatment but not for vaccine thank you thank you um nestor um do you have any it's two minutes before the top of the hour i wanted to let everybody know that the cme link did get put in about 40 at about 12 43 i think it should open as soon as our um session does end nestor do you have any last minute um announcements no just thank everybody for the questions and and keep coming back we'll keep reading and bringing the updates as they come and hopefully we'll get good news in some of the trials that are coming absolutely absolutely i did want to remind everybody we have a few other new mexico echoes um and everybody that's not from new mexico is certainly welcome at two o'clock today we have our weekly first responder resiliency echo on thursday mornings at eight a.m we still have our critical care echo with lots of planned uh didactics that's with michelle harkins and every other wednesday we have a nursing home echo carla back to you yeah thank you joanna um and i just wanted to also mention that the nester is involved in two uh spanish-speaking echoes one that's very similar to this it's just started last week it's on thursdays from four to five p.m and also one on monday mornings from nine to ten so um again there's a didactic on the monday a bigger a larger didactic from someone else on the monday echoes so if you're if you speak spanish and would love to come to those we'd love to have you there as well so yeah that's it i think do you you mentioned the the critical care uh that is going to be covered 19 therapeutic update joanna did not mention the topic so the topic for thursdays as uh cobin 19 therapeutic update plasma and beyond so that's thursday and um i think that's it so really really appreciate everyone being here and we will see you hopefully next week,,8/17/2020
17,excited to see everybody my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm and one of the the associate directors at project echo and i'm gonna be facilitating this session with my colleague dr joanna katzman joanna do you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody i'm a neurologist i work alongside carla and um glad to see everybody thank you great thank you joanna um just a couple of housekeeping announcements before we get started um all of you know or most of you know if you haven't been here before that we'd love to see your faces and try build community so please turn on your cameras if you have a camera we would like really love to see you um we will uh we would like for you to just keep yourself muted during the session unless you're called on by one of the facilitators or one of the subject matter experts um but again keep your cameras on if you can if you have any questions during the session please put them into the chat box we would ask that you not answer questions in the chat box and leave that leave that for the hub team members but please ask any questions that you have that we've been having some issues with zoom today this morning there's a lot of technical issues and we were unable to actually pull the the questions from the pre-registration so if you put in a question for pre-registration we may not we won't see it today so you can put but if you have a specific question you can put that into the chat we do have some questions left over from last week that we'll we'll also try to address um i think that's it uh our digital librarian kent will be uh putting a lot of really great stuff into the chat during during the session so please keep an eye on that and we're very excited we have a very robust hub team today um in terms of our subject matter experts so of course we have nestor leslie hayes who's been with us every week in the primary care side we have marla sivers from the department of health and um we uh have carissa colbreath who's the medical director of infectious diseases at tricore lab there have been a lot of questions about lab testing over the last couple of weeks so i'm going to go to them individually and to give if they have an update to give an update and then after everyone's done with their updates we'll go into the questions section so would you like to go ahead and start nestor yeah sure thank you thank you and hello everyone let me just share my screen for today's update and thank you all the the other um participants and everybody who's here today i think it's going to be a great session um let me let me move forward here so the first the first paper that that uh got my attention was this publication on um it's actually 18 uh females that that actually donated their breast milk to be tested for kobe before and after they had diagnosis it was an interesting study they ended up testing um 64 samples from these 18 uh women and only one was positive for for copied and they tried to culture the the virus from that sample and they were unsuccessful so the authors concluded that that um something that we already knew that the risk seems to be very low for transmission and and although there was one positive sample that sample would have no um culturable buyers which was which was reassuring and there there's a figure here they did many cultures and all of these um points data points are are moments where they culture the breast milk the the vertical line is the moment when the when when the diagnosis was done with pcr of the nasopharyngeal sampling and the dark data points are symptomatic moments and the clear are uh asymptomatic moments so you can see the only positive was this blue dot here the patient actually had two positive um breast milk um cultures before she was diagnosed but as i said they were not able to isolate the virus from the best breast milk and the rest of the other 18 or 17 i'm sorry subjects had no no pcr uh no pcr positive in their breast milk so that's sort of uh give us some reassurance uh together with all the all the other papers that that it is um safe to to for mothers who are sars positive or seroscopy too positive to breast feed the babies the the second paper was sort of a of a paper that i like because we we have seen a lot of publications on the high incidence of of kobe 19 in in different races and ethnicity obviously with a disproportionate uh number of cases in in native american in in black uh and hispanic as opposed or compared to white population but in this study was was interesting because they look at the mortality um among different races especially among white and black in 92 hospitals in the united states and the conclusion was that although there was a you know a high proportion of of of non-white uh subjects in in in with the copied epidemic the mortality scene at least in this story seems to be equal among whites and blacks so if you made it to the hospital um your survival was similar uh independent of your race and there's this nice uh kaplan media curve of survival in which you can see that the other races white and black are basically very close together so so that was sort of reassuring to see that although socioeconomic and other factors may may increase your risk of developing coffee that we have discussed uh if you make made it into the hospital and you're treated your survivability is uh comparable no matter what your race is at least according to this paper paper publishing jama the other paper i think leslie is going to comment on but it's an interesting sort of community uh study done in in india and i'm pretty amazed by the number of the numbers of cases and the number of subjects in india so they they compare two different uh moments they have um they have this community workers go into the into the different homes of patients or potential patients in in india in two different moments the first part they visited almost 6 000 homes 30 000 um people in their homes there were 222 positive uh subjects in that population unfortunately 90 of the health workers became infected or had a positive pcr or developed despite using mass despite social distancing they developed infection um uh as a consequence of their their work in this in these communities and then they decided to to put mandatory face shields on this on these workers on their healthcare workers and the second time uh when they visited more than 18 000 homes almost 120 000 persons in those homes uh two thousand positive none of the healthcare workers became infected demonstrating the protective uh efficacy of adding the face shield to the to the usual mask when they when they do their community were really interesting and hopefully leslie will make a comment on that the other interesting paper which is actually in pre-publication but it has been accepted so it's going to be published in one of the oxford university press either um clinical infection disease or journal of infectious disease is this um story out of uh wisconsin and utah on on household transmission of starch kobe 2 in the united states they actually found that that 55 of the household had a a secondary case so almost one in two of the of the house of a patient that was diagnosed in their health system had uh had somebody sick at home and actually the secondary infection rate in the individual home was 29 so one in three um family members within that home became positive as a consequence of the of the infection of the index case and that risk it was it was different depending on who you were within that family like if you were children of those index cases it was 42 percent so two out of five children became uh infected if they were children of the of the index case the spouses were 33 percent one one and three and also they noticed that both diabetes and immunosuppression increase the risk uh significantly the risk of acquiring the infection so it's not only risk of increasing uh increasing severity that we knew from before but also increases the risk of catching the disease or or being infected with an earth ratio of of almost 245 and seven for interesting finding on this story and and this is graphically what they what they what they show if you were if you were a child less than 18 years 42 percent if you were a child more than 18 years still higher than than the average which was 29 35 and so on uh spouses 33 and and there was a difference if if that child was your child or or just not your child if it was your child no matter what the age it was higher obvious the risk was much higher um if it was your child yeah and the highest risk was seen in the 10 to 17 uh age group so that was that was also interesting the other important publication the the ibsa updated on the 18th their uh their guideline on how to use the serologic testing and they keep more or less the same recommendations the infected disease society of america for serologic testing number one in some selected cases patients with high clinical suspicion or a negative molecular test if the test is done after two weeks of symptom initiation not earlier because the sensitivity is less so it can be used in the diagnosis but under those specific conditions number two obviously in children that had uh copied and now present with multi-system inflammatory syndrome and finally something that it's been done on different places for surveillance studies so so those were the indications for for uh the use of solarity testing and overwhelmingly they favor the use of igg not igm or iga or combine igg on igm but i think carissa is here so if you have any question we can address but they they recommend igg um as the preferred uh immunoglobulin to measure and and the indications are are those and finally um there was an interesting this is a bit more complicated but it's it's an interesting another piece of the puzzle for the pathophysiology day and and pathogenicity of the virus they since the beginning of the epidemic as soon as the epidemic left wuhan they identify uh patients with with a specific infection with virus that have a specific deletion of 382 nucleotides so they call it a delta 382 um strain virus and they they investigator here in in singapore actually correlated the clinical um presentation and the complications of the patient if they have just wildlife virus versus this delta 382 this this defective virus that that was missing a piece of of of its genetic material and they found and the endpoint was actually looking at the hypoxia and oxygen requirement and what they discovered was that actually having these delta 382 variant which is actually a piece of the of the open reading frame number eight is missing they found a significantly lower risk of needing oxygen once they developed covey the infectivity was the same um but the severity of disease was the same and this is important because uh we we now we understand that that part of the virus that we haven't really paid that much attention is significant for pathogenicity so um that gives the investigators idea of potential vaccines or or even therapeutic um interventions that can be done to to to affect that portion of the virus that in these viruses is defective defective because of a mutation you can actually either pharmacologically or or somehow use it as a as an immunogen for for vaccines so really interesting this delta 382 deletion and the what they what they think it's it's it's occurring is that that that portion of the of the genome of the body has to do with with uh some interferome antagonists that that are that are produced by by the virus itself so not having that that open reading frame a proteins affects the function of the virus and especially specifically its capacity to antagonize interferon which is one of the natural and donors antiviral that's that's it this is this is basically the conclusions thank you thank you very much nestor um before we go to questions we're going to go ahead and go um to leslie and let's see if you can just reintroduce yourself and you're she's going to share a few slides with us as well hi leslie you're muted okay yeah you're unmuted now okay can you see my screen yeah if you want to just put it in slideshow yes okay perfect okay so um i thought this was kind of cool um flu cases are way down in both australia and south africa um south africa had only one case of flu reported to their national institute for communicable disease normally they have about a thousand i don't know why they actually had so few that seems like a very low number both of them um and australia earlier this summer had actually reported a 99 drop in their cases every article i've read about both of these has said the us should not get excited about this because australia and south africa were much better about social distancing masking and um vaccines but nonetheless it did give me some hope that maybe our flu season would not be quite as bad this year and then i like this one a lot so um this particular article um was a research letter in jama and they looked at almost 3 000 deliveries almost all of the patients were tested for sars cov2 111 were positive 45 were positive before delivery and 66 at the time of delivery so they eliminated patients outside of massachusetts or who didn't have enough data they had 93 cases they compared them with 372 controls and basically they found that if you came into the clinic for visits you were not any more likely to get coveted which is reassuring we can bring patients in and um we're not likely to be giving them coped in the office so whatever we're doing seems to be working and this is just the study that dr sosa already mentioned and um cdc already has you know the face shield on their list of recommended um things to encourage face shields and then this one actually came out in july but i had somehow missed it when it came out and i don't think it's going to be an issue for high schools because as far as i know we're not going to do any sports this fall but i thought it was worth looking at what to do if you have a pediatric patient who comes in for a clearance and they have had cobit basically if they've had mild disease with no fever and less than three days of symptoms they're fine if they have had prolonged fevers bed rest no hospitalization no abnormal cardiac testing then if they're less than 12 you can clear them both because those kids are less likely to have problems and because they're not going to be training as hard the majority of time if they're over 12 they're involved in high intensity sports then you do want to get an ekg if it's normal they're good if it's abnormal then they really need to be evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist if they've had severe symptoms abnormal cardiac testing or if they had um misc then you need to get a lot of cardiac testing and i would refer them to a cardiologist so this definitely is going to apply for anyone who is seeing um college students who are participating in athletics and when eventually we do get back to doing high school sports this is important to remember to make sure we get an ekg for anyone who had anything other than very mild disease oops and this one is really of no use clinically but i just thought this was kind of interesting when i've looked at the graphs of covid cases i've been fascinated by how they go up and down and up and down and up and down and i was trying to remember if i'd seen that for flu or other things and basically this one looked at it and they did all sorts of math that i didn't fully understand and they said indeed there is an oscillation with covet cases they don't know why it's not adequately explained by when we're testing or how we're testing and they did say that as the numbers start disappearing the oscillations get less but like i said there's really no clinical thing that i can come up with from this but i've just noticed that pattern and it was kind of nice to have it proved mathematically it was just kind of interesting and then this last was an article from stat that i really liked and basically they um recommended applying harm reduction to socialization um so they said we've been kind of going with an abstinence-only model for socialization and it's been disastrous especially if you look at the colleges and they said really what we should be doing instead is we should be teaching people how to socialize safely because anxiety and depression are way up in large part because everybody's so lonely loneliness was a huge issue in the country even before cove had hit and it's gotten a lot worse so have people wear a face mask wash their hands stay six other people encourage them to socialize outdoors or if they're going to be indoors they need to have adequate ventilation they should not share food or drinks and then discourage high-risk activities like an indoor credit church service or bars and so i just really like this i think in part i have two college age students who are uh living in the dorms and um uh the one who started already there have already been multiple people kicked out of her college for um not following the rules and i just think if we gave them guidelines on how they should be socializing maybe people would stop doing the large parties and be willing to do things that they can because i think it's important for people to be socializing so so that was all i had thank you so much leslie that thank you especially for that last article i think it's really really important so thank you for sharing that um marla do you have any updates before we go into questions hi good morning um last week we talked about flu season and there had not been a lot um that cdc or the immunization practices advisory council have put out about flu season at that point but then thursday i was on a cdc call that was completely focused on influenza and i'll share the slide deck the link to the slide deck in the chat but some of the takeaways as leslie already alluded to flu activity seems to be down in the southern hemisphere however they caution against you know drawing uh too you have a conclusion from that uh they do note that there are fewer countries reporting um flu activity at all um and it's unclear whether that's because there aren't any cases or because their public health infrastructure is you know stressed that they're not doing appropriate surveillance also um you know people's health seeking behaviors have changed so they caution against drawing a conclusion that we might have a very mild um influenza season the slides that i'll share have a nice table of the influenza vaccines that will be available this season including a new high-dose quadrivalent vaccine for people over age 65 one of the things that they did stress on the call is the importance more than ever this year for influenza vaccine to try to reduce preventable hospitalizations and deaths and you know prevent um the health care system from being overwhelmed and any you know normal flu season hospital capacity is quite strained um by influenza alone and so if you kind of pair influenza with covid um you know that could have really um disastrous effects for the health care system and um they also in this slide deck it's quite extensive they do include some guidelines for people who want to set up influenza vaccine clinics in their practice or in workplaces or other settings they include some guidance for just kind of workflow and patient management and patient flows so those will be in the slides that i share and they have another call coming up it's the clinician outreach call that cdc does on september 17th that's going to discuss um treatment and testing for influenza during this upcoming influenza season so all that'll be in the slide deck and i'll put that in the chat great thank you so much marla chris i don't want to put you on the spot but if you have any updates you want to share that would be great otherwise we'll go into questions but if you'll introduce yourself again as well hi i'm christopher colbreth medical director for infectious disease diagnostics here at tricore um and i think i'll just take the i'll take the questions as they come okay sounds good thanks carissa great so i'm going to turn it over to joanna to start with our questions thanks carla uh thanks nestor thanks leslie marlon uh carissa um i think i might even uh just uh ask you carissa right away um there's a question that came in from martha uh dm rosio it says um she says what do you know thus far about the sensitivity of the antigen saliva strip test so i think i might just uh lead off with that question for you carissa sure i i think this may be referring um i think i saw something on cnn on a sunday morning maybe um about an antigen saliva um strip um so i think that was more of an aspirational discussion um right now there are only three fda cleared antigen-based tests um one there's the bb veritour and the cuadel sophia assays both of those tests have a requirement i believe of less than seven days uh from symptom onset for testing um for uh for those specimens the third one um that was just fda cleared i think last thursday is from a company called lumira dx they're showing a little bit longer uh time for detection with a little bit better sensitivity and they are recommending that test be performed on patients who are less than 12 days from symptom onset all of these assays are from nasal or nasopharyngeal samples there is not currently an fda cleared antigen based saliva test on market and really only three nasal fda cleared antigen-based tests excuse me thanks carissa very much and then dr sebold has a follow-up question to the previous question from martha um he wanted to see if one of the panelists can um can comment on the use of one of abbott's um id rapid nucleic acid test specifically use of that test for screening and also for testing of asymptomatic people without known covet exposure carissa or nestor i can get started on it and then nestor if you want to take it um so the um abbott id now again that test is fda cleared for symptomatic patients um and the performance and the the requirements are almost uh the same as the antigen-based test so it's fda cleared for symptomatic patients and i believe it's symptomatic patients within five or seven days of symptom onset um so screaming of asymptomatic patients it does not appear to be recommended and i don't think the performance of the assay is suitable for that level of screening we've been working on a collaboration with the facility here in new mexico in the region um that has tested over i think it's over 900 um samples um and they sent to tricore um every single result so they tested with the id now and then they sent every sample to tricore um and we currently um are evaluating that data to see where um where we start to lose sensitivity in terms of the cutoff and relating that back to the patient populations what i can tell you is that right now the performance of the test is really for the avid id now it's really best in symptomatic patients that have more virus so symptomatic patients who are earlier in disease tend to have more virus in their nasal specimens later either later in disease or if they are asymptomatic patients um they the virus is lower and the performance of this test is really not suitable um for those patients if you're doing a single um a single test there may be utility for a test that have a lower sensitivity if you can do serial testing of this exact same patient population let's say every two days so you can overcome the issues of sensitivity unfortunately right now there's just not enough supplies to be able to do that type of screening broadly in patient populations thanks carissa nestor do you do you have any follow-up on that or no nothing to have thank you um there's a question from dr cooper um any uh she says any suggestions for patients postcoded but still needing uh having a kind of oxygen requirement a healthy 58 year old male three months post hospitalization still on a liter or two of oxygen but it deciding um to 83 84 while ambulating without oxygen any recommendations um perhaps needing an echocardiogram or pfts any thoughts on that nestor or leslie i just want to give a recommendation i've been trying to find literature on postcode the british medical journal has um has published recently uh a couple of articles on on what they call the long covey they're calling in the uk long covet um so it's interesting they have a guideline for even for for uh you know what to do and what type of rehab to do so i think they're developing material that i highly recommend to just go into the british medical journal and look for the coronavirus information hub and they have their like a position paper on on the long cover then what to do and they have a nice infographic i remember the very colorful infographic uh on how to do but i haven't really uh reviewed it in depth to give a recommendation but i know that that that resource is there for those who are seeing possibilities thank you nestor um and i think uh maybe um kent can maybe put that in in the chat for us there were a couple of questions yeah he did thank you thanks nestor um dr sebold um asks and this might pertain to dr hayes um he asked the return to sport seems to focus on cardiac effects and one he's wanting to know if there's any information on pulmonary effects of return to sports and athletic activity after serious covet covet infection dr hayes have you seen anything about that i have not seen anything i can certainly look um i mean the cardiac ones i think are more worth screening for because those aren't going to show up as much as symptoms whereas if you've got the lung stuff you're going to be more likely either to have a low o2 sat or to feel short of breath whereas the cardiac stuff can show up with no warning in terms of cardiac arrest so okay and a couple people have asked how long is is the current a turnaround time for a testing in in new mexico um i can just tell you personally i had to my family had to go my husband and i and son had to go get testing from press at balloon fiesta yesterday because we're traveling tomorrow and um we haven't gotten the results back but um so i'm not exactly sure but i we we did it a couple weeks ago and it just took uh 48 hours do you um marla do you know what the general turnaround time has been in new mexico for the various facilities you know i think it really is going to depend a lot on region and where you're sending your testing we often get questions the department of health about test turnaround time and you know when we're looking for specific test results they've been sent out to lab core or quest so some out of state reference labs who've been you know quite transparent about their long turnaround times right now so if you've sent your test somewhere like that your turnaround time is generally going to be longer than if it's gone to tripor or the state lab one of the more local laboratories and it's it's sort of varied but i think you know between 48 and 72 hours from the time the specimen arrives at the lab is a pretty typical turnaround time right now thanks marla um i'm wondering if dr saltman might want to un unmute and ask his question about sewage effluent if he's available to unmute yes thank you thank you joanna and thank you everybody let me just take an opportunity since i've been here several weeks thank you all the panel of experts for being so expert and really educating everybody on these calls about this it's just been great so my son's school sent out an email that said they were going to test the sewage effluent and i guess that's downstream from the dorms and they think that's going to be some sort of pathway to case finding and i know that's done for some other sorts of infectious disease but is there you know i guess the ques the two questions one one would be what test what what test would be done would you use for covid for that testing and how effective do you think that would be as a strategy for for mitigating the problems on a college campus thank you marla nester who wants to take this one i would say a little bit about it nestor i don't know if you um have read much about this but there is a national wastewater surveillance system project through cdc i see that that's been added to the chat and my understanding of the purpose of doing this surveillance is um really to provide an early signal early detection um that you may have uh coronavirus circulating in the community um so it's certainly um you know not a diagnostic tool um but i've read some information that you know detecting an increase in um virus in wastewater can be an early signal giving you sometimes uh three to five days warning that you're going to have sort of a peak of clinical cases and so it's used as more of an early detection system for public health surveillance that might give you a clue that you need to be doing more testing of a community or a population or preparing for a surge in new cases i think for methodology it's usually done by molecular testing so pcr uh doing a pcr on the sample very interesting dr saltman where is what state is your son in in college uh it's in portland in oregon wow fairly interesting thanks for that great question um i know that they've used this and are planning on using this um for some correctional facilities that have a dedicated wastewater treatment plant so i've read some information about that as well it's great i might ask as a sort of follow-up how do you think how do what do you think of that strategy compared to pooled testing you know with optimal optimal sample size of pooled testing for the prevalence in the population this is joanna i was almost going to say it's kind of like pool it's kind of like a variation of pooled pool testing ex right what are your thoughts marla or nestor carissa i mean i think one advantage is it's a passive surveillance system people don't have to go and be swabbed and get tested so i think it has some advantages especially if you're talking about a large asymptomatic population doc thanks dr saltman uh dr siebel are you available to unmute and ask your uh question uh maybe for dr sosa about uh the deletion study i'm sure it might be a little bit louder i'm out on fire the helicopter just landed behind me here uh i'm trying to show you guys in that background so there's ash and smoke blowing past me in the helicopter noise i hope you can hear me yes so um in terms of the study uh you referred to the deletion study dr sosa does that imply that we might have a therapeutic use and or is that an unrelated study or an unrelated implication for interferon right no it's interesting i think it adds to the to our knowledge base i mean we have to i and i presented a couple of weeks ago that paper from the netherlands in in which they found these uh two families unrelated families who had like a uh mutation in in in one of the total writing sectors that have to do with the activation of interference or production of interference and that and they they have a very they had a very severe uh disease course despite being really young and they have been other other other indications of this relationship between the interferon so this is another piece of information that the interesting aspect is that this is not a problem in the in the immune system but actually in the virus so you know the authors obviously speculate the possibility of of uh making a vaccine for instance yeah i can see the helicopter so making a vaccine um with that deletion for instance that it would be a an attenuated virus and the other thing is to find and they have already studied uh human proteins that actually interact with that open reading frame a so so hopefully they will find some um therapeutic uh molecule that can actually that can actually affect the function of that open reading frame uh or that part of the genome of the virus it's very early it's just the first time that they actually describe because this mutation had been described before in wuhan china in taiwan but nobody had actually looked at the clinical history of the patient and compared the outcome they were able to compare the outcome of patients who had this mutation with others who didn't and they found this striking statistically significantly uh lack of of of need of oxygen so so they they had pneumonia they were infected they were in the hospital but surprisingly they didn't die and they didn't have the oxygen requirement of the other patients uh with with non-uh mutation and apparently once you get it that's another finding i didn't go into detail but they found patients that had like a mixed population they have the infection was um they were they had the wild type and the and the delta 382 and when they follow this patient doing the genomics they found that the the delta 382 became the dominant strain in the in in their in their secretions you know there are really several interesting finding in this in this um preliminary communication uh unfortunately this is not the dominant strain all over the world it's it's actually not but it's at least a proof of concept that that a defective virus can can have a milder disease and we can find ways to attack this protein and not just the spike protein which is what we've been uh concentrating with the convalescent plasma and the monoclonal antibodies and even some of the drugs that are trying to inhibit the attachment of the virus these are completely different intracellular protein or group of of proteins thank you very much nestor i'm going to ask a couple of questions at this point leslie thank you so much for um giving that information about adolescents returning to sports there's a question in the chat about whether there's something available like that for adults or even older adults do you know of anything i'm sure there is i haven't seen it i will look it up and uh talk about it next week yeah do you also just want to mention what you just put into the chat too for those of you who didn't read it just about the pulmonary effects so i just did a quick google search um and it turns out a lot of places are seeing really significant pulmonary effects in athletes and they said if they have symptoms or had severe disease that needs to be the first place you focus your rehab is on pulmonary rehab so thank you very much i'm going to go to a question that was actually sent by email dr tempest do you can you unmute yourself and ask your interesting question about aggregate um living situations i know i think you're on there you are bruce can you unmute yourself yeah there we go perfect thank you yeah maybe well the the question came up about people living in aggregate living arrangements uh you know it's largely elderly people um and i'm one of them but they frequently live in places where there's also licensed assisted living in memory units nursing units and they've been requesting testing for cobot for both the independent residents and for the staff who take care of them but so far it's been turned down the reason being that there were insufficient supplies to do it so the question i was asking is that is that still a problem i thought since people from tricor and things were here and uh if if it still is a problem uh would pooled sampling be an alternative but i think there's a real desire there's a number of these aggregated living communities around the state and so it involves quite a few people there have been some outbreaks in the licensed areas the licensed areas are getting routinely tested but the independent people living within the same units buildings are not being tested it would seem like this was a particularly high risk group great thank you that's a great question um marlon maybe you can approach it from the epidemiological standpoint and then carissa you could talk about just the volume of testing and what the turnaround is at this point marla go ahead um yeah i've heard this question come up a couple of times and i know that the um perspective from aging and long-term services department who's leading the testing response in long-term care and um phd which is the the clinical staff is you know part of their testing plan um has been it's not only a laboratory supply issue but a human resource and personnel capacity issue to go out and do those large-scale testing events and their hope has been um that people who are living in independent living could access community-based testing resources rather than having um you know a mobile unit come on site to do large-scale testing for um you know several hundred people so that's been their hope how to approach it and i think um you know it's largely um a workforce supply issue um you know beyond just a testing capacity issue could i add something to that the the people living here living in these places independently frequently have issues with mobility and other things in terms of getting around it makes a lot more sense to test on site and these places also have personnel who could test do the testing and actually have have agreed in the past to do the testing so uh i i think that's an issue that could be gotten her around what has been said has largely been the issue of supply but taking a large group of people like this and moving them to some other independent citer saying well if you have a chance go and do it many people can't drive cars don't have cars etc so i think you can see the problem yeah thank you dr tempest very very um helpful information carissa do you want to can you speak about the testing itself yeah you know i mean i think um trying to find opportunities to be able to increase testing capacity through pooled testing particularly in um lower risk populations um is is a way that we can be able to increase the coverage of our testing but as marla i think really astutely mentioned is that there's so many other factors in addition to the actual testing supply capacity um the personnel capacity and accessibility to testing is certainly a priority and then in the laboratory the physical act of just pooling the specimens um and and then deconvoluting those pools for resulting um present additional challenges um but i do think bruce raises an important issue around accessibility and increasing the accessibility of testing to more populations particularly the high-risk populations and i think that's something all of us can continue to be mindful of as we're looking at our planning for just how to continue to control the spread of the virus through testing thank you carissa i just want to let everyone know that the cme link just went into the chat if you're interested in getting to see me please fill that out and we would love to also have your feedback um unless i'll ask one more question then back to joanna um nestor can you lynn colemeyer is asking for an update on post covered neurologic symptoms and adults without pre-existing symptoms can you can you speak to that yeah i haven't i haven't really seen much lately i mean we know that that there have been publications on the duration of an osmia and this great iguacia and also as part of this post covered on long copy uh there are some issues with like cognitive abilities like capacity to concentrate et cetera so but i haven't really seen much uh detail on that i don't know if joanna can make a comment to that regard but i i've seen just the general sort of cognitive symptoms you know people feel fatigued unable to to um to concentrate and and general symptoms like that that accompanies this postcard uh and i've seen in the literature also chronic fatigue syndrome being described or associated after kobe which include obviously uh some decrease in the intellectual powers of the of the person in this fatigue state or i i agree nestor thank you yes the the symptoms are definitely lingering whether it's cardiac pulmonary neurological had i've seen a lot of post covert headaches cognitive issues i i think uh we're just beginning to see uh see all these symptoms thanks carla um it's leslie hayes one other thing is ptsd there's a fair amount of ptsd among people in general who've had any medical crisis and i think cobit in particular because of the stigma and because of the fact that you don't know if you're going to be just fine or you know dead in seven days it's i think there's a huge amount of ptsd associated with it i think thanks leslie um i'm going to take over from carla thanks carla i did want to get to a question from carol miller um from one of the pre-registration questions i'm gonna look for that up here um actually carol are you able to unmute yes i can hi hi there yeah my my question is specifically what new mexico is what data are we collecting about long haul or ongoing symptomology and problems after people have tested negative because there's you know the few international studies that dr sosa and dr hayes have referenced but are we collecting anything here specific where our population has a lot of different characteristics like high native american hispanic and other so uh that's basically my question thank you thanks carol and it kind of relates to what we've just been talking about marla is the state collecting is is there kind of a data bank collecting any kind of post covet uh symptoms of any sort over there is not a project currently underway um with the new mexico department of health that i'm aware of but there might be um some other private entities that are doing their own work around that uh thanks marla um thanks carol i'm just gonna go um to some other uh questions here too um um so let me just uh bear with me for a second um this is also from carol miller she asked some what follow-up is recommended for post uh postcode coveted morning sputum uh occasionally with blood um carissa or nestor can you can you perhaps um help to answer this i mean i haven't seen any any specific literature to that to be honest i as i said i haven't really dived deep into into uh into postcard syndrome i think i might just based on the number of questions that we are accumulating and now we are focusing on on this postcode thing but i mean i would prefer i mean from a practical standpoint i would definitely uh you know refer this patient to a pulmonary doctor maybe get an x-ray to see if they they have persistent infiltrate etc but i i mean aside from just common sense practice i haven't really reviewed anything about uh hemoptysis after kobe or what what will be the reason and what to do with that i will be concerned with things like like uh pulmonary embolism obviously uh which has been described with with these type of patients and even strokes uh but i would just evaluate him holistically i mean do a chest x-ray a good physical uh start to quantify the the the hemoptysis uh if if they had an x-ray in the hospital try to compare the x-ray during the hospitalization and and now on a new x-ray to see if there's a new infiltrator or something i would just do you know do a complete evaluation and if i have any questions just refer them to to a pulmonary to for pulmonary function tests or see if they need to do anything else like a bronchoscopy etc thank you nestor um i'm also wondering there's a question that came in and it's it's kind of been uh across you know the weeks it's uh there's been some questions related to kind of um preventing more serious illness later down the road if people do get a covet and the question is should women taking estrogen who test positive be told to stop taking their estrogen kind of to prevent the more serious you know vascular side effects are clotting um you know pulmonary clots things like that and i just want to know nestor has there been any changes regarding guidance um for uh for women regarding uh you know women in estrogen and clots or perhaps using using anti-platelet agents things like that no that i'm aware of i haven't seen any specific like uh instruction towards the dc in the the estrogens uh it's a good idea to to try to to stratify the patients and and see if they're the thrombosis risk overall i mean if it's a patient with like immobility and or some other risk factors like underlying cancer and on top of that they have copied i would be very uh concerned about the possibility of thrombosis but i haven't seen really any specific guideline saying you have to stop estrogen uh in in a in a patient that is taking them great leslie hayes i will mention on a copic group i'm on on facebook a healthy 35 year old female physician got coveted and she was on birth control pills fairly mild and two weeks later had a pulmonary embolism and she said she so regrets not having stopped her birth control pills so i think it is something i would at least discuss with every patient because um this um particular position really was you know kind of beating herself up over it so great um thank you leslie very much um nestor i i had to step out for a second when during the powerpoint and i might have missed it but i don't know if you commented regarding the fda release of approving convalescent plasma today and if you want to discuss it a little bit more yeah no i i did not i was going to leave it for next monday because i saw it yesterday but i review i review the the the approval and and there are actually a couple of papers that have been published and we'll review it next week but they they're the group by the mayo clinic by dr joyner and casa de val actually published um a meta-analysis in which they found a decrease in the they did like an edition of all the papers that have been published and they found that mortality was decreased by 57 in a meta analysis they also had a safety study where they that they published or people probably with 5 000 patients and they found very few serious adverse events and then on top of that there was this uh also paper which is the in preprint with the 30 30 000 plus patients who receive um convalescent plasma under the the authorization that they got from from fda and they publish their results and they found two important things number one is that that it needs to be given earlier there was a clear difference in in the survival benefit if you gave the plasma less than three days as opposed to more than four days and they also check the levels of the antibodies in the plasma and those who receive plasma with very high levels of antibody uh had uh a better outcome than those who who got plasma with very low or intermediate levels of antibodies so i think with all of that information um and it's actually the detail in the fda uh authorization they decided to give give you know the the emergency authorization for plasma as a and they and they actually put on quotes may be effective as a therapy that may be affected they don't have all the data they don't have a large control randomized control trial that actually proved beyond any doubt that this is this is an uh therapy but they have this indirect evidence from the open label mayo clinic study from the meta-analysis from some of the chinese early early trials um and that's the conclusion that it may be effective seems to be safe but now they have a very large number of people who have received the plasma and and and the the obviously the the the adverse events are very few uh compared to the total of people who have received it and and not unexpected things like volume overload some people have like the trolley their lung inflammation but there's like no not really a big signal with like antibiotic enhanced disease or something of the of the more uh fearsome consequences i think the plasma is gonna you know it's gonna be useful but i think what we are learning from plasma is also going to be used with the with uh with the monoclonal antibodies and it's going to move ahead the monoclonal antibodies and i actually saw an announcement that they're starting a trial one of the one of the companies that is producing monoclonal are going to start in nursing homes as a prevention as a sort of a passive immunity they're going to give the monoclonal to to residents of nursing home and follow them and see if they're protected from from the from outbreaks in nursing homes when they use these so it's i think it's interesting and and i think people are going to go back to use more convalescent plasma with this authorization but it still may work we don't we don't have enough certainty right and and nestor just to follow question do we have i mean do we you know i see billboard you know that on the freeway we need your plasma we need your plasma do we have enough um you know do we are we going to be able to make enough uh plasma with high you know with high levels of neutralizing antibody over yeah that i don't know i mean we haven't used that much we published our experience with the first 13 patients and it was very disappointing because we found uh that a lot of the plasma that we were transfusing had no uh very very low levels so it was really ineffective uh and we actually um are at this point with this emergency authorization actually communicating with our transfusion experts here at unm and see if they can they can talk to vital land to get uh plasma that is rich in antibodies and just not just like any plasma but having trying to do like a selection of the of the donors of selection of the plasma and use really the high um high levels of antibodies uh as opposed to to any any any convalescent plasma because that that's what seems to be the conclusion of this study from the mayo clinic that you need to be more selective um when you when you are going to use the plasma and select those that have very high levels otherwise you you're not transfusions on there it's going to decrease mortality and may may run into adverse events thank you nestor i just wanted to let you know that dr colemeyer in spokane says that just reminds us that thermobotic risk concerns for cova 19 also applies to men with on testosterone with hypogonadism and her practice her endocrinology practice um really supports continuing hormone replacement for both men and women who need it with suspected copin 19 so they're not stopping it uh who need um who need the continued hormone replacement i just um we just have a couple of minutes left and i just wanted to see if our panelists have any last minute items to share um and carla do you have any last-minute items to share for our for for all of our participants and who we so appreciate um no i don't think so i just i don't you want me to give the reminders joanna yes yeah so thanks everyone for joining we really appreciate it um again if you if you would like to see me please please go ahead and fill out that link in the chat just a reminder for those of you who attend the critical care cover 19 echo that michelle harkins does um there will be no clinic this week on september in september we're going to move to just the first and the third thursday so the next critical care tele echo session will be on september 3rd and just carla just wanted to give a couple other reminders our first responder echo is continuing on a weekly basis and that's at two o'clock every monday um great thank you very much and um just i wanted to yeah thank very much all of our experts here chris is really nice to have you here from tri-core we we'd love to have you every week or whenever you can and thank you leslie and nestor for all of your um expertise and we will see you all again on monday yeah and thanks to all of our uh participants you all make it part worthwhile and why we're here so thank you bye-bye bye one o'clock so i have to run over to mlk so but everything went by and ultimately carla i'm not going to be here next week okay okay bye no problem yeah thanks toronto bye elena do you need anything from me um i don't i'll catch you,,8/24/2020
18,everyone and welcome to the coveted 19 infectious diseases office hours it's really nice to see everybody today my name is carla thornton and i'm an infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i'll be facilitating this session today um i'm going to just have a couple of quick housekeeping announcements before we get started as you guys know we would love for those of you who have not been on before we always ask people to turn on their cameras if they have one because we would love to see you we feel like this being able to see each other actually helps to build build our community of practice so thank you for turning your cameras on if you have any questions during this session please put them into the chat box and we will try to answer as many as we possibly can hopefully we'll get to all of them if you um we also ask that you refrain from putting answers into the chat answering those questions yourselves in the chat box because we'd like for the the answers to come from the hub team members um in addition please keep yourself muted during the session unless you're called on by one of our uh one of our hub team members so i'm going to go ahead and get started uh one other thing actually as you all know kent nordsworthy our digital librarian puts lots of really interesting information in the chat and whenever one of the an article is referenced the link will be in the chat so please keep an eye on that as well so without further ado i'm going to introduce our hub team um marla sivers our epidemiologist from the department of health unfortunately can't make it today so if there are any purely public health questions we may defer them for a week we'll see if nestor and leslie know the answers but we may defer some of them um and i don't believe that carissa is on yet um carissa cobra hopefully you'll be joining us from tri-core labs so we'll go ahead and get started with um uh nestor sosa who's our chief of infectious diseases has some information to share with us and after him leslie hayes who's our other tub team member today will share some slides with you as well so nestor can you introduce yourself and go ahead sure give me just one second to set this up and hi nestor can you can you say something yes can you hear me can you guys hear me um we can't hear you i hear you i can hear him fine too oh thank you i heard you sorry i couldn't hear you because i had my mind turned down yeah can you hear me i can hear you sorry everyone else could have heard you could hear you before okay let's go through the update for this august my name is nestor sosa i'm the division chief here at unm infectious disease division chief at unm so first i i wanted to start with uh with this announcement from the fda the fda uh actually uh gave an emergency use authorization to convalescent plasma and i wanted to go over a couple of the most uh recent papers with convalescent plasma to to um to put this approval in in perspective so first of all uh as you know the from the beginning of the epidemic here in the united states there was this group uh uh from the leaders from from mayu clinic they actually started a um an emergency authorization protocol in which they actually um help a lot of health centers throughout the united states to use convalescent plasma and and collect some of this information prospectively so it was sort of a um a mix of compassionate use with with a protocol and they uh publish or actually pre-publish because it's still in in the in the pre-publication phase but they they release the manuscript of their uh the first three months of this large really large um collaborative uh study in which they actually uh got information from over 35 000 patients uh with kobe 19 who that were treated uh with with um with convalescent plasma and there were some interesting results of these of this analysis first of all the seven-day mortality rate was less 8.7 percent versus 11.9 in those who received the treatment early and they defined early less than three days from admission as opposed to four or more days which was classified as late so they did fine and this difference between 8.7 and 11.9 was statistically significant so so the first important finding from this large um cohort of patient that had been treated um was that that sooner uh was associated with with the sooner that was associated with less mortality the other the other finding is better seen in the in the next slide with uh with actually the graph the other the other um aspect of this trial is that they measure the antibodies present in the plasma and and according to the to the amount they classify it as high a high concentration of of antibody against uh cytoscopy ii medium level and low level and you can see that for those who received the treatment at three days the seven day mortality was significantly uh better with the high concentration compared with the low concentration so so from this study we can clearly see that number one giving the the treatment early uh it's better and also a transfusion a plasma that has a high concentration is much better than than a plasma with low concentration so so obviously these two um aspects argue in favor of of uh of um benefit associated with with plasma because you can see those uh response um relationship between within between decreased mortality and high higher levels of antibody and this was also valid at the i'm sorry at the at the 30 day point so so they look at the seven-day mortality and 30-day mortality and they saw this the same dose response curve and more benefit earlier than late which is defined as i said more than four days um so those were the conclusion there was a relationship between reduced mortality and and using the plasma early and having the plasma a higher concentration of antibody the other the other information that was obtained from from this collaboration was the safety and they actually published um in clinical medicine the the the experience of the first thousand patients that receive the plasma and you can see that a serious adverse event related to plasma were really really infrequent point zero eight percent for for general mortality uh immediately after the plasma there were some transition related but look the percentage are really very low 0.14 0.22 so really really a safe and apparently safe um administration of the plasma for for this and these were relatively sick patients all of them hospitalized a large percentage uh in icu so so having very few advanced events is reassuring um so that that was good and in fact when if if you review the document in the in the fda approval they actually review data from 20 000 patients and again the incidence of of serious adverse events like transfusion reaction less than one percent thromboembolic event less than one percent cardiac event three percent so so really relatively a small adverse event given the the clinical conditions of the patient so so with this this evidence the the plasma was um recommended by by the um by by the fda obviously i have seen comments especially in social media and some podcast people criticizing the fda because we don't have a really large control randomized story that prove the safety and efficacy of plasma but with that we have all these um you know indirect evidence from also from a meta-analysis another another small study that showed that it's probably effective and and and seems to be safe the other important um important news and publication that we saw i think over the last week was the this report of uh of the reinfection and they have published the case of reinfection from hong kong they publish in clinical infection this is for those who want to go uh in depth in this um in this description and and there's another case uh in reno nevada which hasn't been published but it was communicated to the press and and this second clear clearly documented reinfection cases uh is a young person in their in their 20s who actually had a more severe disease the second time around so so it was even more or a little bit more worrisome than this hong kong report in which the second infection was essentially asymptomatic in the case of the renal nevada person the second infection was uh actually more symptomatic than the first one and it was a young a young male so at least we have two clear clear uh evidence of this reinfection and there's also some cases in belgium and and netherland that have been also communicated uh so we have to wait for the final publication but i think this phenomenon as we have commented before it seems to occur now we have more than one report and and um although it seems to be infrequent so far but it's something that we need to follow this risk of reinfection because this impacts obviously the duration of immunity the meaning of immunity and it has also some relevance for for the vaccines i mean if we're going to have uh the spy vaccination we're going to have people uh becoming infected and then it it's a it's a it's an issue but i think it's too early to reach any any solid conclusion these are a couple a handful of cases against many millions of cases that have been seen with kobe in the world and i wanted to revisit the long covered last week you guys asked me a lot of questions on on postcovet syndrome long coverage syndrome and i cited uh the british medical journal i i obviously i i don't expect you to see this this super heavy infographic but this is what they produce in the in the uk in this article that actually review uh what we know which is not a lot but we know some about this postcode how to approach it so they they actually came up with a definition they said they suggest like if symptoms persist for more than three weeks uh you should consider this long covey or vodskovic syndrome and then they give here what to evaluate the different you know clinical evaluation the laboratories that are necessary so i really invite you to look at this publication the british medical journal uh who actually um goes into into detail and if you can print this very nice very colorful uh if you if you see patients in the post copy phase uh it gives you some help and what to do how to evaluate the you know when to refer them to respiratory especially to cardiology to anaerobic obviously this is this is uk center but i think it's it's applicable um to the united states and in fact on thursday morning at 8 30 a month in time there's going to be a webinar by the briefing medical journal exactly about this topic um so for those who have you can join uh and it's all the information is in the brilliant make a journal there are they're gonna discuss post code because they have these authors have been studying this uh aspect of postcard in depth so i invite you to listen to that webinar if you really want to go deeper into this postcode um syndrome that we are discussing and we have been uh you know answering questions about for for now several weeks uh finally one paper in the in the in the new england journal was reported about the use of saliva and this this looked very promising they actually compared saliva with nasopharyngeal in this nashville sampling this study and doing pcr and they found that saliva was definitely not inferior or in some cases slightly better in detecting uh the the virus at least in these uh in this uh relatively small sample but it's something that i think it's gonna simplify the the the testing so so it's something to follow and and maybe if if karisa is here later we can we can ask her but it's you know there's more evidence accumulating that we probably don't need to do not so far in yield um going forward once we have this approved and and adequately uh um validated in in our in our labs and the and the other thing that i want to mention i i almost forgot that i included this this slide there was also some controversy regarding the cdc and and it's a pity that marla is not today because they get the cdc modified their testing criteria and they're actually not recommending or or at least yeah not recommending um tests for asymptomatic individuals that have been in contact with with uh with uh with a patient or a person with kobe and it was this was also made a lot of noise in the in the in the press and in the in the social media because not everybody agrees with this recommendation from the cdc in which they actually said you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or a healthcare provider and and before we we you know we were we were doing tests for those who were exposed to to copy 19 and now they reverse or they change their recommendations so it's an interesting and controversial recommendations from from cdc that have really uh uh given uh receive a lot of criticism for this i think that was that was it for today thank you let me start sharing there you go i think you're muted carla sorry about that um thank you nestor uh there are a couple of questions for you but i think i'll go to leslie first and have her do her update um leslie can you introduce yourself and please share your slides with us thank you all right leslie hayes let me see if i can do this properly today do you guys see my slides um not yet there's okay great leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine now central primal health and espanola and the first one is just people last week i had talked about the testing you should do for pediatrics and people had asked if there was a grown-up version and i found this i could not find anything more recent than may i don't know if there's anything out there i was actually glad i looked this up because i was a little shocked at quite how much work up they recommended even for people with just symptoms they basically said while you have symptoms no exercise at all and then you need to do two weeks of convalescence afterwards and then um they recommended and there was nothing in there distinguishing between sort of the person who does you know a mile walking a day with some stretching versus somebody who's training for an olympic marathon but they said before you return to activity you should get a troponin a 12 lead ekg and an echocardiogram which um like i said i was a little surprised by quite how much they recommended and then if they're hospitalized they actually recommend it even more and you can look at the information but like i said i was actually a little surprised by quite how much they recommended and then this was um speaking of the long covid they this was a study out of um france and they um had 279 patients um and they ended up surveying 120 of them and the mean was 110 days so almost four months and at that point over half were still fatigued um 40 still had shortness of breath loss of memory concentration and sleep disorders were you know roughly 30 percent hair loss was quite common and patients were on the ward versus in the icu had really no statistically significant differences and um 46 of them had been workers prior to being hospitalized and at the time of the survey which was four months afterwards only two-thirds had actually gone back to work and about three-fourths had been able to resume activity um but less than half had been able to resume of full physical activity so um obviously it's going to be different for outpatient patients who are solely in the outpatient world but i was it was pretty significant long-term symptoms for those who were hospitalized and then uh again a very low risk of transmission in the healthcare setting in this particular study um they um had 226 patients who were exposed to copin 19 positive healthcare workers this was from march through june so for a lot of them either the healthcare worker or the patient or both were not masked um about halfway through the study they started requiring healthcare workers to be masked and a little bit later started requiring the patients um and out of those 253 exposures there was only one patient who was possibly infected after being exposed to an infected physician and that was a 30 minute outpatient visit during which neither was masked physician was not symptomatic develop symptoms later so it was reassuring again that we can see patients in the office and then this was kind of an interesting one they um had 33 000 children who were tested um at 28 hospitals for sars kobe 2 through may 29th um and a lot of them were tested for pre-op others were just asymptomatic for various reasons and the prevalence ranged from zero percent to 2.2 percent and the only thing that really affected how likely the kids were to be positive was how prevalent the virus was um in the community nothing else really seemed to have an effect on that so and then this last one i just wanted to mention this has been showing up on social media and i don't know why this suddenly appeared that it's this huge thing oh the cdc updated the coveted number to admit that only six percent of all the deaths actually died from covet well this is not news they've been updating it with this every week and a lot of the comorbidities are actually things like respiratory failure and pneumonia but what i have seen several people saying is basically that these deaths don't count because the people had chronic illnesses and i think this is something that we as healthcare providers really need to sort of fight back against there's this idea that somehow you know the deaths don't really count if people were already sick and i think there's an incredible amount of stigma around having a chronic illness anyway and this is making it much worse and also kind of implying that you know these folks are on the verge of death anyway whereas many of us have patients with hypertension who've had hypertension for over 40 years so i really encourage you to fight back against this if you see it on your social media feeds because i think this is an extremely dangerous message to be getting out there so and that is everything i have thank you so much leslie um lastly i just want to introduce carissa colbreath she's an infectious diseases uh medical director infectious disease at tricore laboratories and carissa i think you're having some trouble with your video but did you have any um any updates for us before we move into the questions um no no updates um i'm expecting uh a few questions i'm sure okay great thank you carissa so um let's nestor there's a couple questions about convalescent plasma and dr fred fox i don't know you i think you have uh video and audio can you unmute yourself and just ask your question about the paper that the investor presented or the information that he presented yes um when i dr sosa when i read the paper there were and i'm sorry i don't have the charts in front of me there were quite a few of the results that had confidence intervals that overlapped which to me meant that i was less impressed with the differences they were touting can you comment yeah i think i i heard your question no i agree i agree totally with you uh remember this is an open uh story no not really comparison group they actually only enroll patients in the in the convalescent plasma and the conclusion that they can that they can reach are are somewhat uh weakened by that fact i mean and that's what they they they do see like a ghost response but you're right if you see even in the graphic that i show you can see that the intervals are are overlapping so there was no uh you know absolute uh you know certainty of this difference it was a it was a trend towards that difference both for early and for a high high level but there was some overlapping you're absolutely right and that's why uh the decision by the fda has been criticized because they we're still waiting for a large uh you know power uh power story that showed convolution plasma against a decent placebo shows uh really efficacy so that's that's that's a valid comment and you're absolutely right there is some overlapping in some of the some of the confidence intervals thank you nestor um can you also comment correct tim asked in the pre-registration questions about the current status of convalescent plasma at unm and plans for future research yeah i i mean we we did a study early uh in in the epidemic uh we actually published it in the journal of infectious disease our first 13 patients uh that received convalescent plasma and we were very disappointed because we we couldn't uh really i mean we measured the neutralizing antibodies in the in the transfused plasma and and most of the units were very low there was very very low levels of antibodies and now this new study basically confirms our concern and and in fact when we transfuse the patients we didn't see a significant change in the convolution i'm sorry in the neutralizing antibody levels pros transfusion actually nine of the of the 12 patients that ended up completing the study uh had no change in their in their neutralizing antibody only one to one increase and two are decreased so so it was really a negative uh study and we stopped using the convolution plasma after that point uh waiting for really using a plasma that has a guarantee high levels of antibody number one and number two trying to use it early i know dr j raval which is one of the authors of this original paper and his transfusion medicine is going to start with the university of vanderbilt a trial of convalescent plasma neutral with convalescent plasma but this is going to be randomized uh control and hopefully they will i haven't seen the protocol but i think they're going to include antibody levels and and it's going to be much more or a better a better design than the emergency use that we we did at the beginning of the epidemic so so we are going to gather more information from from the use of compilation plasma in a better in a better design story thank you um and kim joy up and espanola asks i think chris of this may be for you will new mexico start using the avid 15-minute cova test or can you give any information about the test accuracy etc sure so in addition or maybe just after the abbott test was announced the binax now that also has the app that's available a significant portion of that um test volume was purchased by the government and so at this point when we've reached out to inquire about getting access to that um it's been limited on what's available commercially um i don't know if marla has any details on how that federal purchase would be allocated to states um and and how new mexico may be impacted but right now it's just not going to be commercially available um for at least a few months um for a laboratory like tri-core or maybe even a doctor's office to be able to make purchases what we know about the performance is that it's again recommended for individuals who are symptomatic within the first seven days of symptoms and abbott is doing some further evaluation to see if there's any ability to use this test in asymptomatic populations but i think the availability is going to be a challenge and i don't know if marla has any information about what the state may receive for use here in new mexico thank you chris marla unfortunately can't be on today but we can ask her that um possibly next week um can you just talk a little bit more about the test itself um you're talking you're can you just just just a little bit more detail about those who have don't know much about it sure so it's um it's the abbott uh binax now with the antigen antigen-based tests many if those primary care providers have probably used the binax now for stress or flu or any other target and so um it's an antigen based lateral flow assay um abbott does have um i haven't seen how the app interface works but there's a phone app apparently that you would be able to get your test results delivered to your phone but i haven't seen exactly how that works in collaboration with your provider again the package insert demonstrates decent performance compared to molecular tests where we're looking i think for antigen tests again in symptomatic patients when there's going to be a lot of virus present and early in disease where there'll be a lot of virus present that's the appropriate specimen and that's that's about all that that's available right now it just came on the market like i said um and and really before there's been an opportunity to do many um like independent studies outside of what abbott did for their eua those reagents have been um already purchased and sequestered thank you very much um nestor go ahead yeah i wanted to have carrissa any follow up on the saliva because i i i mean there was this publication by jail about this new uh way to measure saliva and now this this publication also that i presented in the england journal of using saliva just as a as a source for the pcr for the for the regular pcr but are we any closer to using saliva here in in in your lab in tricor in the near future because i know you have been working on that front a few months ago yes yes so we have validated um saliva as a source and we saw similar data to what was published that saliva has the best performance earlier in disease but not later in the disease course the challenge that we face is that um saliva still requires some pre-processing before we can put it onto our instruments and so it's and it does not it requires the exact same test reagents that we use for everything else so it doesn't really increase our testing capacity which is one of our big goals right now is to be able to perform more tests and the performance is basically equivalent to the nasopharyngeal swab which we seem to have um we have enough i think right now nasopharyngeal swabs so we're trying to find the best place for the test and how to support utilization um so um we might need to call you and work on some plans for that nester about how and when to use saliva compared to other testing methods thank you krista there's a couple more questions um about testing doug clark was asking about the sensitivity the abbott rapid antigen test i'm not sure if you you said that already but can you repeat it if you have said it i don't have the exact numbers um but i think it you know it was kind of demonstrating adequacy um compared to um the molecular test but i i don't have the exact numbers off the top of my head okay great thank you maybe we'll get those from you at a later date and then leslie was asking about the if you can use the nasopharyngeal swab for saliva so you don't so you would want to just collect a direct saliva and not the you don't want to dilute the saliva into the transport media so the saliva would need to be collected pooling it in the mouth some of the the way that we validate it does not have any requirement for um time since you drinking or eating anything but the saliva just could be pulled in the mouth not like like expectorating like not coughing but just pulling the saliva in the mouth and then into a tube that does not have any transport media or any other type of material in the in the collection device thank you thank you carissa one more testing a question then we'll go we'll we'll let you rest for a minute um from the mexican medicaid office was asking um that's saying that some new mexico practices are using as sophia 2 force antigen fia can you can you comment on that platform yes um so the uh credel sophia assay was i believe the first rapid antigen test that was fda cleared it's a waived test and that i can so we give some performance data so when we looked at uh when it was reviewed compared to a molecular test um the path data from the package insert um shows that it has a pretty good performance with a percent positive agreement of 96.7 compared to molecular tests but again this test should be performed in patients who are symptomatic and within the first i believe it's five or seven days of symptoms so this should not be used as a screening test in asymptomatic populations and the performance of the test was adequate compared to molecular methods thank you very much for those thorough answers um there's a question by dan saltman asking about is there any more insight into the different behaviors of the different kobe 19 strains different strains and different geographies right no all i know it's the the 6 14 mutation seems to um increase uh infectivity apparently there's some more a better attachment to the receptor to the h2 that's number one and there was this publication that i think we discussed in a couple of weeks ago about the delta 382 a deletion of a part of the open reading frame eight of the of the genome of the virus that actually in singapore was associated with a milder clinical picture i mean patients were infected they had pneumonia but they didn't needed oxygen compared with with those without that division so so those are the two things that i have seen like like publishing the main in the main journals but i know there's a lot of rna mutations that have accumulated in different in different parts of the world and different sort of um strains of the virus circulating but those are the two more more robust association between the clinical aspect and the and the actual uh genomic information that that's that's what i know so far thank you nestor lesler carissa did you have anything else to add to that no let's say no chris i let me unmute you no nothing to add okay thank you great um just one more question leslie i'm gonna go ahead and have you ask your other question about um convalescent antibody you don't mind when you're giving the convolution antibody is there any way to actually concentrate it then since higher concentration is better or does it have to come concentrated to begin with high concentration to begin with yeah i have i have read about the hyperimmune there are ways to concentrate we have used it for other infections like like hyperimmune varicella suster or uh that is used for pregnancy so there are ways to concentrate antibodies i i just haven't read a lot about covet and hyperimmune plasma but i have seen uh the headlines of the of the papers uh using hyperimmune plasma so there are ways to concentrate the antibodies i just don't know i know obviously the other alternative is to actually produce monoclonal antibodies from a convalescent plasma or from a convalescent patient they they actually take the cells that produce the neutralizing antibodies and they and they um in the lab you can actually mass produce this specific neutralizing antibodies which are which are sort of from a monoclonal line of cells so it's it's it's also possible so those two things are are possible just getting monoclonal or or stopping hyperimmune plasma both are our possibilities i just don't know the methodology in detail i really don't know that's cool i hope they can do that soon thank you nestor there's another question about um any thoughts about the monoclonal antibodies in trials one is based on monoclonal iga antibody the other is a mixture of neutralizing and non-neutralizing igg i know i haven't i haven't seen anything that the latest i saw was that they were deploying some of these antibodies in nursing homes because are considered areas of high risk so they they they were actually and especially because we don't know if really uh geriatric patients are going to be able to mount a very strong immune uh response to the to the vaccines when they become available so one of the one of the hypotheses that they are exploring if it is if we can protect elderly patients and patients in in rehab facilities and nursing home using monoclonals and maybe we can use the monoplana every three months or every six months and have them protect when they're outbreaking we you know those are study starting the story so we don't have any information on the results but i know they're looking into that as prophylaxis obviously thank you nestor there's uh um there's a question from k burke i don't know if kay if you can unmute yourself it's a it's kind of a patient related question but just to remind you not to use any patient um names or anything any identifying information about the patient yeah my question was um was an elderly woman with diabetes well controlled she's been on bipap in the icu for several days now and she's been positive about two weeks and the family is asking when and if should when and if should they recommend or ask about convalescent plasma and or rem to severe and what kind of answer they should expect thank you can you also just introduce yourself uh i'm a family doc in las cruces excellent thank you yeah i think regarding the evidence in general i'm not not about specific about this patient but in general obviously with the with the study from the mayo clinic uh the plasma should be used early i mean in early means at least in the first three days it's when when you when we saw uh most of the benefits so i think that's number one and and the same for rendezvous actually rendezvous i didn't mention this in the update but also the fda extended the the indication for rendezvous to all hospitalized patients so not just hospitalized patient using oxygen so in theory um you know if rendezvous is available it can be indicated for if you follow the fda recommendation to all hospitalized patients so as soon as you are admitted with kovi in theory you can use use rendezvous according to the fda i mean but if you look at the act one which is the only you know well uh controlled study that was done the nih uh trial that was published in the new england journal the first auto was dr beagle in that story not everybody benefited uh as much from friendship in fact those who had a very advanced disease in icu intubated in ecmo there was no difference it was it was mostly concentrated in those um in the in the middle those were receiving oxygen but were not critically ill and in those were they were able to show the authors were able to show the shorten of the of the duration of hospitalization and a trend towards decreased mortality uh so so but i think they're going to publish very soon i i was talking today to one of the uh investigators of act one they're gonna publish the definitive report very soon so we'll see more details but i think with the fda now everybody who's admitted it's a candidate unless there's a contraindication because of renal dysfunction or liver dysfunction uh our candidate for rendezvous if it's available uh and and and if you're going to use convalescent plasma based on what we know so far you have to use it right away i mean as soon as the patient is submitted start getting the the plasma and transfusion in less than three days into their hospitalizations thank you very much nestor one other clinical related question for those patients using pulse oximetry at home what are the guidelines being used when should they be be concerned or seek help yeah i'm going to pass on that question i mean i have discussed this with dr harkins our our uh critical care pulmonary but it's really it's a bit complicated i i don't know exactly what criteria they're using i don't work in the in the er so i i'd rather not speculate i know that that oxygenation or or saturation is lower here in albuquerque probably it's also lower in santa fe so every every place that there is in certain altitude we cannot use like the national uh you know less than 94 which is one of the criteria that they used to consider uh call it uh uh as a moderate to severe copy uh here probably with with uh with our altitude is probably lower and we can be more permissive but i don't want to speculate because i don't really know what they they're using in the ed uh to to admit or or transfer a patient into that into the hospital leslie do you go ahead yeah what i've seen on the physician groups that i'm on and this is again just speculation but they said four percentage um points dropped from baseline which i think is as good a guideline as any but um nobody has really come up with guidelines that i've seen for altitude so what people have been using is for four point drop from baseline thank you that's super helpful thank you leslie um there's a couple of um questions about well dan saltman you asked about sewage affluent last i think last week as well but i don't know if there the question is now is there comments or concerns about sewage effluent testing especially in congregate living situations i don't know if anybody has any other information about that or any thoughts i can share a little bit there's been some recent press i haven't seen the the publication but at least it was impressed that a potential outbreak at a university in arizona was prevented by testing waste water um and so i think that you know in congregate settings especially when doing broad surveillance testing is really not an available option um places like a university setting um there's probably a place for for that as a method of public health surveillance um and so we're at the phase in this pandemic that we need to maybe disaggregate these two um pathways right there's the pathway for routine diagnostic testing and testing of the symptomatic population and then maybe some infection control surveillance but then there is this broad community surveillance um so there have been documented benefits for doing wastewater testing but that's got got to be included in a a systematic approach of testing um you know the right places at the right time with the right levels of frequency um so i think those are things that are being explored but maybe not operationalized everywhere over thank you carissa dan saltman does that answer your question or do you have other specific questions you can update yourself in well yeah thank you i'm sorry i'm not i don't have my camera on uh yeah there was the incident in arizona i i have a broader you know there's sort of a broader question do you think that as a as a medical community that we're biased towards high sensitivity high specificity tests and that during a pandemic that lower sensitivity tests that are cheaper and faster and and you know can be used day after day after day sort of is is a strategy that we've had a a sort of intellectual bias against because of our training in in medicine about how we view tests and that that really is that really is a good approach when you're trying to get out everywhere and and i i'm certainly i'm not disagreeing with carissa in any way either that targeted testing you know in a dormitory or in a prison you can you can isolate that effluent stream and test it directly or or even you know i don't know that it's a it's a plum it becomes a plumbing issue actually it's it's a you know can you get into this one street this isolated stream and test it specifically so the the whole you know thing about testing is really it seems to have evolved since we started talking about this in march where we wanted to use good tests now we're happy to use tests that aren't quite as good because they're they're faster and they cover the territory more effectively it seems like thank you dan krista do you have any um any thoughts about that i'll go to the other members of the panel as well sure i can start i think i think i i actually very much agree and if we had a test that was maybe a bit lower sensitivity but we had a supply chain that could ensure that everybody in specific populations could be tested every day or every other day um with you know even a 90 sensitivity that might be acceptable i think the challenge right now is that test does not exist um and so as soon as soon as it's out there i i'll i'll be ready to say let's go for it but right now the test does not exist to be able to do that and so in the meantime we have to figure out how do we test the highest risk risk populations with the best test available using the limited resources that we have right and i i also agree i mean totally i mean if we i mean if we have availability of of tests even if they're less sensitive uh but you're going to use it as you know frequently it's probably useful and there have been several papers uh especially modeling papers in which they they include less sensitive tests or do done frequently they're useful to to identify cases and isolate cases one challenge that we have is with a specificity and all i'll tell you this is something from a paper in jama in which they actually model um how frequent we needed to do testing for college uh when they were we were considering opening college they the scientists actually uh did a very nice analysis on on frequency of testing and one issue that they identified is it was the the specificity if you use a test that have a compromise specificity uh that has a lot of false false positive uh and you you plan to put those false positive or positive people in like isolation um that may be a challenge if you're like in a in a in a setting like the college because there's not enough isolation rooms or hotel rooms to put all these false positive one waiting for a definitive test so you know obviously sensitivity sacrificing sensitivity if you do it frequently can be overcome but also you have to face the reality that if you use a test that is not very specific you're going to have false positives that produce a lot of stress people are going to be isolated based on on those uh false positive and you have to then do another test that actually uh clarifies the the situation so it's a challenge it's a challenge when you use uh those the other the other interesting thing for regarding the the analysis of the sewage water if and if you have zero cases if we go to a point that a facility have zero cases or a city have zero cases um then that's very useful but if you you still have activity uh it's very hard to interpret a positive test because it could be anybody in the in the line of the sewage uh that it's marking so so uh so so that's that's interesting at the beginning of the epidemic i remember a couple of papers that they did in cities and they actually they went back and look at the sewage water before the health system identified the cases and they were able to find positive pcr in the sewage water you know several weeks and sometimes month before the epidemic was identified so it does have some public health utility but we have to recognize that there are also limitations uh with those uh type of tests thank you very much nestor um one other there's another just one more question about fecal matter uh the question question is if viral shedding is in fecal matter should we be advising all to cover the toilet seat while flushing i don't know if there's any guidance on that but i guess you can give your personal i haven't seen i haven't seen that guidance but i i saw a paper i don't remember i'm sorry for the for the for the our our uh right ken who's looking for the paper but i remember a case in which they actually measure the the presence of the virus in air after flushing and in fact they found uh they found presence of of virus in in aerosols so flushing those generates especially if it's a good flush it can generate some some aerosols and if the patient is excreting the virus in the stools you can actually find uh viruses for for some time in the air around the the toilet so so i mean it's sort of a laughing matter but it's a real concern if you get to to go into a room where there's just a patient just flush the toilet you you may inhale virus in theory it could happen because they have been they have looked at that uh in rooms of patients with positive uh with positive calling this leslie when i was in australia all the public toilets had covers and i gotta say i think that's a much more civilized way to go because even before covet there's not nice things in stool it'd be really nice not to have it flying around the bathroom true and most most public toilets yeah as you mentioned aren't don't have don't have seats on them don't have to have um covers on them so um one other leslie this one might be for you um let's see uh yeah harry seibold was asking about this what what sources have people been using to obtain pulse oximetry to send home with patients are you using or encouraging the many pulse oximeters that are available on the internet um i saw that question was hoping somebody else had an answer i remember somebody saying they've been managing to get them i have uh i don't know where to get them i gotta say so yeah if anybody knows please put it into the chat that would be helpful because i don't think nestor knows because you're not is not in that setting where he's finding those for people as an outpatient but i can tell you my personal story if i might i bought a i bought a postal symmeter i think my wife bought it on amazon or one of the onlines and i wanted to to calibrate it so i brought it here to unm to one of the units and when i went to the unit it was the same they have about the same the same portable uh thing in the hospital the one that i got over the uh amazon so so and obviously i couldn't calibrate it with that with the same uh apparatus or thing that they were using was the same as the one i have at home thank you nestor all right so there's an interesting question from melissa limon in doing case investigations cases have mentioned that they have been traveling to juarez or chihuahua to get treatment for cobin 19. the medications i have heard are ivermectin and prednisone also tamavir rivaroxaban have you heard anything about this oh yes we we're actually running covets in latin america and our participants have already commented uh what they're using in in latin america and unfortunately they're using it without much data it's not that they have like their own information and i can tell you in my country and i'm really uh you know somewhat ashamed by that even the minister of health has recommended hydrostatic hurricane and they have not removed the recommendation and and they're buying and they're giving away hydrochloroquine to all positive patients and they give them also you know combination of all the drugs in honduras they had this called mice uh combination in which they used um hypermectin and and and other uh uh medications to those who are diagnosed and they do it in a systematic way the government gives them like i have i call it the happy meal which which it has some vitamins the adremecting the hydrocrop coral queen in a small you know box almost looks like a happy meal and they give it to the person when they give them the results of the positive coffee so yeah there's a lot of that and the other thing that it's it's it's it's happening in you know south of the border is the the the oxy the plural we call in spanish is uh uh chlorine oxide or one of the one of these uh actually antiseptics that are used for for swimming pools people are are drinking this and there have been reports of death in peru in argentina and bolivia they even arrested representative of a church in in colombia because they were giving away this this um the oxy of the chloro how they call it uh as a miracle cure for kobe so there's a lot of a lot of uh you know that situation unfortunately in in other countries in latin america using basically the the desperation that people have to with the disease so it's really uh you know it's a pity but it's it's a reality that they're using a lot of unproven um uh because and in parties because we they cannot get rendezvous they they it's very hard to get the convalescent plasma in some rural areas so they're using whatever they imagine can work basically based on desperation and not on on evidence unfortunately thank you nestor i just wanted to let everybody know that the the link for the cme is in the is in the chat now so please fill that out if you want to see me and also we would just love to hear from you to give us feedback and let us know what what other things you'd like for us to cover in this in this tele echo session there's an interesting question i know probably don't have an answer but um andrew ondo in las cruces was asking is there any information on transmission and flights and people are flying at what their risk of transmission of covet is this is leslie there's actually been several studies that came out this last week i almost covered them but most of them have showed actually quite low rate of transmission which surprises me it seems like just a setup for everybody to get covered but um the rate of transmission has been um really much lower than anticipated in airline plates so great thank you investors you have anything else any other comments no totally agree i mean i think it's important to re and this this issue reminds me of of this aspect with the super spreaders i mean a lot of a lot of people that have this infection transmitted to very few others i mean like to one or two you can see the secondary attack rate uh at home in in the study done here the in the united states was 29 so only 20 so one out of three of your the people who live with you actually get infected if you have coffee if you think about it you spend with them several days day and night um you're there breathing the same air and only one in three become infected it's a relatively uh low secondary attack rate if you if you think of missiles or or uh chickenpox it's 90 the secondary attack rate so it's a big jump between those diseases and kobe um but there's on the other side of the story are the super spreader persons who have a very high wire load and actually can infect 17 20 25 other people when they go to church and they have been documented in church in choirs in different uh congregate settings in which only one person can infect multiple so it's it's an unequal um not everybody transmits the virus with the same efficiency and they're people who are very efficient because they they have this uh high viral load we presume and others who basically are infected and they they just you know uh are infectious for those around them but not it's not very very contagious and as we saw with what leslie show about the physicians or healthcare workers that didn't transmit to their to their patients and and they were probably very close and talking and only only very few uh events thank you very much as i mentioned there are a bunch of questions and the there were pre-registration questions about um sort of how to open schools safely and things like that but i'm not i don't think that i can nestor i'm leslie er and i know chris has to get off and i'll ask you those questions um there's a a question um from pamela daffern about use the use of steroids i don't know nestor if you can just give an update on where we're at with with the use of steroids right we have uh the main study that was out of the uk is the so-called recovery story in which they they actually enrolled thousands of patients in different arms they actually tested in every arm every intervention including hydroxychloroquine lopina retonable convalescent and dexamethasone and that story they presented the results of dexamethasone against uh placebo which was basically usual care what they call you you sold carry was not really a placebo and they found um for the first time because this was the first a large story that showed decreased mortality after that story they have been and before that sorry there were some retrospective reviews that showed that the steroids seems to improve uh mortality reduce hospitalization and since that story there's a being also study with prednisone um that also showing benefit immortality i saw a story i haven't read it completely but it talked about 75 percent less mortality in those that were treated with prednisone versus those who did not so there is there is especially late in the disease and those who are severe uh have a lot of inflammation steroids seems to be helpful um you know improving the clinical situation and also decreasing mortality so that that's what we know and it's actually incorporated in most of the guidelines patients who who are hospitalized and have evidence of of inflammation they are treated with dexamethasone or methylpernicilon or some of the other steroids that are available in the different in the different settings thank you so much chester um deborah i'm going to ask deborah bear a question and deborah i i have to put you on the spot and you don't have to answer but you're in a new mexico department of health epidemiologists that put your stuff into the chat so there's a question that came on the pre-registration about why does the new mexico department of health define a close contact differently than the cdc i don't know if you can comment on that deborah if you can unmute yourself i'm i'm actually i at the um covet follow-up clinic at unm i'm a family mp i'm not uh epidemiologist sorry oh sorry about that somebody i thought was oh maybe there's something else go ahead melissa can you answer that question okay so in new mexico we're trying to be more conservative than what cdc has been doing this whole time so instead of 15 minutes we we decided to leave it at six minutes because before it was three or more minutes and when cdc changed it to 15 minutes we decided to leave it at six minutes just to be more conservative thank you very much for that for that answer um let's see there was one other question miranda durham was asking about and i know chris is off but i think nestor you can probably answer this about um would reporting the cycle threshold help with knowing how infectious people are is this practical yeah i don't know the operational details of the cycle threshold but i i know that you know the the the higher the wire load the earlier the test that uh positive with so so the machine needs to do less cycles of of uh of pcr to be positive so it's used as a surrogate marker for buyer load the ideal situation is to actually have like a standards buyer loads and running in your machine so you have sort of standard values and then when you run your test you can actually infer from those standard values you can more appropriately infer the viral load but yeah the city is used the recycled pressure is used as an indirect or a surrogate marker for buyer load the smaller the city the higher the buyer load the higher the ct the more time you have to wait for the test to be positive the the less buyer load is present in the in the sample that's that's sort of the the the hypothesis thank you mister so i think well i'm telling you i suggested a long time ago that they give us a microscope and they refuse to do it no yeah i know i mean how about something huh okay um so we uh have just a couple minutes left so i think we're gonna have to wrap up thank you so much for joining everyone i just have a couple of announcements for the end here um we will have our critical care session this week is now let's move to the first and the third thursdays but at eight o'clock um on september 3rd there will be a critical care session uh and also just as a reminder next week on on september 7th is labor day and will there will be no office hours next week we'll resume again um the following week and again the cme link is in the chat and if you have other questions please send us a an email at covid19 um the email here at echo and we will hopefully we'll be able to answer those so thank you everyone for joining and we will see you in not next week but the week after thank you you,,8/31/2020
19,group c and d uh the ones that had the adjuvant the 50 micrograms of the agilent which is a plant-based adjuvant and and received two doses were the two most uh immunogenic vaccines and we can see here we have the placebo a b and you can see the five microgram and the 25 micrograms a double dose those one and two using the matrix which is the matrix mi is the adjuvant they have the higher and this is the the anti-spike igg the highest level of antibody and they actually use uh convalescent uh plasma levels to compare these are patients who actually recover from kobe uh some have asymptomatic disease some were hospitalized like the one in in purple and other had like just outpatient kobe and you can see that the the level of antibodies with the vaccines which are actually comparable or maybe slightly higher but definitely similar to convalescent plasma on those five micrograms and and 25 microgram double dose of the vaccine so probably they're gonna move forward with the five microgram because as you can see produce the same immunological response these are the the neutralizing antibodies which is the other measure that we have shown in previous studies again uh decent levels neutralizing antibodies comparable to the convalescent plasma in the double dose adjuvant vaccine so so good results from the humeral immunity and there was a correlation between the antique spike because this is basically a spike protein injected um between the anti-spikes igg and the neutralizing antibodies are linear correlation very clear um on the on the generation of neutralizing antibodies associated with antibodies to this by protein looking at the at the t cell response um from the from the best two candidates the five microgram and 25 both generated th1 type of of cytokines and and cellular response and almost none uh th2 which is which is considered not not appropriate uh you you when you use this type of vaccine for respiratory viruses you prefer th1 because th2 have been associated with some uh evidence of of long inflammation especially with the rsv vaccine so so so this protein with adjuvant uh produce good humeral response and good cellular response and that was basically the conclusion of these uh small story phase one two and they're obviously going to move forward with this protein vaccine to the phase three studies the other the other uh clinical trial that was published was the the the gamalia institute vaccine or the russian vaccine as a as it is known on the on the media this is actually an adenovirus human adenovirus recombinant adenovirus vaccine and uses two different adenovirus adenovirus 26 and adenovirus 5 and within that adenovirus which is which is actually a virus that can cause you know a reaction in the body but it's not replicative the inside of these these virus they put a small piece of uh genetic material that actually uh produces the the spike protein so the idea is to use this as a a vector to get into the cells and then to produce the protein and then the immune system will recognize the spike protein from from from the from the coronavirus and and thus give give you protection they actually i'll show you the design of the story they actually did two studies one with the frozen vaccine they call it a gamma layer copied back which is basically frozen and another one leo files preparation 38 volunteers in each arm so a relatively small phase one slash two study and they they uh actually administer different preparation there's no placebo here to one group of nine subjects they gave just the adenovirus 26 um another group just got the adenovirus 5 and then 20 received uh sort of a sequential the adenovirus 26 on day 0 and then adenovirus 5 on day 21 so it was sort of a prime booster with two different adenovirus and the idea is that in case the subject has immunity to adenovirus 26 natural immunity from previous infection um you're giving a different you're given the the protein the s-protein with a different adenovirus a second time around with with the hope of producing a better response and very similar uh for the la the lyophilized vaccine 26 5 by itself or the combination which is what they actually plan to do on the large um and then they follow this patient and evaluate the immune response safety and and immunogenicity and by the way i didn't mention the safety of the nova x vaccine but they they obviously did not um detected any serious adverse event in those small small studies just local and and systemic reaction but were not really uh considered uh serious and this is the results of the of the russian story regarding antibodies against the spike protein or the rbd which is the receptor binding domain the the specific part of the spike protein that is presumed to be associated with neutralizing antibodies and you can see that for the combination on day 28 and 42 there were significantly high levels of antibodies both in the frozen and the leo lyo formulation and again they should they use also a very similar uh idea they compare with convalescent plasma from russian patients that have recovered from kobe 19. so these are the levels of antibodies which you can see that are similar to the levels achieved in day 28 and 42 with his vaccine so apparently apparently good immune response the same with neutralizing antibodies you can see the levels at day 42 uh pretty decent levels very similar to what you get with the natural infection according to these uh russian scientists and when you look at t-cell t-cell immunity they actually measure the proportion of cd4 and cda cells that were stimulated or or growth and they and they found basically also a good cellular immune response with these adenovirus recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine um and and and also interferon gamma release also which is a sign of th1 again with the with the the two formulations of vaccine they didn't find any any significant difference between the two preparation the frozen and the and the other the the the lyophilia feliz um vaccine so their conclusion was that these heterologous adenovirus vaccine with 26 and 5 induce had a good safety profile and induce strong humeral and cellular immune responses after the the study was published i saw in the social media some criticism to some of the graphs and values they said that some of the values were repetitive so they're questioning their result but obviously we have to wait for the for the authors to to respond to those criticism in the in the journal but at least um they publish the phase one two study another another uh another uh different issue is the the use of of corticosteroids you remember we we actually talked about this with the recovery trial the recovery trial was the uk large trial that demonstrated that steroids especially in patients requiring oxygen or in mechanical ventilation had a mortality benefit or decreasing the mortality from using dexamethasone so the the investigator from the w a show uh group called the whole rapid evidence appraisal for copy therapy actually did a meta-analysis of of the seven randomized clinical trials that have been published using steroids they actually put together all that all those seven trials a total of um 1700 approximately 1700 critically ill patients with choline 19 and and their their conclusion was that they actually found uh in this meta-analysis was that in those in those 1700 patients there was an odds ratio of 0.66 of mortality so a 33 percent less mortality when they were treated with corticosteroids and in this case they use not only dexamethasone but they included they included uh materials alone um and hydrocortisone in there in their uh in their different trials so so it's sort of a um another piece of evidence that that actually is it's uh it's um additional to the recovery trial that was published before giving um usefulness for for steroids to decrease mortality per body in especially in patients with severe coping or advanced scoby not at the beginning of the disease that's important to to clarify and then we move just to finish a couple of interesting transmission papers or papers on transmission both from china and the first one it's an outbreak it's really really uh interesting this is an outbreak that occur uh in china during the lockdown uh and it occurred in a 30-story floor residential building in one sioux city uh in that building there were 202 residents 57 families some of the flats or or apartments were unoccupied in that relatively large building and actually they documented three families in that building affected the index family or the the first one has traveled to wuhan and then they found uh cases on the 25th and 27th floor and the interesting thing is that all the this is the the sort of the blueprint of the building and there were like three areas the area zero one zero three and zero four and all of the cases in the 15th 25th and 27th floor occur on these on this area so the authors actually postulated that that those infected in in the 15th floor somehow transmitted the disease through the through the through the pipes to actually to the black water pipes in the building and they actually have a drawing in the and their hypothesis and and you know it's it's sort of um exploratory hypothesis that that because the virus is just creating in fecal matter uh probably when the the families living on the 15th floor that were infected actually uh send the virus into the into the pipes essentially and then fecal aerosols probably travel up the black water pipe and got into the bathtub or floor drain in those uh bathroom in the 25th and 27th floor because there was no other epidemiological exposure for these families except for being in their house during the the the pandemic and no no contact with the with the with the family on 1502 so that's and they did also they they actually tested also a gas they put like a like a marker gas into the into the system and they were able to document the presence of the gas in other floors uh especially if the if the the new trap that it was dry there was no water here you can get the the vapor of the gas to come out out of the drain so interesting and these have been seen before with the sars kobe one some some of you may remember the outbreak in the amoy gardens building in i think in hong kong with the sars kobe one there were several people in that building affected with such kobe one so that was i thought it was interesting the other uh outbreak it's a demonstration of another outbreak in a closed environment this this was an activity um that also happened in china in which there were a group of of of uh lay buddhist buddhists who were going to a religious event one a group winning a boss 60 and another one 68 another boss and there was one person infected in boss number two and actually 24 out of the 68 turned out to be positive later on so that it was a 35.3 attack rate just by sharing the bus for a hundred minutes uh it was an air-conditioning boss so it had a close ventilation system and this is the sort of the the the pink and yellow are people who became infected white are those who did not become infected this is actually the the drawing of the boss and you can see that all over the bus there were positive positive uh persons with with uh with kobe then the index patient was the one in red here identified by ip uh this this group also shares some time in the in the uh actually temple that they visited but the attack rate in the temple was much less it was only 4.1 percent of the 172 people who attended that religious activity only seven that were not in the boss got infected as opposed to 24 out of 68 illustrating the you know the potential for for transmission in a in a close environment like this with with air condition for 100 minutes um so that was basically the conclusion all right thank you i want to start sharing and we'll go through the questions thank you so much nestor um marla seaver's some has has a brief update and then leslie sieber leslie hayes has a brief update and then we'll go through the questions of okay nestor marla thanks joanna i just had a brief announcement um department of health is engaged across many divisions in planning for a sars kobe vaccine rollout which we are told may be expected as soon as sometime in early november and so all state health departments are currently engaged in planning for receipt of this vaccine and rollout cdc has set some priority groups for vaccine one being frontline healthcare workers and the other being residents and employees in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities and as part of our vaccine planning we will be sending out a survey through the statewide immunization registry at the end of this week asking all health care providers primarily acute care hospitals community health centers fqhcs to respond and provide us some information about front-line healthcare workers in your facility particularly those that are engaged in high risk activities like icu care or respiratory therapy and also some questions about your ability to store vaccine and how many vaccine providers you might have at your location so what we're currently planning for is a roll out to priority populations as early as late fall and through the winter and then uh scaled up roll out which may reach population levels as early as this spring and so we're trying to plan for um how vaccine will be deployed around the state using partners like pharmacies hospitals and fqhcs to help us do that so if you receive that survey please respond we're using it for our planning for vaccine rollout and once that goes out i'll bring the link to this meeting next week in case you're unsure if your facility has received that and i'll bring it so that you all can follow up if you'd like for your facility to make sure that someone received that survey and responded thank you thank you thank you marla which vet do you know which vaccine is being entertained for the state all we've been told now is that you know among the six sort of primary vaccine candidates you know there's three that we hear a lot about and um they are anticipating that at least one we've not been told which one yet um available for early distribution sometime in november and like i said cdc is going to set some priorities with hhs about who that vaccine will be available to first and then the anticipation is that they that will continue to scale up um through the winter and that by spring 2021 we may have enough vaccine available to make it um you know widely distributed through the population so more to come there's a lot of we we have more um unanswered questions than answered at this point um but logistically um we're starting to get ready for that rollout thank you marla and please uh chat in your questions um i want to turn it over to leslie hayes who has a brief update as well i was mostly going to focus on mental health and covid today um first is just depression and they had a telephone survey of 1441 adults that they compared with nhanes data from prior to covered 19 and not surprising they found that depression was much much higher it's about three times higher um it's especially high if you have lower income less than five thousand dollars in savings and um quite high if you had exposure to more stressors um they also found that people who were married um have less risk of depression than people who are divorced or separated or people who have never been married so i think it's really important we'd be screening patients for this and offering referral to treatment and i think it's also in my experience been helpful just to kind of normalize that i have patients calling in and saying i just i don't know why i'm not coping and talking to them about the fact that this is actually very very common and multiple people are suffering from depression at this point i find has been reassuring to them um there was also a new york times article about this where they were talking about the long haulards actually anxiety and depression has been a very common symptom for them anxiety was actually the eighth most common symptom they listed and then difficulty concentrating and depression were also common and part of the reason they gave was that people didn't take them seriously thought they were just kind of milking it or you know didn't really have this or being unreasonable about it and so normalizing it and saying yes that this can happen afterwards um really um seemed to help and then some people actually stated that participation in online support groups improved their mental health symptoms and then um we've mentioned this before wall street journal had a pretty good article on this last week about the opioid crisis and just rising drug fatalities across the country they surveyed u.s adults in june and 13 they had either started or increased their substance use to deal with stress or emotions related to covid19 um social distancing is making it a lot harder for people to access meetings and counseling and then the pandemic also interrupted the supply chain so as a result people often needed to go to new dealers and potential for more potent drugs or potential to be contaminated with fentanyl any number of issues and then people are still this is still an issue of people delaying or avoiding medical care in june there was an estimate that 41 percent of you adult us adults had either delayed or avoided medical care including emergency or urgent care and routine care as well and i think it's really important we do let people know it is safe to come into our clinics the studies have really shown that people are not getting cobit from health care settings at this point i think the medical system despite not getting great support on ppe i think we've done a wonderful job of doing everything we can to make sure it's safe in our facilities and i think it's important to let people know that and especially if you look the people who are not getting urgent or emergency care was really prevalent among people who are also at high risk for covid so unpaid caregivers for adults persons with underlying medical conditions black adults hispanic adults young adults are the only group not at high risk but persons with disabilities and then this last one i thought was cool so um when i was eight i actually read an article about how they developed the smallpox vaccine and i thought that was so cool that i decided i wanted to be a doctor and um almost 50 years later here i am and so um so this was a an editorial in the new england journal and it was about um variolation so the difference between variolation and vaccination is that variolation actually uses the actual virus and it induces a mild infection and you get immunity from this and there was a really wonderful book a few years ago called the speckled monster that talked a lot about um a noble lady in england and a doctor in colonial america who introduced variolation into their communities and variola is the scientific name for the smallpox virus and so you're using just a small amount of smallpox virus they would inject just a small amount and induce immunity that way um so that people didn't get bad infection vaccination is where you're using something that's not actual virus to induce immunity and that's the original vaccine was vaccinia or cow pox so and what they found was universal masking seems to reduce the rate of new infections and possibly increases the proportion of infections that are symptomatic and they think it's due to the variolation that when you get exposed to it you get exposed to a much smaller amount because the masks are filtering it out so and they had a few um examples of this there was an outbreak on a closed argentinian cruise ship where the passengers were provided with surgical masks and the staff had an n95 rate of asymmetric infection on that ship was 81 and there was an earlier cruise ship where they did not have masking and that was only 20 percent there were also two recent outbreaks in u.s food processing plants and all the workers were issued masks and there were asymptomatic infections um uh among the 95 percent of the infections were asymptomatic among more than 500 people and only 5 actually had symptoms and then in countries that had mandatory enforced population wide masking the case fatality rates are lower even when you have resurgence of cases so i just thought that was kind of a cool thing and a good reason to wear masks so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie thanks for all the great updates i'm going to turn it over to carla who's going to start without all the great questions yeah thank you joanna um yeah there's a lot of questions so we're going to go we're gonna try to combine some of them i think um so nestor just the two the two studies that you presented at the at the end the one about particularly about the apartment building there are a couple of questions like i'm gonna just gonna go over a few of them and you can you can talk about that um they were asking about how did how did they know basically that it wasn't in the air and then transmitted through the air and also one of the questions was didn't people use the same elevators like how did they how did they decide that that was the way that that was transmitted yeah well first first of all there were no other cases in any other areas of the of the building so that was one it was only on that tower on that part of the tower second they didn't i mean they interview uh all of the affected families and you know according to what they reported they didn't coincide in any social areas or elevators as far as they could remember so so um so they they basically did it because they rule out other ways of contact and as i said um there were no other infections in any other areas and on the same floor or people who actually share the elevators more so that's why how they concluded obviously this is a working hypothesis but they concluded that the most likely source was these uh what they call the the the fecal bio aerosols through the through the pipes and as i said in the in the presentation they actually tested the hypothesis by putting uh gas in the in the in the system and they actually detected gas that special detectable gas in other floors above when they when they put it on the on the pipes and they also culture some of the apartments that were empty and they found virus in the apartments that were empty so that was another piece of evidence that not only they showed that the you know the testing gas could move up but also they didn't demonstrate the presence of virus in one of the floors above the 15th floor uh there was an apartment that there had not been no humans there uh because of the it was empty so so that was another piece of evidence that probably it actually traveled somehow and and what they said is that these families the difference between this family and other families is that they didn't use the bathtub so the hypothesis was that the manhole the thing that is like a u was was not with the water seal it was actually dry so the so the gas or the the bio aerosols can actually travel backward and go through the through the to the drain as opposed to people who are using their their their showers or their their bathtubs and they were filled with water in the in the u part so all of those were like sort of circumstantial evidence but the conclusion was the most likely was through these this type of of of of uh you know of pipes in the building as opposed to some other some other way great thank you fascinating um the other about the in in terms of the bus outbreak a couple of questions asked about masks were people wearing masks no they were not they were not they were not wearing masks it was really early in the in the epidemic and and what the author says that in that city there hasn't been any any cases of kobe 19 at that moment so people were not really wearing masks and as i said they they shared the boss and they also were together in the in the in the temple and they had i think either lunch or dinner during the activity but the interesting thing is was the the really the contagion occur mainly in the bus there were a few cases among uh other participants that didn't share the boss but it was definitely the bus the the area where most of the most of the positive and and the the other interesting thing is that those who were in the bus did not sit together to have lunch they actually were mixed with other groups so it was definitely the contact during the boss trip more than the contact in the in the temple although there were as i said there were i think nine or seven uh who got infected outside the boss presumably and all of those who got infected outside the bus had direct contact with the with the index case in the bus during the during the ceremony et cetera great thank you and lynn coleman asked maybe lin you must have read this study but she said um writers sitting by open windows did not get infected however is that correct that i don't know i know they they have the drawings of the of the windows in the bus but i i i don't remember that detail to be honest i don't know lynn are you if you can unmute yourself and did you so much that all those presentations were so fantastic thank you all yeah i thought that study was really fascinating that even the symptomatic patient wasn't coughing he had no symptoms until later his whole family was then infected but nobody in the other bus and each bus had what almost 70 people um so i don't you know it's concerning but i'm trying to think of what we can learn from that because especially with all the fires now we have to be more inside so your advice is appreciated yeah thank you lynn nestor did you have something i i mean one is try to avoid any crowded areas i mean buses restaurants places are closed and if you cannot obviously wear a mask and the other thing is to try to improve the ventilation and it was the same with the example of the restaurant in china um you know if you have a closed uh area if there's any way you can open a couple of windows uh you know to have air circulation air exchange obviously there are ways to to uh to to produce air exchange with special you know air conditioning system and machines and and hepa filter but if you can at least have a ventilator area if you if you that's what i'm telling my colleagues in latin america to try to to instruct people who own restaurants or small businesses to have their doors open especially in tropical climates but you can have the door opens and windows open so there's at least some air circulation within those close places and obviously where where the mask for the varialization too thank you nestor and marla there's a couple of questions you may have seen them in the chat just about for the vaccine or homeless populations in congregate settings going to be um prioritized as well and also a question about domestic violence shelters yeah those other sorts of congregate living settings um might be prioritized in more of the tier two um you know cdc and hhs will really be setting the priorities for tier one um and then as more vaccine becomes available states will have more um ability to influence um and identify priority populations on their own so those are all um settings that we're already talking about people who live in you know any sort of congregate living situation um people who are incarcerated um people who are in different types of shelters um you know also for new mexico we have to think about our american indian and alaska native population as they've been disproportionately impacted and should that be a priority population for vaccines so it's part of what the working group is talking about but initially we won't be setting the priorities at the state level they'll be coming from the federal level but sort of as vaccine availability ramps up and kind of that phase two we'll be able to identify some of our own priorities and those are all areas that we're talking about thank you very much um i wanted just to go to a question for um cecilia cecilia can you enter um thank you cecilia can you end yourself and introduce yourself from tricor yeah my name is cecilia thompson i recently moved here to new mexico and um i will be working with dr carissa culbreth as medical director of infectious disease here great thank you we're really happy to have you um there's a question from our colleague in espanola kim joy asking if we could get an update on the rapid tests for covid how available they are how good they are just any any new knowledge that you have about that sure um there's not a lot to update they are not widely available at this time and it's kind of questionable when they will become widely available as far as the accuracy if you look at the eua and the product information they do tend to make very high claims that they have they're very good but as they move into the general public and and laboratories are able to test them with real patient samples we've seen kind of a wide range of of how well they perform so especially now for the binax that was made some headlines a few weeks ago that is not widely available and it has not been tested in clinical laboratories to verify the claims made of how accurate it is great thank you this comes up almost every monday so i'll be happy to hear an update every every monday about that sure i wanted to go to deborah van willigan from el prado new mexico i don't know if debra if you can meet yourself but just had questions about this i know leslie talked a little bit about long haulers but just whether or not there were uh studies that they could enroll in to sort of look at the impact of postcovid deborah are you yes i am can you hear me yeah okay great so i'm a family medicine doc in towson new mexico and i have two patients one has brain fog and the other one has extreme fatigue and they were ill in march um one of them tried to get tested and wasn't able to because she hadn't traveled but it it all you know they were they had suspicious symptoms and so the question is are there any studies that i can refer them to or any further information on long haulers as it becomes more more known thank you deborah nestor did you have any yeah no i don't have any knowledge of any study here at unm uh i will have to to talk uh uh to dr paratha i think deborah is here also from from the group of the 1209 clinic i mean we are interested we have been following i've been exchanging uh some of the publication with with the group of of the ambulatory internal medicine uh but it's it's something relatively new and i'm not aware of any open enrolling stories i can tell you there have been important publication i was going to share it in the next week and the next monday but i can give you sort of an advance there's a publication in the landsat if i remember correctly about the the brain or neurologic manifestations of of long copy they use uh some sophisticated imaging techniques and also surveys and there's definitely if i remember correctly like around 55 of the patients in that study had some neurological symptoms and and a lot of findings in the imaging they're also been uh cardiac manifestation in athletes there was a publication on 26 uh college uh uh athletes who had some evidence of of cardiac disease so so we are getting more and more information um on on the on the manifestation not only on the subjective you know reported symptoms which are many many there's actually a large survey um like a crowdsourcing survey from university of indiana in which people using an app are are telling their symptoms but there's also a lot of publications on on more uh details on the on the pathophysiological findings on these subjects but not that i i don't think we are doing uh slowly now i know jail university will start um a slowly more than anything looking at the immunological uh alterations we don't know if it's if it's low grade virus replication if it's uh those pieces of rna that we are detecting in the in the in the nasopharyngeal testing if they are stimulating the immune system or it's just a hyperactive immune system and not not really any virus around we don't know what the explanation for this uh uh unusual persistent persistent symptoms are thank you great thank you so much for the all the great questions i'm the joanna katzman here i'm going to take over some of the questioning now um question from mary zeitner says do we have any information about people avoiding medical care secondary to financial reasons i need to see if you've seen that nestor or perhaps leslie hayes has leslie hayes family medicine oh sorry go ahead i have definitely seen patients avoiding medical care because of financial stress and um it's been very hard to get people in for um some testing um especially because of it i have not seen any studies but i gotta believe that's the case nestor what is your thinking about that no i haven't i mean i'm a sober specialist so i don't do primary care but i can tell you from what i have read i remember i think we presented this story on cancer how the cancer incidents went down for several kind is people are not going i'm not searching for the usual you know i don't know if it's for financial reason or for fear of the virus but the results is the same people are delaying the diagnosis and their attendance to to uh to their clinics because of these epidemics so uh it's something really you know worrisome because they're going to present later in the course of their diseases many or with already established a consequence or sequelae thank you both joanna here again um i wanted to ask you a question this is actually from leslie leslie hayes she says i've seen suggestions using um inhaled steroids and out outpatient and is there any evidence for this do you know about that nestor no i haven't reviewed the literature on that specifically i i remember seeing uh some planned stories in clinicaltrial.gov but i haven't seen any published you know large trial of inhaled uh steroids great great um thank you um another question uh is um related to debra von willigan who was just on the phone asked this question about mass and might carbon or other filter mass be helpful um if if uses inserts and have you um seen anything about that nestor no i mean the stories that we have reviewed before there is obviously a difference between the different masks i mean the best to filter everything obviously are the n95 then probably probably next to that is a surgical mask that you know the the professional grade surgical math then the the procedure mask and then you have the whole plethora of other you know cotton with with polyester mask regular mask all the way down to the lowest which is bandanas i remember in one of the studies had the lead the least filtering capacity so there's sort of a you know a very diverse um variety of masks with diverse abilities to filter and there was a paper on these that actually tried to evaluate the the retention of particles with different materials i remember that obviously n95 and surgical mask got the number one into a place in quality thank you nestor um i'm wondering if a dan might be able to come on if he might be able to unmute and ask his questions about the the apps related to contact tracing perhaps marla might have any uh be able to answer that thanks dan hi uh hi thank you all for you for your efforts in this uh i was just um yeah the test test trace and isolate is a is the public health response for cu that involves contact tracing and and apple and and google released these uh bluetooth enabled apps that that that are that supposedly have anonymity built into them in a real integral way and i was wondering if they've been studied at all and if there's um you know and the protocols for test trace and isolate has been a big challenge for public health departments i think and i was wondering if there's been any quality improvement uh efforts in that or like if there's a if there's protocols for that that are becoming best practices and uh lastly about that you know is is it still is it still a viable strategy that just too many you know is the horse out of the barn are there just too many infections to be able to effectively test trace and isolate you know track down the contact is that realistic anymore so um yeah great marla um might you be able to speak to dan's question sure so i think there was a good um article in nature talking about uh the google and apple contact tracing apps and there wasn't any sort of outcome or efficacy data but they did talk about implementation challenges um uptake for this kind of tracing in the united states has not been good people you know have not been motivated or interested in participating in these kind of um location sharing and data sharing um apps for contact tracing so the uptake in the united states has been really challenging so they've not really been rolled out um in a wide you know wide usage the way i think um you know we thought there was promise maybe for them they've there's not been much uptake in the us but there's a good article um in nature about that um that you can read it's really interesting um and i think in terms of contact tracing you know now in new mexico where our case counts are much lower we actually you know have an opportunity for contact tracing to be more effective again to your point when there's widespread um community transmission it's harder to pinpoint you know what the exposures or the contacts might have been but now that um you know our case counts are much lower our test positivity rate is much lower our r effective is below one we really do have the opportunity to identify those transmission events and small clusters and use contact tracing to try to isolate people and prevent further spread so we definitely went through a phase where contact tracing was probably less effective but because we've brought the case counts down significantly contact tracing can be more effective than it was when we were sort of you know at the height of community transmission thanks marlo we're really grateful to how well mexico and new mexico is doing and and it's primarily because of everything you're doing uh doug clark has a question uh uh uh for us and as you know doug works for the state and he says is there any evidence regarding coven risks and obtaining dental care um do you know about that nestor no i i just remember either hearing or or in a postcast or something that the risk is slow that there hasn't been many cases but i i honestly have not reviewed the literature in depth to to give an opinion if somebody else can i don't know for sure but i do know world health organization about a month ago recommended against routine dental care right now so great uh this is joanne i did wanna just mention that jane epstein put a very nice comment in the chat about the the lasting misery of coronavirus long haulers and she also put in the uh the website to the article in nature so thanks for that jane um i'm going to go to one more question and then have a carla follow up after me [Music] um and uh the dental care session settings okay if you wanna i can ask a question tomorrow yes please i i have been following the numbers of the department of health and i see that there were a couple of days that were 30s and 6 and and 40s and then all of a sudden jump to 160 i don't remember exactly the number is there uh some type of periodicity can you comment on that how i mean because for me as a you know as a infectious disease it doesn't make sense to go up and down unless there's a human factor like reports get on monday and wednesday and not every day is the same so can you comment on that right yeah so those case reports that come out each day that are in the press release and updated on our website our test results from that day so they don't correspond to the date the test was collected you do see that in our seven day rolling average and so trying to sort of smooth out those peaks and valleys but when there's a big you know community-wide testing event um you know or those kinds of ramped up test efforts that are happening around the state then we might get a bolus of results that all come in um on one day from a particular lab which you know sort of helps account for that up and down we also have um you know less timely reporting from some out of state reference labs and so sometimes again we'll get a bolus of test results from those laboratories that can span several weeks worth of testing and so they're not always you know the results coming in aren't always related in time to when the test was collected so that's why we use test collection date in that seven day rolling average and in the reproductive rate calculation to try to account for those differences and smooth out those daily ups and downs thank you marla back to you carla thank you very much i wanted to actually go back to um to cecilia thompson at tricor one of the questions that came in in the pre-registration was about the how quickly the testing people are getting their test results back and i know you don't know the answer for all of the but in terms of tri-core what is the turnaround time for for copa test at this point it kind of depends a little bit on who's being tested for patients that are having that are getting a test pre-procedure as a screening measure to determine how much ppe needs to be worn those have a general turnaround of three days but in experience there from my experience at least and i've only been at tricor a few weeks now there resulted um prior to their resulted before that 3 72 hour window um all the other testing um again in my kind of limited experience here at tricor has been um give or take about 24 hours great thank you so much marla i don't know if you have anything to add to that in terms of what what how fast you guys are getting turned around for when when you're doing um investigations if you can comment on that and also can you comment on whether um there's a recommendation for testing asymptomatic individuals who've been exposed yes so um despite the confusing information that cdc released about people who've been exposed not necessarily needing to be tested it still is our recommendation from the department of health that contacts of known cases and people with known exposures be tested regardless of symptoms so that recommendation from the department of health hasn't changed i know it's been more difficult for asymptomatic people to be tested through some of the hospital-led testing events they've kind of shifted their focus to more symptomatic testing or testing for you know pre-procedure and other reasons but asymptomatic testing for anyone is available at all of the public health offices throughout the state and marla what is the turnaround time for those tests yeah so turnaround time at the state lab is really good right now i've seen tests come back um you know in as few as about 12 hours depending you know what time of day the the specimen arrives at the lab if it makes it into the morning batch they can turn around pretty quickly but you know 24 to 36 hours for at the state lab seems to be about typical right now and that's from the time the specimen arrives at the lab so i know there's always a lot of variability um in testing that's done you know the lab is in albuquerque sometimes transit can be a day or more depending where the specimen is coming from so you have to factor that in but once it reaches the lab right now the state lab is able to turn around pretty quickly great thank you and that's interesting because i have a family member who is quite symptomatic awaiting covet test results and she's currently over 96 hours and hasn't gotten the results yet through um i believe president sending them to tri-course so um there are definitely delays some places yeah correct and i know um i don't want to speak for tri-core but i know that there you know continue to be um problems with uh laboratory supplies reagents and other lab supplies that have impacted turnaround time um you know at different laboratories thank you very much um i just wanted to remind everybody that the the cme link just went into the chat about 12 45 so if you're interested in getting see me please go ahead and fill that out and also even if you don't want to see me we would love to hear from you so if you if you would fill that up that would be great there's a very interesting question that was sent through the pre-registration from deborah mccreath from ohio asking why does anyone think that an effective vaccine can be created in nine months when it usually takes much longer than that to to actually test to create and test a vaccine so maybe nestor maybe you can approach that one yeah i'm gonna get into trouble with this answer but yeah i i mean there's things have moved really fast with the kobe 19 that's you know i never seen that i worked in vaccines for works in research um in my country for many years and yes they take forever we still don't have an effective vaccine for malaria or for hiv uh or for herpes there are many many diseases that are very prevalent and we don't have a commercially available vaccine they're still on the research and these diseases have been known for many years so it's true that the premise of the question is absolutely true but i think everything is different with kobe 19 i mean people are really putting a lot of uh money and effort in developing a vaccine and right now they're like between eight and nine vaccines that are starting human trials phase three human trials they've already gone through phase one and two and they're more than i i lost count but the last time i saw 132 that were on human already starting human testing in phase one two so there's a lot of a lot of work a lot of uh stories going on um regarding the phase three stories i i am a little bit um uh hesitant to believe that we're going to have an of an available vaccine by october or by the end of october most of the scientists that i follow like on on on on social media or podcasts etc um they have their questions because if you imagine if you're enrolling in a phase three study now and it's a two dose vaccine i mean if you put the first dose in september you're gonna put the the second dose probably in the middle of october and then you have to wait for some time to eat for events to occur to those who have received the placebo so unless the vaccinated person is in the middle of a of a very active uh community outbreak uh they may not have time to to catch kobe 19 enough to be to to to be enough numbers uh to make up a significant statistically significant difference between them the placebo group and the vaccine group so so it's hard to imagine and and and some of the critiques that have been voiced by the scientific community is that we don't know what's going to be considered a successful and effective or safe vaccine because the stopping rule has are not very clear uh so so there's a lot of questioning going back and forth we'll just have to wait i heard the i think it was the pfizer ceo saying that yeah they're going to have some information by the end of october so so who knows and and there's so many things in the in the in discussion right now or that it's it's it's somewhat controversial but we have to see but i'm i'm i'm kind of you know i don't i'm not sure we're going to have an answer by the end of october but maybe i'm wrong and we are depending on what criteria they use for efficacy and safety with all these vaccines that are moving at really really really fast speed okay thank you very much and then i think we have one more ques one one last question is there any updated information on the theory of possible reinfection or secondary infection for those who've had it um previously dr seibold was asking that question right no i haven't seen anything i saw the the you know the paper by the group in hong kong who actually published the story of that person and then the comments on the reno nevada patient but i haven't seen any anything anything else there was a a nice uh review paper on the path up for immunity it's called the path to immunity i think it's i don't remember if it's the lancer or i think it was i think it was lancet that i really recommend for people to read about how we understand now about immunity to this virus because it's related to this this aspect of reinfection um so but but i haven't seen any any new like really headlines on on reinfection after those those two cases that i mentioned the renal case and the hong kong case great thank you dr so thank you everyone for joining is really really happy and thank you so much to our subject matter experts this really excellent um uh session today just a couple of announcements before we leave again if you'd like to see me please um link go to the link in the chat i mean if you were unable to get your question in today please come back next week and we'll try to answer it at that point um the credit there's a critical care echo tele echo session on thursday it's now the first and third i believe anyway it's two times a month whatever this this upcoming um thursday is the the session is about hospital testing and reinfection and um dr megan brett is gonna give a talk during that echo so that should be good it's from eight to nine on thursday morning and um if you want additional information please go to the website and you can see what other echoes are available for you to join that are related to covid19 and with that i think we will close the session and thank you everyone for joining we'll see you in a week carla if i could make a brief request um ms leslie hayes what i'd really love to make a presentation on is a protocol for what we're going to do with all the snot and those little kids this winter if we're going to be testing every time the toddler gets a fever and runny nose which with my kids would have meant i was testing them twice a month and i cannot find a protocol anywhere so if anyone finds a protocol if you would send it to me i would be very grateful because i'd love to present something on that because i'm actually not quite sure how to approach that so yeah yeah absolutely let us know or marla if you have maybe martha's thought about this but maybe we can talk about it next week thank you everyone,,9/14/2020
20,is september 21st i'm joanna katzman it is the office hours infectious disease project echo with nestor sosa and leslie hayes and marla seavers and we're so happy to have you join us um my colleague carla thornton is on the line today carla if you can just say hello hi good afternoon everyone can you hear me yes great yeah hi carla florentine infectious diseases at great i'm a neurologist i work at a project echo in the unm pain center and um just a few housekeeping items just if you have the opportunity to turn on your camera your webcam if you haven't already done so that would be great and it's in line kind of with the echo model we can see you and you can see us and it provides for better uh learning and a better community of practice secondly um our digital librarian kent noseworthy will be leaving um evidence-guided journal articles and information that our our colleagues will be sharing with you he'll be doing that in the chat you can just copy and paste that information into the browser into your own browser as you please and then at about 45 minutes after the hour you should be getting a cme link um to obtain no cost cme for each hour that you come onto the echo network and even if you don't need the cme uh please fill it out you can provide feedback we do really look at this earnestly and take uh your feedback into serious consideration and finally uh please stay muted unless you uh unless we call on you because there is is a lot of noise sometimes in the background um just want to turn the it over to nestor sosa our our tried and true leader here um nestor i think you have a nestor's a is the chief of uh division of infectious diseases at unm and leads this program nestor thank you very much uh joanna and carla and we have karissa also from from tricor helping us so i feel more much more happy when i see their their faces today i'm going to bring a and i think it's an interesting update let me see if i can put it up in the screen okay share i can go to maximization okay there you go i think you can see it now so there's a lot of a lot of things happening both in the in the publication front and in the news but i'm gonna concentrate on some of the most recent publication something about long copy we have been you know discussing different papers and publications on these manifestations of kovit or after the acute uh event so i i thought it was interesting this this story it's out of austria they actually uh follow 86 patients patients who were relatively ill i mean they were all hospitalized with kobe 19 and they followed these patients for 6 12 and 24 weeks and they have just uh presented the results in a in a in a conference in europe and i want just to share these these um publication is still early because they have they just have uh follow up on six and 12 weeks it's a preliminary communication so the median age of this group of patients 61 they were um one out of five were in icu and they had a you know relatively uh common lengths of stay for for this disease for severe kobe 13 days and what they did they actually followed this patient after discharge and in this in the in the appointment at six weeks they found that 65 percent were still symptomatic so they were complaining of something the most common uh issue was still dyspnea in almost half of the patients and cough so respiratory symptoms were very prevalent this study was focused most mostly on cardiac and pulmonary symptoms um and then at 12 weeks still 54 of the patient had uh symptoms uh being the most common dyspnea but as you can see it had gone down from 47 to 39 of the of the cohort and cough was still persistent in the same 15 they did also pulmonary function test and you can see that you know more or less one third or a little bit less than that um abnormalities in the fed1 or diffusion of co or or vital capacity so there was evidence that that a significant proportion of this patient had that and the good news is that it improved you know from one third to more or less one in five but still at 12 weeks there were there were you know around 20 20 of the patient who had abnormal pulmonary function test if we look at the ct scan that we know that is very sensitive almost all of them 88 percent had an abnormal ct uh six weeks after this charge uh and it had gone down to 56 so apparently most of these infiltrate are reversible which is good news but still persistent three months out um for these for this patient and finally there was also some uh preliminary data on the six-week echo results and 58 percent so a little bit more than half had a left ventricular function decrease in the echocardiogram and they didn't mention the the results at all week i think they didn't they didn't have it in this preliminary so you know more data on the long covey the other story that i think even made it to the news was this uh i think out of ohio state in which they actually did a sophisticated imaging uh uh cardiac resonance imaging of the heart of 26 competitive athletes college athletes and they they found that 15 percent four of them had cmr or computer i'm sorry um cardiac magnetic resonance finding suggestions of myocarditis and a um had uh had also some inflammation in the myocardium evidence what was some of this the lge technique that they use so i think that they take home message is that at least from an imaging standpoint in this patient that were after the acute uh kobe athletes had some myocardial inflammation or pericardial inflammation uh so it's something that that it's uh being considered when when these uh athletes go back to to their usual athletic activities they probably need to be evaluated by by a cardiologist or have some type of of study the other the other important publication was about the multi-inflammatory syndrome i want to share with you three publications actually um there's a a systematic review that was it's very helpful for clinicians i'm not a pediatrician but for those who see children they actually summarize the clinical presentation the characteristics the complications of all that has been published up to now it was published in e-clinical media so i really encourage you to review if if you are interested in this multi-inflammatory syndrome i'm going to show you a couple of the of the images of that publication for those who like the immunology this is a more complicated more uh basic science type of article but they actually characterize the immuno phenotypes in children with this and compare it with other um with like acute kobe and it was you know they have some interesting interesting finding um and i i found this really useful from the clinical uh from the systematic review the difference between kawasaki disease which was the the what they thought this syndrome looked like at the beginning the similarities and the differences and some of the the differences obviously the age you can see that this is like an infant or small children as opposed to older children affected with the with the multi-inflammatory and then there were things that were really different there was more headache encephalitis and gi symptoms like vomiting and abdominal pain in those with the with the most inflammatory syndrome that is not very common in in small children with kawasaki disease and then the heart um kawasaki classically is complicated with coronary artery aneurysms and this is more myocarditis so so those were some of the difference but i found this this uh infographic very useful to to find the difference uh in in the clinical or systematic review they actually describe the course of this patient that have been published so they they summarize result of over 600 of these children and you can see 70 percent of them 71 percent uh made it to the icu so it was you know serious enough to to put them into the icu 60 percent had shock um 52 percent use vaso active regimen 39 require respiratory support the good news is that the mortality was really low i think it was 1.9 so relatively low for such a severe disease so that's that's that's good news uh from this publication and there was this third publication which published in cell in which they actually look in um into the immunology and they have discovered that probably this multi-inflammatory syndrome is it's been driven by auto antibodies so it's sort of an autoimmune reaction after the acute coming um this auto antibody seems to be um attacking some of the organs like the heart like the brain in these kids so i also invite you to review this pretty uh pro you know deep uh look at the at the immunology of this disease and they compare it with kawasaki and they found some differences and and also with the with the cobia with acute coping so it's a comparison of acute coping the the multi-inflammatory syndrome in kawasaki from a from an immunology standpoint another interesting data i think we discussed this in one of the previous office hours about vitamin d there was this study that i think i reviewed when it was in pre-publication it's actually from a group in the uk in which they actually look at 489 subjects that had in their in their database they have vitamin d level measured the year before kobe so this is pre-coding 2019 this patient because of their regular follow-up with their physician they had a vitamin d level and then they followed these cohorts of subjects in the uk and they found that those with vitamin d deficiency or low vitamin d had almost a two time higher risk of developing uh kobe 19. so there was that this was sort of the first um you know association but it was retrospective um and and uh so based on on those uh on that premise a group in spain did a very provocative really small story so so that's my my caveat with this story but it's interesting because the result was kind of striking they actually took 76 consecutive patients all with with um kobe at that time they were given hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin so everybody got this combination in spain during that time they randomized they did an electronic randomization uh upon admission to the hospital in a two to one ratio to give them vitamin d high dose of vitamin d versus no vitamin d and obviously plus standard of care which as i said at that point at that point was hydroxychloroquine and acetomycin in both groups in the vitamin d um and and no vitamin d they they actually use a pretty high uh dose of vitamin d they they use 0.5 milligram which i calculated is equivalent to 20 of my of my center and silver pills so i have to take 20 uh center silver to achieve these these those are 0.5 uh milligrams and what they did was and the results were really interesting um they follow this patient 50 patient receive the vitamin d 26 did not and only 2 of those so so one person require icu admission as opposed to 13 so half of them without vitamin d obviously a very large and statistically significant difference uh there was nobody die in the in in this 50 in this group of 50 patients to die in the group of no vitamin d so i think that the message is this is really small randomized story but requires like more um or larger stories uh hopefully double line uh placebo control to to actually test that hypothesis but i thought it was it was interesting and really provocative there was also an interesting publication in the mnwr a few days ago in which they they look at the at the risk factor for kobe in in a group of of patients in 11 outpatient health care centers in the us and they actually found two two factors that were associated or significantly associated with the risk of acquiring copy one obviously was close contact with a person with non-copy that's pretty obvious so if they had a relative or a family member or took care of a person with kobe they were at high risk but the other one was going to locations where on-site eating and drinking options were available so so interesting out of all the all the activities shopping being in the office um going to the gym et cetera using public transportation only going to a restaurant or going to a bar and a coffee shop where a statistical is significantly associated with um being positive for covered coveting this case control uh study so so interesting and something that sort of reinforces what we basically know it those are areas where you remove your mask and you talk and you and you uh you're close to other people and and sometimes you are also in close uh buildings or closed uh rooms to do those activities something new on testing that i found really interesting i don't know if people follow the literature i have followed this crisper cast enzyme that that actually is a it's a it's an insulin that was discovered to edit dna and it has been uh you know um used for for like genetic treatment etc but now they're using it for diagnosis so this investigator actually combined this technology crisp with without another diagnostic technology called lamp and they published their results and they call it um sherlock one-stop uh one-part story testing and they they they said that they can result they can get results that are almost as good as the pcr in one hour and uses this you know noble technology the crispr which is i put what the acronym means and lamp and then sherlock and they call it stop which is chair look testing in one part the name of the test um and what they found was essentially the sensitivity of this new technology was 93 percent compared with pcr and the specificity 98.5 so a promising new uh technology i don't know how far it's going to go when it was it was published in the in the in the new england journal of medicine so so at least uh uh it was worth the that that uh highly renowned publication and in the paper i'm not going to go into this because i'm not a lab person they actually put an illustration how quote-unquote easy was this technology according to them or easily compared with other uh more conventional uh testing and rapid that it was available in one hour and they compare their you know the positivity with the pcr so really an interesting short interesting article and just to finish my last uh this was actually a paper suggested by by um our colleague that is going to have the update in a second by leslie but there was also an interesting um interesting paper it's out of china they actually look and it's something that i have thought of they look at a cohort of 276 hospitalization with kobe and they they notice that the frequency of of patients with myopia patients who use eyeglasses was much lower than the general population in china 31 of of subjects used glasses in that age group um and and there were only 5.8 percent uh copied patient wearing glasses so was much lower than the than the heat than the frequency in the population suggesting obviously an association between regular eye glasses and and um and kobe uh so that was that was i thought it was sort of interesting and curious uh finding so that that's that's my update on until now thanks let me start sharing thank you thank you so much dr sosa um incredible incredible incredible for these week weekly updates this tremendous amount of uh pre-work i i really appreciative and i know everybody else is really appreciate that given everything you're doing um i wanted to let everybody know and and you can see in the chat that we don't have our digital librarian today kent knows worthy but he should be back um next week he's doing a lot of training because we're doing so many other echoes now that he's training other people to do the same thing as him um so so sorry about that um i think uh wanted to um we're going to take questions for dr sosa's talk in a few minutes but want to turn it over now to leslie hayes has um a very brief talk as well hang on just a second okay i just had a couple things um first was last week there was a lot of questions about dental care so i actually went through the dr hayes yeah do you want to maybe your volume is quite low oh i'm not sure how i fixed that is this any better that's quite a lot better yeah okay so um there were a lot of questions about dental care last week so i just wanted to summarize i looked at guidelines from world health organization cdc and american dental association if there are any dentists out there there are some of this stuff that i really don't fully understand what it means so i'd be delighted to get input so world health organization on august 3rd came out with some guidelines and they basically advised against any routine non-essential oral health care including oral health checkups dental cleanings preventative care they said needs to be delayed until there's really substantially decreased rates of transmission in the community um they said you should definitely continue to do urgent or emergency oral health care interventions that are vital for preserving a person's oral functioning they have severe pain or quality of life they included acute oral infections swelling systemic infections significant or prolonged bleedings or severe pain that you can't get controlled otherwise cdc i gotta say these guidelines were pretty wishy-washy i was kind of disappointed in these they had you know paragraphs upon paragraphs about ppe um and the importance of it but as far as what services should actually be provided this was the sum total of what they said that we should prioritize the most critical dental services and provide care in a way that minimizes harm to patients and then consider if elective procedures surgeries and non-urgent outpatient visits should be postponed so don't know whether or not that means you shouldn't get your dental cleaning like i said it was very very um not clear from their guidelines they did um definitely recommend infection control goggles for all dental health care workers masks social distancing screening i thought this was an interesting thing they said it was very important that all dental clinics have reasonable sick leave policies so that if someone did get covet they can actually take time off and then one patient at a time in the clinic um the cdc did recommend avoiding aerosol generating procedures which and this is where i was hoping a dentist might be able to clarify um including the use of high speed dental hand pieces air and water syringes and ultrasonic scalers i don't know whether these are commonly used or if this is you know sort of a once a month thing um they did say if they do have an aerosol generating procedure you need to have four hands there to do high evacuation suction and dental downs just to minimize droplets batter and aerosols american dental association on the other hand said that oral health is an integral component of systemic health and that dentistry is an essential healthcare service um its role in evaluating diagnosing preventing and treating oral diseases that can affect systemic health and that essential dental care should continue to be delivered during the global pandemic and i got to admit i personally am kind of leaning towards the american dental association we have seen dr susa presented the paper a couple weeks ago about decreased diagnosis of cancer and we know that dental health care is really important and especially um if people have inflamed gums that's going to cause more inflammation throughout the body and that seems to be associated with covet outcomes if it was just going to be two or three months it'd be one thing but currently they're saying this may go on through the end of 2021 so i feel like that's too long to have people going without dental care so i'm kind of leaning towards the ada standpoint but i would be happy to hear other people's opinions on this then substance use disorder in cobit 19 this was a study um from molecular psychiatry and they looked at the um covid risk for people who were diagnosed with the substance use disorder i believe in the last six months to 12 months i can't remember exactly and it is really really high i would have guessed it was high i would never have guessed it was this high um overall the risk of uh getting um hospitalized for cobit was earth getting covered rather was 8.7 times as high if he had a substance use disorder it was actually highest for opioid use disorder where it was 10.2 times as high but all of them tobacco alcohol cocaine everything cause substantially increased rates of getting copied and then substantially worst outcomes and it is probably not just due to the substance use disorder as we know people with substance use disorder often have many other chronic illnesses uh both as a cause and as an effect but liver disease lung disease kidney disease type 2 diabetes obesity heart disease cancer and african americans unfortunately had significantly higher risk of covid than caucasians um even with both of them having substance use disorder it was about two times as high overall and for african americans with opioid use disorder they had a four time higher risk of getting covet than caucasians with opioid use disorder and unfortunately they had substantially worse outcomes if they had substance use disorder um almost 10 percent of them died 41 of them ended up hospitalized whereas the general coca-19 population was 6.6 died and 30 hospitalized and again unfortunately african americans with even worse outcomes uh if they had uh substance use disorder um they had 13 risk of death and 50 risk of hospitalization whereas caucasians it was only 8.6 and 35 risk of hospitalization and then just a couple papers on pregnancies these were both um morbidity mortality weekly reports from this week um the first was 598 hospitalized pregnant women with covet 55 were asymptomatic at admission um among the women who were symptomatic at admission they had significant illness uh 16 required intensive care admission um eight percent required mechanical ventilation and one percent died this is especially significant if you consider that these are generally young women that this is occurring in same study they had pregnancy losses of about two percent of all pregnancies um and quite high rate of preterm delivery preterm delivery was reported at 23 percent that number varies depending on where you are and they didn't give the baseline for this hospital but usually is around 10 percent um for women who are asymptomatic their rate of preterm delivery was only 8 percent and this was from vaccine safety datalink and i honestly they didn't describe it much more than that i don't know how they got this but they identified 105 pregnant women with covid and it was 2.4 of the pregnant women who came in again high rates of icu care um 13 of the women hospitalized required icu care um and if they were symptomatic from cobit then 30 of the women required icu care six of these women required mechanical ventilation and one woman died uh the rate of complications was much higher if they had been obese before getting pregnant and um it was also much higher if they were hospitalized for covet symptoms rather than the women hospitalized for obstetric reasons who were mostly asymptomatic um gestational diabetes was also much higher among women hospitalized for covid than women hospitalized just for obstetric reasons and of the outcomes um preterm delivery was 15 overall and 12 percent among live births which was percent higher than baseline rates and still birth present prevalence was three point two percent which was more than four times higher so i think for whatever reason early on it looked like covet was not going to significantly affect uh pregnant women i think the more we learn about it the more we learn it really has a substantial effect on uh pregnant women and we really need to take them uh take it seriously in pregnant women and especially during the third trimester do everything we can uh to keep these women from getting coveted so and that was all i had thank you thank you leslie thank you dr hayes so much now i'd like to see if a clarissa colbreath has any information regarding updates in in laboratory medicine regarding covid are you available yes i'm here um thank you no updates now but happy to answer any questions okay fantastic well there's a lot of questions from uh the chad and i'm going to turn it over to my colleague dr thornton great thank you joanna can you guys hear me okay i have one of these headsets that i never use okay good um excellent so deborah mcgrew had a great great question just about any clinical guidance on children or teens who are competitive athletes some with mild to moderate asthma had cobit and did not require medical care but they're now having it sounds like having decreased performance is there any indication for cardiology consultation i don't know nestor or leslie or yeah no i'm not aware of any official recommendation i see the comments around the papers that have been published that because of the concern with myocardialis with pulmonary issues i i do think i mean that this is my personal opinion on the opinion of many people that i have heard that that if if if an athlete had uh or children had a copy they probably it would be a good idea at least to take him to the pediatrician even if they're a federal and doing apparently well to see if they can you know make sure that in fact they have uh they have completely recovered their their their uh both cardiologically and and pulmonary wise but but i haven't seen any official publication but i haven't looked into that to be honest american academy of pediatrics actually had an official guideline that recommended if they have symptoms or if they had severe covet or if they are competitive athletes then they should definitely get an ekg before returning to sports and i'll just put in a brief plug you can also take them to your local family physician so thank you leslie excellent um i also just wanted to let everyone know so um elena is going to put the link to the pdf of the slides into the chat so you can get all the references off of those slides um so i know everyone's anxious to get those references um there was another leslie actually had a question about nestor the the study that you talked about where restaurants seem to be a higher risk if there was any um differentiation between people who were inside or outside no they no they didn't they didn't make a difference they included patios or indoor spaces they didn't go into that uh you know details and but they do mention in the article in the discussion that that there were some cases in which were outdoors eating too but they didn't differentiate or measure the differences between you know outdoor and indoor eating okay great thank you and um dan saltman maybe you can unmute yourself you're just asking about particularly about transmission studies in the health care setting was that something specific or were you are you there can you unmute yourself yeah there we go uh i was just i know there's been some i was wondering if there's any uh recent uh you know more recent where they've uh just just is it still you know is there a risk to going to see your doctor that kind of that kind of thing risk risk to going to visit your visit the health care setting as a patient yeah there's a recent paper um published uh i'm trying to remember which journal but it was on the uh brigham and women's uh hospital in in boston in which they actually showed a very very very low extremely low transmission rate for patients in that hospital but they they describe in detail all the measures that they took and they had i think out of a total of 9 000 patients during the the peak of the epidemic in boston they only had two probable hospital acquiring infection and one of those two was uh the spouse visited the patient in the hospital and probably infected the person so very low numbers they took care of around 700 copied patients in that hospital during that period of study and there were only two maybe only one uh actual patient who who acquired the disease in the hospital so it was pretty safe and that's one of the issues that they actually raised that that you should not postpone your care because of fear of covet and that that that's what they uh one of the conclusions of the of their study but this was obviously in a in a very um you know intensive situation they did everything you know under the sun to try to decrease nosocomial or hospital transmission of kobe from universal masking to to having individual rooms with negative pressure et cetera to all the coffee patients but it was interesting that they were able to almost you know bring it down to zero almost zero transmission let's say did you have any other comments about that from the primary care side yeah they're definitely there have been some primary care studies recently that have showed um low transmission rates there was one looking at pregnant women admitted to the hospital um and they had identical rates of covet positivity regardless of whether they'd been having in clinic or telehealth visits so um that was reassuring and then there was another one i've forgotten but i will track down um so yeah and regarding healthcare workers i mean that that's that paper was mostly the socomia transmission of copied between patients or from house healthcare healthcare workers to patients but there was also a little bit of order study on on transmission uh within healthcare workers from from the mass general and they also found that the the universal masking decreased significantly the positivity of healthcare workers so so since they started doing using universal masking in the hospital the the transmission was also pretty low um and and in a study from new york the zero prevalence of of kobe among healthcare workers was very similar to the community so apparently it was the the hospital was not a driver of the infection as much as the as being part of the community that that was having a high kobe 19 transmission there was one from this last week and i'm going to see if i can track it down but one of the things that i thought was interesting was the people who were actually at most risk were housekeeping thank you thank you leslie um i think nestor in the vitamin d study that you talked about or i don't know in the first vitamin d study presented was it known whether vitamin d supplementation was taken or or not by those who had their vitamin d levels checked no that i i mean what they did is it's they look into the uk database and they had they had um they had this group of people who who had a pretty recent uh vitamin d level and they and they just look they just look at when when they develop kobe if if there were more patients with the you know with low vitamin d that develop kobe than those who did not and they found this 1.77 times risk of of acquiring kobe in those who had a pre-existing low vitamin d but i i don't remember i mean this is a paper that was published a few weeks ago i don't remember if they actually treated or not treated the vitamin d but it was just an association between having a low level in your like last doctor visit the year before kobi and then having a higher risk of acquiring coffee it was sort of a pilot uh retrospective association um that that's as far as i remember thank you nestor and leslie um just some clarification on the substance use data that you looked at um is there was there an increase in the number of people getting covered out of substance use or in having severe covet illness or both both they were much more likely to get coveted and then they were much more likely to get severely ill and they were much more likely to die if they had substance use disorders so yeah thank you very very alarming data actually um and then um there is a question i don't know if anyone knows this but if wearing glasses can protect from infection like wearing a face shield or if there's any head-to-head studies or information nestor do you know no actually this is the first study that i that i see associating eyeglasses and it's a it's a relatively small story so i would be careful to extrapolate that too and they are just comparing with the general population in china so there may be other confounding factors that we are not looking at and actually that protection is it's not directly related to the eye glasses but you know it makes sense it's possible but i think we need you know more studies from other countries other situations to to be able to generalize but thank you very much i was looking to see if we had any testing questions because i want to utilize um expertise we didn't have a lot on um on the pre-registration but carissa can you just can you just talk about the rapid test and where we are at with with those that testing here in new mexico i'm sure so there are some rapid antigen tests that have become available many of them have been acquired by the federal government and are being distributed throughout systems with a large focus on nursing home and elderly care populations in the meantime there are some rapid tests that are available for the public to use and in general they have decent performance as we would expect from rapid tests in symptomatic populations and i know that the at least in the state of new mexico the medical advisory team is going to be putting out some guidance for use of rapid tests and then what to do in high or low prevalence settings or in high or low pretest probability for repeating of results if necessary and then i think the only other maybe testing thing to discuss um and maybe i can talk about it a little bit next week will be around testing for flu and respiratory viruses as we're entering into those seasons thank you chris that would be great um so yeah people have testing questions right now too please put them into the chat and we can we can ask carissa um there's a question from dan saltman um about what what do you make of the neurologic complications in the two patients from the trial of adenovirus vector stars kobe 2 vaccine um nestor do you have any thoughts about that no i mean it's it's it's worrisome i think there you know two cases it's uh and they have some similarities although in the first one they they said they diagnosed uh multiple sclerosis and the second one the final diagnosis seems to be transferred myolitis so i think we need to wait i mean they actually restarted the trial in many countries except for the us so i think we need to be just attentive and just look into into any other neurologic complications with this specific vaccine platform one thing that that it's that i have heard vaccinologists mention is that these adenovirus vaccines require very high doses of of virus because this is a non-replicative buyer so they they use billions of of viral particles so i don't know if that's somehow is associated with these uh neurologic but i think we need to wait and see and learn and be attentive to to to this this and the other mr adenovirus trials that are out there thanks joanna backed it back to you okay great thanks carla um thanks everybody for all these um amazing questions today and uh in in every session um thanks nestor um carissa uh there's some more testing questions i hope it's okay if i go back to you um there's a few questions regarding saliva testing any updates you could provide for us just in general and then um juanita asked some if you could comment on the saliva test technique that uses the specimen after it being heated um for testing directly if you could comment kind of on updates regarding saliva testing first first so um testing uh saliva samples has been um i think a um an interesting topic and and a kind of a popular topic it was especially necessary earlier in the pandemic when we had a limited supply of swabs and so we began to look for alternative specimen types saliva can work and so and it can have performance very similar to the nasopharyngeal swab what we see practically in the laboratory is that it seems to also have a higher rate of invalid results where we're not able to produce a result because of either unknown substances in the saliva sample that are inhibitory to the pcr activity and so when it works it works just about as well as the nasopharyngeal swab but we're seeing at least in our hands anywhere from a five to fifteen percent invalid rate and so that makes it a little bit difficult to figure out how to operationalize so that's a little bit of the behind the scenes challenges um with saliva sampling right now we do have enough in quotes enough i don't know what enough is but we have a good number of swabs available in the community and so although the nasal swab and nasal pharyngeal swab is certainly not the most comfortable oral pharyngeal swabs are just about as good as a nasal pharyngeal swab and sample a similar space and so if there's patients who are uncomfortable with getting a nasal pharyngeal swab there are options for nasal swabs or oral pharyngeal swabs which have um generally similar performance um and then and yes there are test processes one that was released by yale school of public health that had a a chemical digestion process that did not use an extraction kit um and that seemed to work fairly well although they in their performance data also did not mention the invalid rate so we're not clear on what uh that might be uh in those settings thanks carissa very very helpful um there's another kind of testing question and that is from pamela defern what what is the optimal time to test in an asymptomatic person who has a known exposure um might you try to may you answer that or perhaps nestor as well um i'll have to look um the the cdc guidance tends to change um frequently especially around this topic um so i'll have to look at the updated um guidance um but i think if this were if without a specific guidance from the cdc um i think in the three to five day time frame is probably a good idea and certainly using a pcr-based method not using antigen tests or um serology thanks chris and nestor do you have any comments on when might be an optimal time if someone is after someone's exposed no that's exactly what i remember i mean it has been you know gather from the from this mass exposure like in the in the cruise ship and other experiences we say they actually tested people and they found that between three to five days remember the incubation period way in the old days uh then the regular incubation period the medium time was around five days and and and we know that people excrete the virus 24 to 48 hours before they become symptomatic so we can extrapolate that to asymptomatic that probably around three to five days of the exposure they they should be already shedding the virus thank you both um i did want to call on you uh both carissa and nestor um there's several questions regarding kind of an update on vaccines both the general update as well as just kind of reassurance or worry about um kind of the the protocols going into the vaccination studies and if if there's been any shortcuts or any uh anything being compromised in terms of trying to push out a vaccine any vaccines too early um might you comment on that dr sosa yes yeah there have been some developments i mean first of all the the three leading companies uh modern pfizer and astro seneca uh released their protocol so so now the scientists around the world and here in the united states are able to to take a really a close look at the at the at the protocol i mean we had some ideas of what they were testing but now we can see the numbers what are they considering an effective vaccine uh how many people are they gonna enroll how many events meaning infections they're gonna consider in order to call uh uh you know the trial a success or a failure uh if if i can if i can share my screen i don't know if i can share my screen i can show you this was presented by dr um eric topple from the screen yes uh institute let me see if i can please go ahead just one second because i had it after the presentation because but i wasn't sure if i was going to have time to do that let me just show you what he presented just one second here swap and then go to the network so so these are the details that actually dr topple put in a in a slide and i just simply copied from his twitter his twitter feed uh so pfizer actually is talking about 44 000 but but in the in the protocol they plan to enroll 30 well they're not 30 30 and and this is uh um the pfizer and modern are a one to one so half of the population will get the vaccine as opposed to astrazeneca which is a two to one so 20 000 will get the vaccine and you can see that the number of um of of interior analysis is four so they're going to stop the trial or at least not stop but look at the data four times for pfizer two for modern and one for astra seneca and and these are the number of events that they're gonna consider um necessary to do uh the interior analysis so they're gonna wait for like 32 infections 53 and 75 and they use obviously a statistical method not to compromise the scientific validity of the trial three different statistic methods to do the stop and analyze or do an entering analysis with their data safety monitoring board so so at least we are getting you know more information obviously this is sort of a complicated uh statistical and research thing but but people are going to comment in the next few days on this data and the other interesting aspect is how what what are they considering a case and these are the criteria they're similar but not identical i mean some of them require uh just one symptom one fever or or cough or shortness of breath or sore throat and and others require um you know other more specific things like loss of smell and things so they are not identical in the way they're calling a positive occasion so so it's gonna be interesting to see how these uh develop in the in the real life so so that's basically the update i think we have to wait a few days for for the scientific community to actually digest this information and make comments um and do analysis of what this uh these protocols actually reveal obviously the concern of everybody is that they're gonna stop the trial uh when they get these 53 and you're probably going to have some hints on efficacy but then safety especially long-term safety it's in my opinion it's not going to be that easy i mean if you stop in october a trial that started in august it's probably not long enough to see some other delay uh delay onset complication but it's it's something that it's up for you know for discussion and we're going to see in the next few weeks how this this issue develop in the in the scientific community here in usa and as i said all over the world um thank you nestor a few questions my understanding is that these trials are not testing not only are they not testing uh uh people younger than 18 but my understanding is that they're also not testing folks older than uh 50 54. is that correct or is so they're just getting a very uh you know middle they're they're not getting the younger age group in the older age groups is that correct yeah that is correct definitely no children in these early trials um and and some of them go up to 65 to age 65 i remember correctly but you're right i mean they're they're testing a very uh sort of narrow uh population initially they're obviously uh planning other trials with other groups for for the for the future but i think they want to get the data from these these groups and my understanding nestor this is joanna again is that the trials are in terms of ethnicities are not that uh diverse as well over right i have seen that comment obviously on on the press that they are having issues with minorities but i mean they're running these trials in brazil they're running in other countries so i hope that the enrollment in these other countries will give the the you know racial or ethnic diversity that they need um i mean brazil is a very diverse country i've been there many times and and i can tell you there are people from german descent from africa and descent and and also native americans so it's it's a very very mixed uh population so if they enroll a lot of people in latin america or in some other areas they're probably going to get some diversity but we we have to wait but i know that they they have mentioned that that they're they're predominant especially in the uk are usually caucasians or white people as opposed to other ethnic or racial groups thank you so much for this this update um carissa any any more information on the vaccines that you want to add to dr sosa no i don't have anything to add great great um i just want to go back up to a question that phil hertzman had regarding kind of a face uh mouth and nose coverings um he said the original report about neck gaitors were ineffective but now these gators are available with that have they come in five layers with filters and different fabrics and wanted to know if there's any new information on these um have you heard anything nestor or leslie not on my front i haven't seen anything okay great um and then um i want to turn now to some of the the pre-registration questions then i'll turn it back over to dr thornton um just in terms of some of the treatments um this is from elaine gouche from albuquerque have new mexico hospitals been using dexamethasone or similar drugs in severe cases and what are kind of the latest treatments for for patients in icu's settings right now nestor right it's been a while since i have talked to my colleagues in the icu so i i just i'm just gonna reproduce what i have talked to dr harkins and they are using in some cases in severe cases they're using dexamethasone according to what what the recovery trials show that it's not useful early really early in the disease but actually people who have been you know for more than seven days and definitely those who require oxygen or high flow oxygen or ventilatory support uh that's that's as much as i can say i'm i do not work in the icu and unfortunately our numbers of icu patients copy patient has really decreased in the last couple of of months so so we're not seeing that many and and we're uh treating most of the patients in the in the outpatient setting or in the regular medicine works we are doing the the act three trial that uses foreign interferons so so we're actually trying to include as many patients as possible in these rendezvous uh plus minus interference trial um and we follow them then uh as outpatient when they when they recover and and go home so so that's what we've really been doing uh lately but i know they're using dexamethasone for severe cases because i've seen the discussions of the hospitalists on that topic thank you so much dr sosa there's a question from ahmed mama i think carissa for you perhaps uh talking about um the the oropharyngeal test versus the nasopharyngeal swab i want to see if you could comment on that but before you do i just wanted to remind of folks about two things one is the cme link that went into the chat at about uh 46 minutes after the hour 12 46 mountain time and also to dr souza's powerpoint uh at about uh at 12 25 or about 25 minutes after the um hour and i'm wondering um i'm hoping that we can maybe get uh dr hayes powerpoint into the chat as well but carissa do you have any comments from uh dr mama's um question yeah so it looks like the question is about the risk for health care workers when collecting the samples so certainly the nasopharyngeal swab is the aerosol considered a aerosol generating procedure and so in 95 masks and other containment is required nasal swabs tend to have a bit of a less a lesser risk but they also can be a self-collected swab so the nasal swabs can be collected as a self-collect nasal um and so that can significantly decrease the risk to the healthcare worker if the patient can collect the sample away from the healthcare worker with either appropriate distance or the person being in their own vehicle and i believe the oropharyngeal swab although not generally a self-collect is less likely to produce aerosols and so trying to find additional options other than the nasopharyngeal swab that can also protect our healthcare workers is very important for specimen collection thanks carissa so so much back to you carla thank you very much and um yeah uh leslie hayes slides women about 12 30 and she's just elena just put them back in and then put the cme link again so so everything should be in the all the links should be in the in the chat at this point so i had a question actually i wanted to see um harry sybold are you still on do you have a do you have a microphone hello yes i'm here yeah so harry just can you just you had asked a question just for chris about the testing can you be a little bit more specific about what you're interested in hearing about and introduce yourself please oh sure my name is harry seibold i'm an emergency physician ems physician from helena montana and a consultant with the u.s forest service out on fires right now the new cdc guidelines talk about testing all contacts of any known covid patient even if they are asymptomatic which has a significant potential impact on my mission here and i'm wondering kind of what all of you that that are involved in testing or public health any of those fields feel about how that's going to affect your choice of testing capacity for testing and the ability to to live up to that standard so to speak because i think that's going to suddenly decrease or excuse me massively increase our impact on on testing that will be required after contact tracing thanks harry carissa do you have any comments yeah thank you that's a great question um this is one that i wish marla was here for with the the contact tracing piece but i think to the testing side of this for asymptomatic uh individuals we really have to use the pcr for uh for testing and i i think this is where understanding what the the pcr testing that's happening in your area um and what the current testing capacity is really becomes important if this is an area of the country where they're experiencing much longer turnaround times then it may not be significant value to test everybody if you may not get the results back for 10 days or something like that right now here in new mexico our turnaround times are much shorter than that um but we're certainly not looking to increase those turnaround times um so i think one working with the laboratory understanding what the testing capacity is and you know what what those turnaround times would be to make sure that the results are coming out in an actionable time frame would be very important but i would have to rely on my public health and epidemiology colleagues to get a better understanding of who within those contacts should be um tested thank you kristin it looks like i know marla had to drop off but it looked like you're back on marla are you yeah i'm good hi hi go ahead um so cdc did recently you know update that guidance after sort of backing away from that guidance several weeks ago um but that has really been our recommendation here in new mexico all along is that people who had prolonged close contact with confirmed cases be tested so we've encouraged contacts even asymptomatic contacts to be tested here in new mexico sort of all along we haven't adjusted that guidance based upon you know cdc's back and forth about that luckily here in new mexico which i think is in contrast to many states most of our testing happens here in the state of new mexico either at tricor or at our state public health lab so we've not been as impacted as some of the other states by having to send all of our pcrs out uh to the big reference labs out of state like labcorp or quest so we've been very fortunate that we've been able to you know turn our tests around in time um to make the information useful and actionable but i realize that that's not the case everywhere carla can i ask a question this leslie hayes the one i have frequently is the person who's sort of a contact they were you know six feet from somebody and they were masked but they were in the same room for 30 minutes or they had somebody who later tested positive spend three minutes on their front porch dropping off a package so they don't really meet criterias of contact but they're understandably nervous and want to get tested my question is do they need to quarantine until they get results and do they need to quarantine the full 14 days so if people truly have an exposure you know using the guidelines we get lots of questions from people who are um think they're exposed to contacts of contacts so not even a primary exposure but it's like my neighbor's daughter was positive so am i exposed and should i get tested i was never exposed to the daughter but i did have a porch conversation with the neighbor for example you know and in those cases you know we do not encourage contacts of contacts um to get tested you know we really try to drill down when we're talking with folks to what constitutes an exposure and obviously if people are concerned um you know that maybe they were exposed they're not too certain about the time frame or the distance and they want to be tested we certainly encourage everyone um to be tested if they want to be tested again sort of a privileged position here in new mexico so we've not unless someone has a known close exposure or if they're symptomatic we've not recommended that they quarantine pending those results especially if they have sort of this more you know remote questionable exposure but it really is kind of a case-by-case discussion with uh cases and contacts to tease that out which we're you know always happy to do and people can call the hotline and talk to one of the great nurses who staff that and kind of walk through that if they're nervous and want some feedback great thank you so much marla so we just have one minute left but thank you to everybody who came on today and especially to well thank you to everyone and all to our subject matter experts thank you so much for spending the time with us um just a couple of announcements um there is a um first responder resiliency tele echo session this afternoon at two o'clock correct joanna correct two o'clock yeah two o'clock and also um the critical care echo as many of you may know has moved to two times per month and it's the first and the third thursday so there'll be one on october first from eight to nine if you have more cl um critical care related questions that would be great um and again the cme is in the chat we would love to hear your feedback or even if you don't want to see me we would still love to hear your feedback so please fill that out and if you have any uh if you looking for more information please go to the project echo webpage on covid19 and we'll see everyone next week thanks again,,9/21/2020
21,19 office hours really happy to see everybody today my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician and unm faculty member and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i'm just going to do some quick housekeeping announcements and then introduce the other members of our hub team so just um when you guys have all heard me say this or all of us say this over and over again but we love to see your faces and we like to build community we think it really helps to have to be able to see each other so if you have a camera and you can leave it on we would love to have you do that during the entire session we ask that you keep your microphone muted unless you're called on by one of the hub team members to speak please and we would also um ask you to put whatever questions you have into the chat box during the session and we'll try to get to as many as we can um we would also ask that you not unless unless we ask you to not to answer the questions in the chat unless they're directed at you specifically otherwise we may ask we may call on people but we'd ask you not to not to answer those questions in the chat and lastly our digital librarian or we'll be putting information into the chat box during the during the session so please keep an eye on that for a lot of good information and i think that's it i want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman john if you could just introduce yourself she'll be helping me co-facilitate i am joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i i work also at project echo and welcome everybody thank you joanna so i think um leslie i i don't see leslie is leslie hayes on she's not on yet okay we'll go to her second then um i'd like to introduce dr nester sosa and esther if you can introduce yourself and go ahead and give your update that would be great sure i'm nestor sosa an infectious disease division chief here at unm let me share my screen perfect okay let me let me start first of all i i like to mention and we have uh received a few questions in prior um office hours about the mutation or mutational rate of the of the stars kobe 2 and i wanted to to describe a little bit about the d614g mutation this is a substitution on in one amino acid in the spike protein um and it's uh it's it's been already observing many many countries and seems to be the predominant um mutation that is circulating in the in the world um and i'm gonna just show it a few things about it first of all this is the the percentage or frequency of of this mutation um that actually puts a glycine instead of aspartate in in position 614 in the protein and you can see that over the last uh you know since the beginning of the epidemic it rapidly became the most important or more frequent to the point that it's almost all of the isolates recently have this uh specific mutation so obviously the question about about this mutation is why so prevalent is the first question and does it changes anything about the the pathogenicity or the of the of the virulence or or or the transmissibility of the virus and i think we have uh already enough evidence to to answer some of those questions uh first of all about the the frequency why is the uh d614g the predominant um mutation were there two two like explanations there was this this uh review in in i think it was nature news about the coronavirus mutating and one possibility is simply the the so-called thunder effect that if if this one if this mutation if the virus with this mutation were uh introduced in in in different countries um it will become predominant but for that really uh that's not really what happened and what happened was actually the researchers think that it's more natural selection because this mutation seems to be associated with higher infectivity or or it is easier for the virus to enter cells and to infect cells and there are several lines of of evidence they they were early in the epidemic experiences using pseudo virus and it demonstrated that that these this mutated spike protein infected more cells also when when they were able to do when they have they had the bsl3 and they were able to do actual um experiments with the with the sars copy 2 this g mutation or d 64 d mutation produce higher levels in hamsters in animal models and then finally there was evidence in the uk that um actually they they study clusters with the original virus the d virus and with the g mutation um and when they when they look at the transmissibility in this cluster uh it was 20 percent faster it disseminated 20 percent faster when it had the gene mutation so so the the conclusion is that this this is probably due to natural selection because this mutation um the virus is fetus it's more fit for infection and one important um caveat is that it doesn't affect the severity so that's really important and it doesn't seem to affect the immunogenicity of the spike protein so it shouldn't affect vaccine or antibody production because it's not in the in the so-called rbd area where the where the antibodies actually um affect the the union of the of the virus and the most elegant explanation that that i found for this this is the place this is the protein first of all this is a spy protein spy protein has three uh it's a trimeric so it has three different uh protein chains and the spike protein is located here it's really not located in the in the rbd or or in the place where the protein joins the the ace2 receptor but it's important because one is present it opens the protein and you can see sort of an animation well it's not an animation but sort of a sequence here where it opens one of the arms the arm here is folded here is open then it open the the other part the posterior part here and finally the third one in orange here so when when that mutation is present in the in these proteins the protein takes this three-dimensional structure that is actually easier to join the receptor or to to uh to uh to have the the infection of the cell so so the the conclusion is so far is that this d4g substitution actually changes the conformational uh or the the three-dimensional uh structure of the protein and makes it more uh more effective or more um prone to to seek and and do the the union with the receptors so i thought it was it was an interesting explanation in this nature review um and why why is this the uh mutation more common changing gears completely that you have heard and i think we have asked also and discussed about the possibility of doing um pcrs of wastewater and there's actually this field for they have evolved for many years the so-called wastewater based epidemiology that have been used for rotavirus for norovirus and others um but as you know uh sars kobe 2 is also present in the in the in the stool so in in in terry it can also be detected in wastewater and the interesting finding is that that we are you know gathering more information that it may be used as an early uh detection tool because there there are a couple of studies that have actually shown that you can detect the the virus or by pcr in the wastewater a couple of days or a few days before there's actually uh an increase in cases increasing hospitalization and there are two stories one from spain and both show the same finding slightly different uh technique to determine the virus but they actually this was done in a region in spain called murcia in which they actually detected and this is the on top here are the the moments where they detected the virus in different cities in in different moments during the the first way of the epidemic in spain and and what they concluded is that they detected the virus in the in the wastewater before the actual increasing cases in the community so so it was sort of an early an early uh detection or an early strategy to detect and you can see that you know here was around the 12th um 12th and 16th of march they were detecting this in the wastewater and really the system had not detected increase in the number of cases it was much later um almost 15 days later they actually detected the increasing cases which is this linear curve here on the right and and this has also been shown in the united states this is a study out of connecticut uh in which they actually uh did the same thing they they measured the the presence of sarskovi in the in in wastewater in in the community around the the connecticut and and and they actually um found that that the the isolation of or or actually the detection of the pcr um was two days ahead of the positive testing one to four days ahead of hospitalization and six to eight days ahead of of testing by reporting day so it was again an early and early finding so they were able to predict and you can see the graph here this is the linear and on the left and the logarithmic graph here the color graphs are the detections and you can see that the peak um in detection in the wastewater and were occurred before the peak in the in the different epidemiological or traditional epidemiological uh parameters so so it can be used as an early early predictor of what's going to happen in the communities right i thought it was interesting and there's a now a review on where space epidemiology also that talks about this so i wanted to just call your attention the other the other article that i want to bring is we have heard many times that about the aerosol transmission but most of the most of the data on aerosol transmission have been just detecting the virus by pcr uh not really culturing the buyer or having viable virus in the air this is one of the first publications out of the university of florida they actually did they had a two patient room uh kobe patient in in a single room and they put um in two different locations in the room they they they place these um you know devices that actually collect the air from the from the room and and they did both uh culture which is illustrated by these by the cytoplasm and they did pcr and genome sequencing and they were able to show that that the virus present in one of those positive patients was actually viable they were able to collect it and when they analyzed the sequence it was exactly identical to one of the patients and and it was detected as far as almost five meters away from the patient so so this um study sort of um documents not only the detection by by uh by by pcr but actually culture from the from the aerosol in this hospital room in in uh in one of the hospitals in florida sorry funny was interesting and then there's another there's there's been another case of uh ray infection i know we're following we have heard about the case in reno uh nevada case in hong kong which was in cid and now this is the third that i'm that i that i am aware of the third case and this i think it was in virginia and and this also was similar to the to the to the case in reno in which the patient the first episode was milder than the second one and you can see by the by the number of boxes with different symptoms um the patient had much more um shortness of breath myalgias and other symptoms cough was more persistent so he had a more severe um infection in this the second time around and they were able to partially sequence the first virus and sequence the second virus and they found enough difference to conclude that in fact this was not a like a long copy there was actually a re-infection so at least we have three uh you know documentary infections and and they're probably more i i saw a news uh news outlet informing of 16 cases but i haven't really seen the publication maybe they are in people pre-publication but at least we have three well-documented uh cases of reinfection which is important and as you know uh some other coronavirus endemic coronaviruses do produce repeated infections every one or two years so it's not completely uh impossible that this is going to be a a phenomenon in in with with star scoby too finally and this is more more a curiosity um i think we have at some point talk about the if you remember the infection of the of the tigers and lions in the in the in the zoo in new york uh where there's more data now that which animals can be either experimentally or accidentally infected with sarcoby too the ones that we knew until now um that have been infected mostly experimentally are the shrew marmoset which is a small prime metal rabbits that have been used in the laboratory hamster and non-human primate also the the tigers in new york and some other felids domestic ferrets at home dogs can also be infected and obviously the the fruit bat which is probably the origin of the most similar um uh similar virus to to this sars copy too but what i what i found interesting though they have been recently reported outbreak uh in in in mink uh mink's farm in the netherlands at least 16 and they reported this in their this is the equivalent to the to the mmwr euro surveillance report they they they have reported 16 min farms um with animals and humans infected and they did whole genome sequencing on these and found a significant proportion of animals and also in 16 different um mink farms that are used for mix are used for fur and you can this table is from the publication they actually describe all the farms the 16th farm here they just number one two through 16 um when the animals were infected and humans by pcr and so early and their conclusion was that at least 68 percent of the humans related to this foreign were also infected so so their conclusion is that initially humans pass the disease to minks and then minks infected also uh farmers in these in this area so it's the first time that we clearly document this two-way transmission uh uh from human to these farm animals and then farm animals to to other humans and obviously they did a genome sequencing and you can see that in in the distribution of the the phallogenetic tree they're very similar human and mink isolate so so that's why they concluded that this is this is actually a two-way infection really very interesting and i also looked in wikipedia and there are mink farms in the united states so i think this is something that probably people are going to be looked uh into uh very soon and an obvious measure have to to to be taken and just one one slide i found this in in bloomberg opinion uh it's not an article it's not a paper but it comes from the from a work that are doing in indiana university with a survey of postcode uh symptoms a group of of patients that have copied actually has responded this survey and it's i mean this is a really loaded but it's very very interesting all the symptoms that have been reported obviously some are more frequent like fatigue inability to be active difficulty concentrating but i thought it was a nice a nice um illustration of all the symptoms almost to print uh a poster to have it in the office and and i put the link here to the news and i actually it didn't fit in one slide so i have to split it in half cut it and paste it so i could put it in a single in a single that's what i thought it was interesting um to talk about this and then just one news report there's there have been one story using tosilisumab the il-6 inhibitor and and this is not a trial it's actually a news release by the manufacturer and they they apparently this toshili zuma stole is the first one that actually shows uh decreasing the in the intubation and pneumonia but no incidence immortality so so we have to wait for the publication but it is the first um uh story with toscilisma really well done uh placebo control that showed and multi-center that showed efficacy at least decreasing decreasing mechanical ventilation in patients with with the severe copy and i think i'm going to leave it there this is the press release of the same i want to start sharing sorry that i took more time but it was i think there were a couple of interesting things and different fields joanna thank you so much nestor um i'm gonna actually before we answer any go to any of those questions go to dr leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself and share your slides because i know you can't stay for the whole session yeah thank you dr leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine in espanola and um and i just had a few slides i was going to talk on aap released an updated guideline on sports and i didn't talk about but one of the things they talked about extensively was whether or not kids should even be doing sports and basically it kind of boiled down to sports are good covett is bad we don't know how much covet is transmitted and use your best judgment i mean they really it was hard to come up with a definite thing they did talk about masks and they said all of the adults around them should definitely be wearing mask coaches officials spectators anybody else should be wearing masks and should be social distancing athletes definitely need to wear on the sidelines and if they're walking on and off the field anything like that they should be wearing masks but they did recommend against the athletes wearing masks during vigorous exercise if they're doing water exercise or if it's something like gymnastics where the mask may get caught on equipment and then these recommendations were really a lot stronger on you really need to follow up on athlete's heart if they get covid19 they said anyone with severe disease you just have to assume they had myocarditis and you need to keep them out of exercise for three to six months and they need a cardiac workup before they return to play anybody with moderate symptoms has to be asymptomatic for at least 14 days and they said these people need to obtain clearance from their primary care provider before returning to exercise and they said to really strongly consider an ekg and they said even for asymptomatic no play for 14 days and then they said they really strongly encourage evaluation by their primary care provider for possible cardiac symptoms and even sort of consider an ekg even if they're asymptomatic just because the incidence of myocarditis is high enough and you know the outcome be bad enough that we really want to be catching that and then the other thing they said is just to acknowledge sort of the difficulty and the effect this may have on the athlete if they're not able to participate for many kids this is you know one of their primary sources of pride and joy and it's very hard especially for kids who are missing milestone events where this was their senior year they were going to be the football star or they're missing out on the volleyball championships any of these i think it's just important to sort of acknowledge and work with the kids on that and then cdc has canceled halloween i was very sad about this i was hoping that there would be a way to safely do halloween but they really said traditional trick-or-treating or trunk or treating is just not going to be safe they suggested leaving goodie bags on a table in the yard or at the end of the driveway any costume party should be outside they did say costume masks are not adequate for protection should not be worn with cloth masks so really no costume masks and then to avoid indoor haunted houses i love this especially if there would be screaming they said you did not want to go to any indoor haunted house with screaming and then this is an article from marla sivers that's a mmwr report from last week about um covet 19 mortality and kids there were 108 correction 121 deaths reported that the cdc among persons less than 21. of those about 10 were infants and 70 were between 10 to 20 so definitely the age group from 10 to 20 is much higher risk and then infants as well and unfortunately children of color accounted for vast majority of these deaths um a fourth of them were previously healthy with no underlying conditions at all so um even healthy kids can get very sick it's pretty rare but it can happen a fourth had at least one underlying condition and almost half had two or more underlying conditions the most common were lung disease including asthma obesity neurological and developmental conditions and cardiovascular conditions a third of the correction two-thirds occurred during hospital admission but a third were not in a hospital at the time they died which i think states how quickly these kids can get very very sick 16 of them died at home and then 23 of them actually were critically ill and denied in the emergency room before they could get up to the floor so just to keep in mind these kids can change rapidly if you have any concerns i would hospitalize them early and then the last one i was finally able to find a guideline on what to do first not those little kids um this is from minnesota department of health and i think minnesota department of health is generally pretty good and i got to admit i was a little discouraged looking at these guidelines because i don't know about the rest of you but my children would have been home 75 of the time going by these guidelines but i do think they're fairly good guidelines they talk about sort of the more common symptoms being fever greater than 100.4 nuance that are worsening cough difficulty breathing and then loss of taste or smell and then the less common symptoms such as sore throat nausea vomiting diarrhea chills muscle pain fatigue headache nasal congestion or runny nose and they said for students with one less common symptoms evaluate them and decide if they're well enough to attend um if they're not well enough they need to stay home and they probably need to get a covet test or else stay home for 10 days if they have one of the more common symptoms from covid or two less common symptoms they stay home and they need to be evaluated by a health care provider or else they need to be home for 10 days and if they have a negative covid test or an alternative diagnosis they're allowed to return to school 24 hours after their symptoms are improved but if they don't get the test or have a positive cova test they're out for 10 days and then they also talk about what to do with someone who tests positive so i thought it was a fairly good guideline but like i said unfortunately looking at it i think we're going to have a lot of kids out a lot of the time following these guidelines and i'm not sure any way to get around that so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie that was great um i just want to introduce our other hub team members and then we'll move into the questions because it sounds like people it looks like people have a lot of questions uh marla can you just introduce yourself please sure hi good afternoon everyone marla siebers i'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at new mexico department of health thank you marla and carissa hi charissa colbreath um medical director for infectious disease at tricor labs thanks thank you chris and you didn't have an update today correct that's correct great thank you so we'll just move into the questions and um joanna i'm going to turn it over to you great thanks carla joanna katzman here um i'd like to start with uh heather brislen um dr brison are you available to unmute and ask your question you had one of the first questions and if you could ask it early on maybe to dr sosa or marla or carissa be great um i just wasn't sure this was the first study that you spoke of dr sosa about the protein mutation that's become dominant and i didn't i'm not sure i've heard you right but it's i thought the point was that this mutation allowed the virus to sort of out-compete all the other viruses but maybe wasn't by itself more virulent meaning didn't have an infectious advantage but i'm not sure understood that right yeah thank you for the quest question that that is correct i mean it increases the infectivity not the virulence so the studies in the uk and other have not been able to associate with more severe disease um so it seems just to spread rapidly and the explanation is because it it increases uh or it's easier for the virus to attach to the cells and infect the cells but it doesn't make the the disease worse so far and and and it has become the predominant because of that most people think that it gives the virus a slight advantage and that's enough for the the you know the rules of evolution to to be present and to to help them you know be more more frequent got it thank you uh thanks dr brisson for the great question thanks dr sosa um then there's a number of questions dr sosa about that your uh study your wastewater studies and and dona or orgaron um said can we consider this pool testing and probably no pun intended and i'm wondering marla can you elaborate on is that the wastewater um is this kind of concept uh not dissimilar to pool testing must be a pretty dirty pool yeah a really dirty pool um and since carissa is on i'll let her talk about pool testing i won't um attempt to explain that with my very limited understanding but um for pool testing you're still you know typically it's still a diagnostic tool so you're getting individual results and people are being individually sampled and then those samples are being pooled in the laboratory so the pooling is happening on the laboratory side but you still have an individual patient sample and an individual patient result unlike the wastewater sampling which is really more of a passive surveillance system obviously those pot you know if you found the virus in sewage you're not going to link that back um to individual um um people who contributed samples to that pool um but it's an early indicator that you have infection present and you know it can be used for a public health response sending you a signal that you need to deploy messaging testing contact tracing and other resources to that location so it can give you a little bit of a head start before your first clinical case is identified great think thanks marla and i think it leads to possibly uh deborah mcgrew's question deborah do you want to unmute and ask your question i think it relates to the study that from spain that dr sosa um commented on yeah sure thank you yeah i just wonder um are we does that imply then should we reasonably deduce that people are shedding this virus asymptomatically for a few days in their feces um before they really have any symptoms or are we assuming that or do we know are they sort of mildly symptomatic i mean i'd kind of like to know clinically if there's any information on what that might lead us to to to think thanks debra yeah right yeah i think it's it's sort of uh um you know it's like an early sign i mean when when you start having people uh shedding the virus um you can detect it in the in the sewage water they use obviously a very sensitive technology to be able to concentrate and detect the rna of the virus and that probably occurs just a few days before you actually see a noticeable increase in the number of hospitalizations and admission so it's just sort of an early sign because yes presymptomatic people asymptomatic people excrete the virus they're probably present in their you know saliva uh and and also stools and it goes into the into the wastewater uh pulling probably a little bit earlier then you notice from the reporting you know side of things uh you actually report and add and analyze the data and then you say okay we have an outbreak in this community but probably the the people who were testing the the wastewater detected it you know a couple of days earlier just because of that because of the of the rapidity in which they can do it as opposed to to the epidemiologies will will take up you know a few days to do the testing get the testing result analyzer is all added and then report it so so that's that's the what they explain especially in the connecticut uh paper that it was probably just a couple of days earlier than actual reporting system that official reporting system i don't know if marla thinks about the same yeah i agree i don't have anything to add thank thanks nestor and marla um leslie hayes i think had to sign off a little bit early but this there's some questions that might be applicable to carissa and the other hub team members um as well um leslie asks some does the reinfection nestor you mention that there were some cases now of reinfection and leslie asks does the reinfection have any implication for how effective vaccines will be um and there's also another question from kim joy will the mutation affect vaccine effectiveness and i wonder nestor if you or karissa might be able to weigh in on these two questions yeah let me think about the vaccine uh the i mean so far the area the rbd the area where the antibodies uh attached to the spike protein as far as i have read so far there hasn't been a significant mutation that alters the antigenicity of the protein that doesn't mean that the protein doesn't mutate or doesn't change it does change and obviously the clades and many other differences genetic difference between the different virus circulating different population obviously tells you that but so far there's no evidence a significant change in the antigenicity which is what determines both immune response or immune efficacy and also vaccine response that doesn't mean that it's not going to happen but so far that area that uh area that that it's critical to the attachment to the h2 receptor hasn't changed significant and and that's why people are still hopeful that the vaccines will will be effective even if you don't do the vaccine with the exact uh protein that that it's circulating in your community um so that that's regarding that aspect the reinfections obviously um it's a concern for for for vaccines it's like the ultimate concern and and we have to remember that coronaviruses endemic coronaviruses usually are associated with multiple infections as soon as a year uh you know you can you can have a second core endemic coronavirus uh common cold um by one of the one of the the old coronaviruses so it's it's entirely possible that with time the immune response to to these virus will will go down will wane and you can have a second infection we are somewhat surprised that this has happened already in a few months for these few patients but remember these are few patients even if it's 16 patients it's 16 again 30 million cases of coronavirus are still small percentage of cases but we are seeing this reinfection and we don't know why it's happening if it's something particular to the subject that has some immune deficiency or something related to the change in the antigenicity of the virus we don't really know we just know that they have two infection and they seem to be different different clades of the virus that's that's as far as we can we can tell with the with the very uh scan literature so far thanks nestor carissa do you do you want to weigh in on either of these questions and and there's a couple more questions one was so nestor do you think that the secondary infection on these 16 patients was from a different mutation that's what i'm yeah the way they're defining at least three that i have read the 16 i saw in a news release but the three they have make an effort to try to sequence the the first virus and the second virus and they have some criteria there they have enough amino acid substitution in the in their proteins so they can they can conclude that they are they seem to be different clades or different types of wires they're not identical if it were identical then you cannot you cannot say for sure that it's a reinfection it could be a long copy or somebody who hasn't been able to clear the infection maybe if you actually see you know one clay let's say a d and then a g in that position six six one four then you you can say okay this is this is really a different virus that this person uh was infected with so so that that that's what they are actually using as a definition of ray infection in the publications to distinguish it from just long-term call because you can isolate the virus for a few days in a single patient and doesn't doesn't mean that they have reinfection that would be just long long copy more than but more than a reinfection thanks nestor karissa no i think that was actually really great i don't have anything to add great thank you um i'll just ask one more question and turn it back to carla um i uh uh dr seibold asks um wanted to ask um if this affects um the if kind of this new secondary infection might affect the rep cdc recommendations on the retest and wanted to get your thinking on that if the new recommendations are uh no no retesting for 90 days right that's a good question i mean i don't think it has changed anything so far and marla can can make sure that i'm not making something up here uh but but it's you know it's it's and again it's it's so it's so me so few cases i mean we're talking three as opposed to millions of people with just one infection so so i think we need to be you know to wait and see if this is a very common event or a very uncommon event before we actually change policies and diagnostic policies great um okay carla back to you thanks joanna um it was a hard question any comments on the recent cdc information which was almost immediately withdrawn about the aerosol spread versus droplet spread i left that one for carla uh i know i don't i don't have any comments aside from the fact that i tweet i tweeted the the change and then everybody jump on my twitter and my spanish twitter account everybody jumped like you didn't see that they removed that what you said you know so it was that was sort of i was ashamed of of tweeting it too soon that was it but i have no code marla any insight yeah i we've been on a couple of calls with cdc obviously where this has come up and um they've just sort of repeated that there was some draft guidance that was uh posted a bit too early before it had been finalized um and i know that there was a call today um for um state epidemiologists where this was going to be discussed again so there apparently is some draft guidance that will be posted uh what that final document will look like we don't have a preview of um but their intent is to put up some additional information regarding aerosol transmission so we'll keep an eye out for it thank you thank you very much marla um harry siebold are you are you available to ask your question about your patient about that specific patient uh situation um yeah dr sosa this is a little bit of a riff on the question that we've already asked this actually came up today a real life incident i've got a person i have not met yet i've just started on a new fire he did test positive previously he's been here in an area of endemic cove it has not had a specific exposure in his asymptomatic but his family back home they've had a cluster of three outbreaks this is or three patients is these small counties in montana and is worried about her spouse bringing something home and he's requesting testing as i understand it within that 90-day period we still have a high risk of testing positive though that would add nothing to our diagnostic acumen because we would not believe that he's actually shedding infectious virus at that point does any any of these studies or any of our recent experience change that that recommendation that i would have made yesterday of you don't need testing this will just confuse the situation with a with a positive test that does not does not indicate your infectivity right yes as far as i know we haven't i mean we haven't really changed that uh indication and there's always the risk of yeah detecting remnants of of rna and that doesn't mean infectivity um i think as as we gather more information on the reinfection there may be a change to that but at this point i don't think we we would change anything and he will be considered you know an old infection or a new infection so i i don't know if marla you you you have anything to add yeah i agree you know um right now the guidance from cdc if a person doesn't have new symptoms which can't be explained by another diagnosis um you know the recommendation is that they not retest in that 90-day period because of that prolonged presence of virus for some people they can intermittently test positive for many weeks after their initial infection and so you know i think the concern would be if you got a positive test and a person with you know no symptoms and no known exposures um you know then you're kind of stuck trying to decide do you um isolate them again and treat it as an infection or not and so having that positive test just kind of confounds things and makes them more confusing rather than providing clarity which is what people want by doing that repeat testing but actually it's often the opposite that happens things become a little more confusing if his family was really concerned then the you know most conservative approach would be he could quarantine for 14 days when he went home and um you know maintain that distance from his family for that quarantine period if they were really concerned about um transmission of infection but you know right now given what we know about reinfection which is not a lot it would seem not to be a risk thank you that's super helpful um nestor have you had heard anything or know anything new about the ivermectin studies i saw a story from bangladesh it's the only one that i've seen that it showed no benefit but that's that's one one story and it was polish a few weeks ago and it was it was out of bangladesh and that much i remember i don't remember the details but i know it was a comparative trial and they couldn't find uh benefit from the iberomectin that's the only the only uh study that i have seen published they were using i think two micrograms per kilogram daily those thank you thank you very much and um kim joy up and espanola was asking if there's anything known about the vaccine that's being used in china about the effectiveness or anything about that vaccine how about which vaccine i'm sorry i didn't hear kim do you want to unmute yourself okay sure this kim joy from espanola no i was just reading in the paper that the chinese had started giving the vaccine out to their population and i wondered if we knew what vaccine it was and if that information once they start giving it to their population would do us any good as far as effectiveness and side effect information no i don't know the details of the of the of that chinese vaccine i know they approve it several months ago and they were going to use it in the in the army uh but that haven't seen anything after that initial communication and i think it was an adenovirus vaccine in china they have several they have a live uh i'm sorry they have an attenuated virus and they also have some of these newer platforms using adenovirus but i don't know really what what if they're going to publish or they're going to do some type of of comparison to see if we can use the the efficacy data out of china i don't really know thank you nestor um i don't think this one was answered lynn colemeyer had a question about the reinfections in addition to the mutation and the vaccine questions have the repeat covet infections been worse like been worse than the original infection that they had yeah in two of the three reports i had it has been worse the reno nevada case and the virginia case the hong kong case the second time around was asymptomatic so it's two to one so far of the three that i know we have to get more information but it's a very very small number but yeah the two subjects in in reno and he and in virginia both were more symptomatic they have more symptoms the second time around surprisingly enough only the one in hong kong was detected in the airport when he was coming from spain and it was completely asymptomatic thank you very much um we have gotten through a lot of the questions um let's see joanna do you see any that we have not have a ques i have a question yeah it's regarding the changes i mean with this mutation in the laboratory part have you seen any like changes or you you anticipate any changes on the diagnostic on the pcr uh have you you know have people talk about um because we have talked about the changes in in the protein the non-changes regarding the antigenicity but how about needing to change or modify the pcr have you heard anything about about that with the mutation or that hasn't been a concern so far we haven't seen any concerns on the laboratory side almost all of the assays are two target assays and that was in anticipation very early on that there may be changes in the virus so every single assay that we use detects two different distinct targets whether it's the open reading frame um the in or the spike or various targets so we would begin to see in some of our assays that one target is identified while another one has dropped off um and we see that sometimes with lower viral loads um and that's to be expected at some of the lower viral loads but if we started to see that discordance between the two targets at higher viral loads that's when we would be really concerned about potential mutations affecting the detection of the virus and the pcr tests thank you and any news on the saliva i there was a paper in the new england journal or or or like a letter it was a small correspondent letter uh and and these authors actually i'm going to bring it next week but they they show a higher um viral load in the saliva than the mp swap and it was patient collected so so i thought it was you know it was really good are we still moving in in that direction at some point i know you explained this to us several times that it's it's more complicated with the saliva but are we planning to move in that direction at least here in new mexico um we're making movements in that direction and just trying to identify one of the challenges with saliva that we've seen is that um you know saliva is not always saliva and so trying to identify through the studies what type how the saliva was collected and what type of pre um instructions pre-collection instructions were provided to the patient um for those validations so that we can get the best sample type but we are continuing to move forward and trying to identify the right patient populations for that sample type [Music] great thank you thanks nestor um a few more questions came in i'm wondering if i can um ask some of these to you and carissa and marla um uh viola um gennadio asks about uh the flu shot and i thought that might this might be a nice little discussion because uh it seems more important this year than ever and just wanted to get your thoughts on that i see marlip with a big smile so maybe she can tell us what they're doing at the doh to publicize it sure we've had uh we've been talking about this a lot lately and it's a message we're trying to put out from department of health that getting your flu shot um this year is you know even more important because um you know as we move into respiratory violence virus season every year you know we have deaths and hospitalizations related to flu we don't have a vaccine for covid yet but we do have one for flu and we can prevent a lot of hospitalization and illness uh by good vaccine coverage especially in congregate settings places like nursing homes uh you know corrections facilities group homes um you know where getting vaccination can really make a big difference in transmission in those close quarters settings and so we think it's really important that people are are vaccinated one of the things we've run up against already is people in those congregate settings work in those congregate settings say well you know i used to get a flu vaccine because it meant i didn't have to wear a mask for all of flu season but now that everybody's wearing a mask anyway why bother getting the flu vaccine so we're really trying to sort of counter that messaging and remind people that it'll be really important um to decrease fluid transmission to help preserve some of our health care resources um for you know an anticipated increase in coronavirus cases and maybe one thing i can add with flu is that there's many of the tests that are emerging are going to be able to detect both flu and coronavirus um and so and as multiplex tests so there's some new tests that are coming out that will be able to detect both of them and that goes hand in hand with some of the doh recommendations to test for both um coronavirus and influenza and then most of the respiratory panels that were larger that included all of the common coronaviruses and para influenza viruses and other things those are being updated by the manufacturers to include coronavirus on those panels so we should be able to cover testing for other respiratory viruses along with coronavirus during this season thanks marlo thanks carson what i've noticed at various pharmacies um where they used to have used to charge for the flu shot now they're offering it for free in many places too so they're making a big push um a few more questions here one i think that carla might be able to i mean uh marla um excuse me um i just lost it but while i'm looking for the question again um i want to let everybody know that the cme link went into the chat as well as the slides for dr sosa and and dr hayes is also in the chat from about 30 minutes after the hour and the cme link i just went in the chat a couple of minutes ago um also wanted to um cecilia died and asked the question if a patient has had a covet 19 has had cover 19 can they still get a flu shot do they have to wait a certain period of time before getting a flu shot if they've had coven 19. that's a great question i i i mean i i don't i don't know honestly i don't know i guess i would uh wait until the person is a favorable and and somewhat recover but but aside from that i i haven't seen anything published uh or or any specific recommendation i don't know if marla knows but i i think it's just common sense waiting for the acute infection to subside and then you can get the the vaccination yeah and that's what cdc um has said so far as well that as long as a person has you know met the criteria for discontinuation of isolation um then there's no reason to delay their influenza vaccine beyond that point mr thanks marla um another another question about maybe for marla is from kathy holland dr holland what accounts for the variability across states and cities um in terms of availability and delay for obtaining test results kind of a general question about uh testing and results yeah and i carissa please uh chime in i think um we talked a little bit about this last week part of it just has to do with where your tests go you know i think in some communities um tests are sent to um you know big regional reference laboratories like quest or lab core um and so you've got some transportation time for the specimen built in um and there have been you know a lot of news reports about the backlogs that those uh labs were experiencing and so i think if your testing is going to lab core and they're experiencing a two-week delay you know you're going to get caught up in that we're lucky in new mexico that most of our testing happens um here in our state uh with tri-corian with our state public health lab and so while there is you know some transport time for more rural areas of the state to get those specimens to albuquerque once they're there the turnaround time is very good 24 to 48 hours so i think we're fortunate that we've not experienced those 10 to 14 day turnaround time issues that other states have but i think it just is very much depending upon local and regional testing capacity that's really what drives that more than anything marissa would you like to add anything on that no i think that's um that's exactly that's exactly perfect um the the closer that the testing can be to the patient is always better and anytime the test has to go to a regional lab you may get caught up in testing delays because of bad blogs there and so i think that's that's probably the largest impact to the variability of turnaround times across different states um dan saltman has a question and wanting to know um epidemiological question has there been a recent tie in the rising cases in the midwest with uh gatherings or or some biker activities or for instance labor day um activities have we seen an uptick in in cases from labor day weekend either in new mexico or regionally well i can talk about sturgis i have seen i mean the first thing i heard it was in a in grand rounds in the in university of california in san francisco the and then there was a publication or a report out of the san diego also university in which in which they they uh apparently linked uh over 200 000 cases to this church's event 260 000 to be to be exact uh based on on a study done by the i have it here it's the um the name is the the center for health economics and policy study at san diego state university so they actually yes they they think uh from interviews that they did and calculations et cetera that there were more than 200 000 cases linked and and in part those uh the increasing cases in north dakota and south dakota and some of the other midway midwest states are probably linked to that event and to other obviously other reasons but but yes the answer is at least the analysis so far seemed to point in that direction there was some transmission and a significant number of cases i don't know if marla you have different information but that's what i have heard yeah i've seen i've seen the same they've been able to link a pretty uh surprisingly large number of cases and i think it was something like 46 of all the counties in the country were affected um by people who had attended that rally so that was yeah really interesting as well thank you guys so much um let me uh just um i think dan saltman you had if you're available to unmute could you ask your question i think uh about um oh dan solman asked about have there been any uptick in cases regarding actually labor day and political rallies and other types of events so there that was one of thank you thank you everybody and thank you joanna and and dr right i was so that that question i didn't mean to to belabor it too much but about political rallies of course and and the time the the spike the problem is is the timing that if the timing is is there's a delay in the exposure to when people are becoming are when the case case series rise up and so sturgis is a good example labor day is a good example you know and political rallies are good examples so i don't want to belabor that point but i did want to get my other little question in there which was about the the coveted sniffing dogs in i think in finland that was very provocative apparently they can detect them before they can detect covid before it shows up on the on the pcr test they were saying that's that's extraordinary so i was wondering what your thoughts were on that on that that ex that report you know whatever that was thanks dr salton thank you yeah i i really have nothing to add i mean i i read that that paper in people location and it was really interesting i mean they have been this similar uh words with cancer and other medical diagnosis trying to to teach dogs to smell uh some type of volatile gases that are uh you know particular to a disease so so but i but i haven't really seen any any anything else or read any other comments besides that i don't know if they they continue to be successful and and you know they're using it in any in any setting like airports or something around along those lines i haven't really read anything else but it's really definitely interesting you know that the using dogs for this for these and other diagnostics um methods i know if karissa wants to come in are they getting dogs in try core anytime soon just kidding back to you carla thank you joanna i think rosa had to sign off before she got that question so we just have a couple minutes left i just want to make a couple of announcements but thank you everyone so much for joining and thank thank you to our subject matter experts for being here it's really really great information um just as a reminder the cme link is still in the chat so if you would like cme and please do fill that out and give us feedback to make to help us with the clinic um if you're unable to get your question in today please come back and see us next week and i wanted just to remind everybody the critical care um echo cova tell echo is still going on um the next one is going to be this thursday october 1st from 8 to 9 with michelle harkins and she's going to talk about covid19 and asthma which is one of her her real specialties is asthma so that should be interesting and joanna do you want to talk about the the first responder sure the first responder resiliency echo is still um going strong it's every week from two to three pm mountain time so just in an hour from now and uh there's uh various uh didactics uh just like this uh followed by uh breakout uh sessions it's a very unique echo with psychiatrists psychologists emergency room physicians police officers law enforcement all frontline healthcare workers trying to work together to kind of come together to kind of fight this pandemic so thanks carla yeah and if for any additional information please visit our website the echo coven 19 website and see if there are other echo sessions that you're interested in and attending so thanks everyone and we'll see you next week you,,9/28/2020
22,okay can you see it full screen perfect okay today i have a few of the uh articles to discuss uh actually this was a presentation in the morbidity and mortality weekly report regarding the change in the ages distribution of cases in the united states especially during the summer and and as you all know um at the beginning of the of the epidemic were the first cases um the the group that was most affected were actually patients over the age of 60 especially the mortality was very prominent on on that group but more recently we have seen a shift in the in the groups um that are affected by kobe to the point that that the age 20 to 29 in this report um from from all over the united states was the most or the highest the one with the highest incidence more than 20 percent of the cases were in that in that decade of of life and the other important uh observation uh in these uh in this mnwr was that the authors observed that after a peak in the incidence among patients between 20 and 39 there was another peak in older in other age group over 60 um approximately eight days later so i range from four to fifteen so that was an interesting observation so despite the the the fact that the the median age of the patient affected have been going down after after the the younger group is affected we see a spike in certain locations in the older group and i'm going to show you a couple of the of the um graphs so so this this um this figure actually has the median age so these are the age of the of the of the patient that were tested or have positive result or had confirmed cases or where ed visit and you can see how the median age was going down or trending down all the way into the you know the end of june and then again some of these markers were actually the the median age started to increase and that's one one of the the observation that that although um the youth you know have less of complicated uh cases you cannot uh they can serve as a sort of a bridge to to infect older folks are probably at home and doing more um i'll be more careful with the epidemic and this this was really um evident in the hhs region six which include uh obviously our region new mexico oklahoma texas et cetera and you can see this is the age 20 to 39 and you can see the peak um was the 21st of june and then the older folks 60 and over the peak was slightly later so they pick actually after the peak of the young so the hypothesis is that that probably young people are infecting all people that are at home or in other different settings so an interesting i think an interesting report the other the other paper that i wanted to to highlight and i think i mentioned this during the last office office hour and actually we asked a question to uh carissa about this what's the the use of saliva and there's a a letter to the editor of the new england journal a brief publication on on a comparison or a short publication comparison of saliva versus mp swap um for the diagnosis of sarcobi2 and you can see well that they actually um the end of patients the number of patients that they saw there were 70 patients with with sars kobe 2 infection and you can see from the graph that all the way up to day 10 the the saliva samples were more sensitive there were a higher percentage of positivity um both in the first five days of symptoms and from six to ten uh so so um and also the the viral load the the quantification of the amount of virus was higher in the saliva than in the than in the mp swap and these salizo saliva samples were collected by the by the patients um as opposed to the mps that were collected by the by the physician so that was interesting and they found also less less variability on these on the values of the city from one day to the other in the story they actually did sort of a pilot analysis they also tested almost 500 hawker workers they found 13 positive but they had saliva and mp in in nine of them and as you can see uh nine were positive uh with saliva only two of those positives were positive by by mp so so it seems that that's alive it's more more sensitive than than the mp at least from this small report i think more more data is needed but it's a it's an interesting observation because obviously saliva is easier to collect um less invasive and and can be done by the patient um uh him or herself the other the other uh paper that i found interesting uh was the paper on the differences in the immune response we know that kids tend to have a milder disease they have a higher percentage of asymptomatic infection their mortality rate is is less than adults especially older also these authors actually did a very uh in-depth look at the immune response both antibody production cellular activation cytokine production in a group of children uh with malcolm with severe copies and with the multi-inflammatory syndrome and also they compare it to mild patients with myocardiate adult patients with myocardial or severe copy and and what they found and these are basically the conclusion of a very lengthy and complicated um you know those publications in science science are always very detailed but the the big picture is that um the kids the children had lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and higher levels of specifically of il-17 and interferon compared to arrows and i'll have stronger t-cell response and even higher levels of neutralizing antibodies so the the first conclusion and you can see here the the inverse correlation between interferon and il-17 and h so the the older you were the lower levels are interferon gamma and il17 io17 is a cytokine that is very important in the in the immune response and interferon gamma is thought to be produced by the innate uh immune response so it's it's uh you know one of the one of the conclusions of the study was that that definitely arrows um they do mount a response uh to the to the kobe 19 but probably that excessive response is associated with a with a more severe clinical course and and probably and this is basically speculation still but probably the explanation for for why the children do not mount such a high uh adaptive responses because they have a better innate or or stronger innate response with the interference production and limitation of the of the viral infection but so so i thought this was this this was interesting and you can see for instance the levels of neutralizing antibody adults in pink pediatric patients in blue it's higher uh from for models and in fact when you when you make a figure with the age and the area under the curve of the of the neutralizing antibody production there's a clear linear relationship the older you are the higher the neutralizing antibodies which are supposed to be beneficial but but they may may also be accompanied by other antibodies that increase the inflammatory reaction and make the disease worse so so i thought it was it was interesting so we are slowly sort of unraveling the differences between children and adults regarding kobe 19 which was was one of the questions that we used to ask at the beginning of this epidemic why do children have less of a severe disease and the other the other paper related to the same topic was a actually a meta-analysis or a systematic review meta-analysis um published on september 25th in which the authors review uh 32 studies that were relevant um they were mostly studies of contact tracing and they compare adults and children regarding the risk of being infected and they found that patients younger or subjects younger than 20 years had a 40 percent lower odds of secondary infection so they the um children do not only have less severe disease in general but they also have less susceptibility to infection according to these these um pretty extensive uh meta-analysis of the study published since the start of the of the pandemic and the the other and final final uh point that i want to review it's a bit more complicated but i think it's also interesting we have been been talking about this for for some time i don't know if you remember i presented a paper many weeks ago about a case of a young man who has severe carbon and they found and this was in the netherlands and they found this group of men had actually uh some uh inborn errors of the of the interference um metabolism or interfering production so they that was the first association because we know there are some clear risk factors for for kobe severity and there's a lot of inter-individual variability of kobe severity we know some of the risk factors like age male gender the underlying medical conditions but are there any genetic differences or or or um some other reasons that could explain at least some of the some of the severe coming and there were two very um important publications in in science recently one had to do with the with the interference again i'm gonna just mentioned in this in this uh graph for those who are not familiar with the with the interference they're usually when when when there's like a like a foreign uh molecule like rna viral rna there are these so-called cold-like receptors which are are really pattern recognition receptors they they recognize something that is not human or not um you know that could be a pathogen like like the lipoprotosaccharide in bacteria or rna or or viral dna and then they they activate a whole group of of enzymes within the cells and the end results in the production of the so-called type 1 interference which are actually natural antiviral products so they they are produced and they they activate the cells and they make themselves more resistant to infection with virus and also their production of inflammatory cytokines so it is logical to to assume that if there is a an inborn error in any of these tolerant receptors or some of the intermediate enzymes and you are not able to produce enough interference you can have a severe disease and that's in fact what has been proven with these two two papers they did a study of 659 kobe patients very severe patient they had a 14 mortality and they found that 3.5 which is extremely high had um an inborn arrow error of of the loci associated with tolerance sector three and one of the intermediate the r uh irf7 or interferon regulatory transformation factor so so at least um you know three point five percent of the patient who have severe copy can be associated with this immune inborn immune deficiencies or genetic immune deficiencies and these are some of these patients and the levels of interferon alpha and you can see that they didn't they didn't have any detectable interference as opposed to a a control patient that had very high levels or patients without this mutation have very high levels of antibody the other phenomenon and this was more common and was another paper was the presence of auto antibodies against interferon so so this this other group of patients were 987 patients a hundred and one of these severe kobe had these uh auto antibodies against interfere and obviously they had very uh very high levels of disorder antibodies and non-functional or or very low levels or interfering in the blood so so apparently from from from these two studies at least 14 so 10 plus 3.5 two plus three point five almost fourteen percent of a patient with severe copy can be explained by either lack of production or function of interferon or antibodies that they have produced auto antibodies that they that have been produced and attacked the interference so we're starts you know slowly unraveling this this story and these are many implications for therapy for screening and other things that i think that it's going to be developed in the in the future um and then just to finish a couple of of paper that i recommend reading one by gary topple from the scripps institute in uh in san diego about kobe and the hearts very nice illustration he mentions in this paper that there are two mechanisms of heart dysfunction one is directly by the infection of the of the myocytes with the virus and two because of the indirect damage from the inflammatory and cytokine very very interesting very uh you know readable review uh this this how the heart is damaged and i think i mentioned this last week but just to bring the illustration the annas of internal medicine publish a review on the transmission of sars and they actually go through all of the mechanisms possible of transmission and what evidence in favor of that is it's available and what is not that's it thank you let me stop sharing that was a mouthful no it was fantastic as usual nestor we're so grateful um i think we'll uh save questions till after um every after our hub team has had the chance to uh present and i think we'll turn right now to dr hayes hi leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine um that was really interesting i'm so glad you understand that because i don't understand that stuff very well at all so and i'm just had a four articles i wanted to mention the first is even really an article is just a report in medscape and uh brigham and women's hospital is experienced in outbreaking of cobit among patients and staff which i was actually kind of discouraged about because all of the stuff up until now has said there's been very very little health care outbreak in the last few months so i really felt like the ppe was making a difference we could do this safely but and i do think we can do it safely because it sounds like there were some lapses but so far they've had 30 employees and 12 patients test positive because of exposure within the hospital and they first detected it on september 22nd and it was initially a patient who was aerosol generating procedure and not masked obviously and what they found during their investigation was that many patients were not mastering clinical care and during interactions with staff so making sure patients are masked and then the eye protection they said both clinicians and other health care workers were inconsistently used to buy protection during patient encounters and also this is one i think is really important because i do see and hear about this a lot where people are really good about physical distancing and masking except during meals and then they sit right next to each other and they eat and they're unmasked and there's is definitely some concern that eating can cause definitely droplets and possibly aerosols so um i really like eating with other people and i understand the urge but i think we do need to make sure we are not eating next to other people um and then this was an interesting one out of thailand and it was a case control study and basically they took i think it's 1040 patients who had been exposed in three different locations to a patient with covid and they were asymptomatic contacts and they later tested um the cases were asymptomatic contacts who later tested positive for covid and the controls for asymptomatic contacts who never tested positive and what they did was they found three clusters one of which had started in a boxing arena one of which had started as a night club and the third which had started at a workplace actually for the state and i just thought this was kind of a cool graph and dr slides are always so much prettier than mine that i felt i had to include this so i could have at least one um a is the nightclub and the black one black dots are the um patients with covid who later ended up spreading the red dots are the people who turned positive and then these um little branches off are further clusters where they check to see if they caused other people to turn positive and the nightclub as you can see there were a few who turned positive the boxing arena if you'll notice is almost completely red they had a huge rate of um people uh um secondarily getting covered with a couple clusters outside that also had secondary infections and then the state enterprise again is just a few and so they looked particularly at what they defined as high-risk exposure and high-risk exposure was fined as people who lived in the same household had direct physical contact with the covid patient were less than one meter from a cova 19 patient for 15 minutes or they were in the same closed environment such as a room nightclub stadium or vehicle less than one meter for more than 15 minutes and so of the 1040 890 were considered high risk exposures and they looked at the secondary attack rate and i was amazed the boxing stadium was just huge 86 percent of the people in the boxing stadium and they think that's because people were right next to each other they weren't masked and they were yelling very loudly throughout this um nightclubs which i always thought was one of the most dangerous place was much less at only 18 although still quite high household was less than both of those so even living with somebody is not as dangerous as going to a nightclub or to um an indoor sporting event and then the workplace uh secondary attack rate was fairly low at around five percent and then what they found as far as factors contributing wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with a lower risk for a covet infection compared with not wearing a mask and they found that the type of mask worn was not independently associated with infection and it was just more always wearing masks sometimes wearing a mask didn't really help when i looked at the study to me it looked like the surgical masks were better but this is one of those times i'm a little resentful that i spent so much time learning histology and not very much time learning statistics they did some statistical stuff in the article and what they found was that people who wore surgical masks were better about the hand washing and the social distancing so that actually accounted for their um decreased infectivity rate and that masks in general just had a beneficial effect so and then the other thing was maintaining at least a meter distance from person with covid and not having close contact for um more than 15 minutes of frequent hand washing all were associated with lower risk for infection and then alcohol use all all indicators of social dysfunction are going up and alcohol use is certainly one of them frequency of alcohol use increased um that people are drinking an average of three-fourths a day over 30 days more so on average alcohol was consumed one day more per month by three or four adults and also an increase of heavy drinking and there was a increase of one day per month for roughly 20 percent of women had at least one day of heavy drinking over the month and there was also an increase in what is the short inventory of problem scale which is are you having problems from your alcohol use and basically there was an increase of alcohol related problems in regardless of how much people were drinking one in 10 women were having it so this is pretty significant so i think it's really important that we be asking people about alcohol it's really easy to get focused on covered risks and but we got to remember there's a lot of other things that are going bad at this time and then this last one um i was particularly interested in part because the second author is the husband of my former flute teacher but i'd seen headlines about this and my initial thought was somehow that little nasopharyngeal swab had actually punctured the skull and anyone who's gotten an np swab knows it certainly feels like they're puncturing the skull so i was very happy to find that was not what actually happened it was a woman in her 40s who presented unilateral rhinorrhea metallic taste headaches neck stiffness and photophobia she had had covid19 testing for an elective hernia repair she had had idiopathic intracranial hypertension and removal of nasal polyps 20 years before and they did a cat scan what they found was she had a 1.8 centimeter encephalocele that was bulging into her posterior nasal pharynx and um they think what happened when they did the swab was they just went right into that encephalocele and that's where the leak was and they were able to repair it and she did fine and so the articles that you really should consider alternative methods to nasal screening and we just learned how great saliva screening is but in patients with known prior school-based defects sinus or school-based surgery and or predisposing conditions and actually i um contacted dr schweije and his response asked what what he would recommend he said if there's a history of sinus surgery a known school-based effect or any condition like intra cranial hypertension predisposing to skull base defect he would recommend oropharyngeal or saliva sample if available don't do a middle turbinate swab and keep in mind the anatomy you want to go straight back and not up he said most of the pictures that he'd seen illustrating the article also the swabs going you know sort of up the nose and he said that's not how you want to do it you want it to go straight back and that was all i had thanks leslie so appreciate your time and same with nestor we know that this is taking a lot of time out of your a lot of pre-work and a lot of time in devotion so thank you both um i want to turn now to marla sivers i believe marla is on and has an announcement as well from the department of health hi good afternoon everyone marla sivers from the new mexico department of health epidemiology and response division dr sosa thank you for talking about the incidence of coba 19 and young adults because it was a perfect segue for what i wanted to share today if you go to our cbnmhealth.org website if you look at our data dashboard you'll see that in new mexico the highest number of cases are among adults age 20 to 29 and then the second age group is adults age 30 to 39 even though adults over age 65 are over represented in our mortality and hospitalization numbers and those tend to get most of the attention most of the cases are in younger adults um and not the older age group there are three new epidemiology reports that are available on our website these are going to be updated uh weekly every tuesday so if you go to the main cvnmhealth.org website up at the purple ribbon at the top there's a new option which says epidemiology reports and if you'll click on that there are three reports uh one for cases one for mortality and one for hospitalization and it goes into some detail that's not been available uh previously uh publicly on our website about cases broken down by age group rate ethnicity county etc so those are up on our website now they'll be updated every week with the newest information and we'll continue to refine those reports and include different variables you know as people have questions about the data that's available so take a look at those and we welcome your feedback thanks much marla as always we also wanted to introduce um cecilia thompson um cecilia is covering for uh carissa who couldn't be with us today and cecilia's a colleague of carissa's at tricor cecilia could you um introduce yourself sure like you said i'm a new medical director of infectious disease at tri-core and i'll be working with karissa colebroth i don't have any lab updates but i'm happy to take any questions thanks cecilia so much and then before we begin our regular kind of questions and answers um my colleague from the pain center my partner in crime and he works at project echo uh he's a filmmaker at heart in his other career he he wants to um talk to you about a special project that he's doing just for a minute or two um and we'll put his um email in the chat as well dr ben dates thanks thanks so much joanna um i i just like to take a minute or so to talk about excuse me a film project that we're working on i had made a documentary for pbs about project echo which aired last year before covet uh we're doing an update uh on this film ultimately uh to talk about echo's global covet response and we're going to be filming in africa and also here in new mexico and i'm looking for for practitioners who might have patients who have chronic coveted symptoms so-called long-haulers uh i'd like to focus on on on consequences of this epidemic and this pandemic and and i think um if we can find some stories of folks willing to talk about symptoms that they have following their acute case i'd really appreciate it um i don't need to do this in a clinical setting i realize they're stressed as they are i'd rather actually interview a patient in their home environment and possibly a practitioner in his or home his or her home environment and possibly a zoom call between patient and practitioner but anyway if if you have anybody that you think might be willing please contact me my email i think they're going to post it it's b dates b-d-a-i-t-z at salud.unm.edu thanks thanks ben and and yes elena martinez just posted just posted your name and email at 12 31 and wanted to let everybody also know um ben is a terrific filmmaker and writer and then finally that um the the copy of the project echo a democracy of knowledge is also on the chat as well and then finally a copy of the slides i believe elena is also posted um if i'm not mistaken it will be posted shortly but back to you carla thank you very much joanna yeah i think the copy of the slides already went in and thanks ben if if um if somebody thinks of a patient later on and they don't have ben's email you can just um email the generic covid um email and then we'll get it to ben so thank you very much all right before we get started with the questions i just wanted to mention um dr caro put into the chat something i'm super excited about and phil my my passion is viral hepatitis so i'm thrilled about the nobel prize but alan did you want to end um um yourself for a minute and just and just say what you said in the chat i know you're there i don't see you on my screen alan can you admit yourself sorry it takes a minute hi yeah hi it's dr alan caro i i'm fortunate as a blood banker to work peripherally with this um super quick harvey alter started the work on uh infectious hepatitis back in the 60s working with bloomberg to identify australia antigen for hepatitis b he persevered for 50 years and nih supported him for that period of time working ultimately towards the identification of non-a non-b hepatitis which ultimately proved to be hepatitis c uh also harvey alter at nih michael houghton working a brett working on the west coast at chiron corporation and then dr rice working at st louis uh university ultimately put it all together we now cure 95 of individuals found with hepatitis c it's one of the great points and the most important thing for us today is the technology created through this discovery is exactly the technology used to find sars cov2 within two weeks of its first recognition as a clinical syndrome it's made the difference thank you so much yeah thank you alan for for we're letting everyone know about that super exciting um there are a lot of questions about the presentations um but dan saltman did have a question nestor um about your one of your slices said does does that mean that screening for interferon deficiency and treatment with interferon for those who are identified as indicated yeah i think it's too soon but that's one of the comments that the authors made i mean they said that that uh if this is you know replicated and up to you know ten percent of the patient severe patients have these uh genetic markers i i yeah i can envision a future in which you can be uh screen if you have severe covet or or you're at risk of severe coping but it's probably still uh you know some way to to that they need to corroborate the this finding um just for for the sake of discussion the initial association between blood types and kobe has not been sustained i mean they have they have continued to look for association with severity and blood type and it hasn't been um corroborated in in other studies so i think we need to wait a little bit this is like the first uh report uh on these on these genetic markers but i think it's interesting thank you very much nestor a couple other questions um around pharmaceuticals and new treatments can you um give any update on the monoclonal antibody studies there's that question and then there's also just a question in particular about the whatever the monoclonal cocktail or the antibody cocktail that was given to the um to president trump yes that i know there are two i mean there are many many uh companies working on monochrome antibodies but there are two that are more advanced there's one monoclonal antibody by eli lilly who actually demonstrated a 1.7 less risk of hospitalization in patients they did a study and and then there's this regeneron which is a mix of two monoclonal antibodies which is the one that that uh it was com you know communicating the pressure was given to president trump and they are monoclonal antibodies directed against the spike protein um so it's it's sort of similar to the to the plasma or to the polyclonal immunoglobulin but these are are obviously engineer antibodies that have been produced um and they are from a single clone or b cell from a from a patient that that have recovered from koble but they're very active because they these companies usually screen hundreds of antibodies and they look for the most active most neutralized and that's the one that they they actually must produce so that's what i know the the regeneron um product uh still has not been published nor has has it been the eli lilly these are just press release by the by the company but they speak about amelioration of symptoms they speak about decreasing the viral loss significantly shorter with the with the monoclonal compared with placebo but still very preliminary not peer review not even pre-publication these are just reports to the to the to the stockholders or or press release from the companies about how their their product is doing i think we need to we need to wait and really evaluate this but it makes sense i mean it's like i call it the compalison plasma on steroids this is really a very uh select group of antibodies which are you know attached very nicely to the spike protein and thus should prevent the the virus from infecting cells so it should be given earlier we have demonstrated this with with convalescent plasma the earlier the better um and and hopefully even prophylactically in some in some cases but we have to wait we have to wait and see what the real publications show and and and you know what what um issues are with these monoclonal antibodies great thank you very much um another question a question from deborah mcgrugo in albuquerque can you please comment on the use of steroids in covet is it now considered standard of care and at what point yeah to be honest i i mean i i i even today review the nih guidelines one more time the indication for dexamethasone or corticosteroids it's really for patients who are requiring oxygen preferably those who are severely ill with with uh you know inflammatory markers with increased inflammatory markers this is not recommended for early disease for outpatient management and in fact the patients who were not on oxygen in the famous recovery trial did worse than those who receive uh than those who were in oxygen or were receiving mechanical ventilation so this is really for hospitalized complicated patients with inflammatory syndrome not early on in the disease not for ambulatory non oxygen requiring subjects that that's what the nih and it's very similar to rendezvous both both treatment are are mostly for for patients who already have oxygen requirement and are are hospitalized thank you very much i'm going to switch gears a little bit and ask um a couple of questions about testing well this may be maybe something that you can speak to um there's a question from sandra mull how does a nursing home report point-of-care lab results and what's the process once you have have done the point-of-care testing so right now the option for reporting those lab results are directly to the department of health and we have a fillable pdf that people can report individual results or a csv line list template that people can use to report if they've run multiple tests at a time and we have a secure portal that those can be sent back to the department of health as a method for reporting starting on october 15th nhsn is releasing a module for long-term care that will allow them to report their rapid tests so their antigen tests through the nhsn portal and that will go directly to cdc and be reported back through aims to the department of health so that will satisfy their reporting requirement both to department of health and to hhs for cleo laboratory reporting so that won't be up and running until october 15th and using nhsn does require that current users upgrade their security access to be able to report patient level data right now nursing homes are reporting aggregate data but not patient level so they do require a security upgrade to do that and they can contact nhsn directly to get that upgrade going but once they've got that up and running october 15th they won't need to do dual reporting anymore that will satisfy their reporting requirement but in the meantime we do have a way for long-term care facilities to get those results to us great thank you marla i'm gonna well i have you there i'm just gonna ask you one more question can you just can you talk about the best practices for contact tracing this is a question from dan saltman i don't know dan if you're on this came in as a pre-registration question but um i don't know if that's too big of a question marla yeah i mean i can give sort of an overview of what you know ideal content tracing would be um we could call those best practices i think you know you want to identify people who have close contact with the index case in the two days prior to their symptom onset or two days prior to their positive test date if they're asymptomatic and much of that work is done directly with the case for them to provide you a list of people that they may have been in contact with um obviously you know people's recall um you know people some people have better recall than others some people aren't able to provide contact information uh for people that they may have been in close contact with um if it's someone who is you know an acquaintance and not someone they may know well enough to have a phone number for but generally we ask people to provide us a list of people that they have ongoing contact with or had close contact and again in new mexico close contact is um determined by three minutes or more within six feet of a confirmed case and then best practice is that you're able to contact those uh folks who may have had an exposure you know within 24 hours of their exposure so that they can be you know rapidly identified given quarantine recommendations um and assisted with finding a location for testing so those are sort of best practices and what we do then is we follow those contacts once we have a list of contacts we touch base with them periodically through their 14-day incubation period to ask if they've developed symptoms so we do try to follow those contacts through that 14-day period again assist with testing if they need it and then provide them guidance about when they can be released from quarantine and go back to work people have challenges in quarantine such as location you know needing a letter to be excused from work or accessing other resources our case monitoring team can help with that as well during their quarantine period so i don't know if that answers dan's question right marla could i just ask if they're an essential worker what ppe should they have on for that so when they're in their quarantine period yes so i think you're referring to um so there's a couple things for healthcare workers um you know if people are wearing appropriate ppe using the cdc criteria for exposure while caring for a confirmed case then that's not considered an exposure so if a healthcare worker had eye protection and at least a procedure level mask and 95 if they were involved in an aerosol generating procedure we would not consider that health care worker exposed and they would be able to continue to work there have there are some exceptions for some essential workers who have a known exposure to be able to continue to work and depending on their you know their work setting you know again the very least would be uh universal masking so making sure that they're practicing source control uh physical distancing frequent hand washing and self-monitoring for signs or symptoms along with uh workplace monitoring thank you i appreciate it truly an expert in this field um nestor were you just waving at someone or did you have something to say no it was something i had a question for marla it was very similar to lazily for this for like regular folks non-healthcare workers let's say if if i'm called by the department of health that i had a contact with a person let's say my uh in the supermarket uh you know or something you know more sustained but i was wearing a mask um does that count as an exposure like a regular cloth mask does that count as an exposure to or are masked incorporated in this and i'm referring to non-healthcare settings so it wouldn't matter if the person exposed or the source were masked if you spent more than three minutes within six feet of that person we would consider it an exposure great thank you thank you so much marla um there's an interesting question from alana benjamin and taos can you please speak about any evidence that the flu vaccine is somehow partially protective for severe covid19 any thoughts or knowledge about that yeah no i don't have any specific specific uh data related to the to the copy i mean to the influenza vaccine i just can sort of repeat what we have discussed before that there is this hypothesis that if you especially if you use live virus vaccine like mmr or some other bacterial vaccine like like bcg you can uh sort of boost the innate immunity and and and thus be indirectly protected from severe copies but this hasn't really been proven still in prospective randomized trials so so it's just sort of a hypothesis or or or an explanation of a possibility based on what we know but there's really no proof and and and i i i know less about the influenza vaccine in this particular case because it's usually not uh except for the for the intranasal the usual one that we get in the arm is not a live virus or it's really a protein based uh so so it shouldn't be it shouldn't work the same way as as the other viral attenuated viral vaccines that presumably stimulate the innate immune system and can give you some protection but again there's nothing proven this is just um you know speculation or hypothesis that that immunologists have about these uh these vaccines and the way you work with the immune system great thank you so much um back to you joanna hey um this is uh thanks carla joanna katzman here this is a question from maria uh bruckner is is there any data on cardiac echotex or breakdown of higher risk hospital workers people i think that need to do procedures in close contact with patients who may or may not be coveted positive do you know about any studies marlo or nestor about any studies with increased risk of um you know getting coveted no i have nothing really specifically about echocardiogram echo technician i guess they have to i mean my recommendation would be to follow the the general rules that that are in the hospital regarding ppe's depending on where you are like we in the university of new mexico we have been changing rpps and be more liberal with the use of n95 so if you have a patient that that have clinical suspicion or is a pui a person of uh interest and you're waiting for a test and you know you you have to wear a 95 at the beginning of the epidemic because of the shortage with the n95 we were more conservative and we were accepting the surgical or procedure mass for those non aerosol generating procedures but now we are a little bit more liberal and if you if you really consider the patient uh you know suspicious for for kobe because they have cough fever or an infiltrate and they're waiting for a test result uh you can wear an n95 uh if we have enough uh supply in the hospital and that's been a recent relatively recent change at unm thanks thank you nestor um there's a couple questions about vaccines both in the chat and in pre-reg um one in the chat says from phil hertzman have there um been any results reported regarding large-scale vaccinations such as those done in russia or china no i haven't seen any publications on the results on that we only have the so far the phase one and two for most of the vaccines um i heard that modernize uh presenting some of the preliminary data to the authorities really soon maybe end of october but i haven't seen anything published about the the different vaccines that are that are installed in china and and the one from from russia thank you nestor and then um dan saltman is wondering about um his question is do you think what do you think about giving any new vaccines to minority or other uh or disadvantaged populations first and i'm not really sure dan do you want to unmute yeah that was just in the news that there was uh that a federal agency i didn't read it very closely but they were suggesting that that be the way that they'd be the priority groups and that's got a it's kind of a double-edged sort of problem that yes if it's an untested vaccine you're going to first roll it out among the most disadvantaged people you might be finding what the problems are as you go with that in that population so i was wondering what your thought it was a but it was a a federal recommend you know there was a panel that recommended that was recommending that as they had set out the priorities did anyone else see that i can find it if i in the paper and the stack of papers over here right mr marla leslie have you have you seen a similar thing i what i've seen is that there's been a lot of interest in first rolling it out to health care workers and the elderly first so i think the jury's still out but i'm not i haven't seen what you've seen dan nestor actually i saw on one of my facebook groups the healthcare workers say that she was not eligible for one of the vaccine trials because she was not high she wasn't doing enough high-risk stuff she was wearing ppe at work and no other exposures and they wanted people who might actually be exposed for the trial so i thought that was kind of interesting this is marla and i know what's trying to be assessed right now there's a survey that went out to hospitals and other health care providers in new mexico that have staff who might be prioritized for vaccine distribution is to really try to stratify for hospitals to try to stratify their staff into people who might have ongoing high-risk exposures um you know versus people who weren't really um at risk for exposures people who were in administrative roles or non-direct patient care roles and they really wanted to kind of tease out how many people might be you know respiratory therapists or working in icu or other specialties that do a lot of aerosol generating procedures and really trying to um kind of create a tier of people that they felt might be most at risk and could benefit from vaccine the most thanks marla i know that the national academy of medicine has created a committee and is is looking very rigorously at kind of the ethics of distribution processes dr sullivan so this is a national academies of sciences engineering and medicine i made a report a panel recommendation and they as expected they recommended health care workers and first responders get first priority uh they should provide it free for all the panel said and throughout the vaccine campaign efforts should also focus on disadvantaged areas to remedy racial racial health disparities this was a national academy of science engineering and medicine report that just came out that dan and i think kent our digital librarian just put um some information about that in the chat wanted to remind everybody that the cme link went in the chat at about 46 minutes after the hour as well um uh elaine strothers from las cruces um is interested in um kind of what's going what's happening with new mexico schools and criteria that would make opening the quote opening of schools safe and i'm wondering if marla might be able to um you know provide some insight perhaps into what's happening with perhaps the new mexico public education do you have any insights there marla um yeah i can share that you know in the last public health order counties that were designated um quote unquote as green based upon the new mexico criteria we're allowed to resume a hybrid model of some remote learning and in-person learning how that looks in each school has largely been left up to individual school districts to decide what works best in their communities so we do have some schools like albuquerque public schools that have said they won't resume any in-person learning until after the first of the year and others who have adopted a hybrid model as long as a county right now is meeting that gating criteria meaning uh fewer than um five percent of their tests are positive and they have fewer than five cases per hundred thousand over the previous 14 days those counties are eligible to resume in-person learning though some school districts have opted not to do that ped is doing a lot of work right now with individual school districts um to help come up with some criteria about if school was open you know what would trigger a closing again even if you were in a green county you know how many positive cases in a school um you know clustered among a certain grade or widespread kind of trying to think through if school was open and if you had positive cases what would the threshold be for closing that school again so a lot of work is being done with the public education department some people here in eppie um you know and a group of superintendents and other people who really represent the school as stakeholders and trying to come up with some universal criteria that schools can use for making those decisions thank you marla so much and there's a couple other excuse me carlo back to you a little prematurely thank you joanna okay um let's see we just have a couple more minutes left we got a lot of questions pre pre-registration questions and thank you for all the great questions in the chat um is can nestor maybe you can speak to this has there been any any more information since we met last about reinfections anymore reported reinfections or any any more yes yeah i think the reports of infection keep coming the last one i saw in the pre-publication stage of two asymptomatic healthcare workers in india both of them tested at the beginning of the year march and then again august september and they both infections were essentially asymptomatic so so it was interesting because they were testing these helper workers frequently and they found some genetic difference between the virus they got the first time and the second time and i saw a press report this is not an article that the count was around 16 cases of reinfection that have been documented some of them you know in a pretty detailed way and you're 100 sure that they look like reinfections others less stringent criteria but at least it's not just two cases now we're up to the last time i saw the count was around 16 cases so it's becoming more more frequent but still you know even if it's 20 it's 20 against 30 million so it's still an infrequent event but but uh as i've said many times and not surprising because all the coronavirus are classically associated with re-infection so so i wouldn't be surprised i think the most the most critical question is is this going to impact the vaccination is this going to happen after vaccination that's an uh an important thing and is it going to affect herd immunity really so we have to wait and see more more of those reports and these cases of reinfection have been both in some cases miles the second episode is milder and in other cases have been more severe so it's not like like all the second cases are are are mild or all the second cases are more severe it's a it's a mixed bag of of you know asymptomatic mildly symptomatic and even more symptomatic cases like the one in virginia and the one in nevada so very interesting but we keep you know piling those those reports and hopefully somebody will analyze them in groups at some point or or report a large group thank you thank you very much nestor um a couple of really quick questions um cecilia i want to use your expertise there's one question about um is there any information about the rapid gargle test which i haven't heard of and then what is the name of the saliva test and where is it being used if you have go ahead um i don't know the gargle test i have heard of it but i don't know any details about it the saliva tests there are i apologize i missed the beginning of dr sosa's talk on saliva but there are a few labs that have received either eua status or a validated saliva we have not at tri-core saliva is a much more complex specimen type than a np swab or even a throat swab an op swab and we find that we get a lot more invalid samples that way it's just a little bit more complex so tricor's not performing the test on saliva and as far as i know labs like um lab core and quest might be but the turnaround time for those labs is going to be you know um a lot longer up to a week or more great thank you so much so thank you everyone i think we or just we just have a couple of minutes left and i wanted to um make a couple of announcements thank you very much to all of our hub our hub team for their expertise and their time very super helpful and and very informative um if you were unable to get your question answered because there were quite a few that didn't get answered please come back next week and we'll try to answer them at that point um the cme leak is in the chat as we mentioned a couple of times we have a couple of other uh echo covid related echo clinics here in new mexico there's a first responder resiliency echo that's on mondays from two to three and the topic and the presenter today is community resiliency model by um linda grab grab grabby and elaine miller carrass and we're putting the link um carla the link to that echo is in the chat now excellent thank you very much and then we have our critical care still going on it's only twice per month the next one is next as october 15th next week um the topic is to be determined and any there's a lot more information on the our coven 19 website so please check that out if you're interested and thank you so much for joining and we hope to see you next week have a good week,,10/5/2020
23,uh thing like i did last week so it's going to be pretty pretty mostly clinical and epidemiological i think we have a lot of things to cover but these are some of the main publications so the first thing uh was the data published in the new england journal about the modern vaccine in older patients as you know influenza and other vaccines are known as influenza vaccines and other vaccines are usually not that affected in all their groups so it's important to to take a look at how the new vaccines that we are developing against kobe 19 works in older folks so so this this publication by moderna was was welcome uh they actually look at the data for patients 56 and 70 and also over 71 and and they they were testing the two doses in their protocols at 25 microgram and 100 microgram and i can tell you right right off the bat that they're gonna use probably the all the the higher dose for elderly um patients so the 100 microgram dose and we're going to show some of the results so this is the the basically the protocol they have four groups 10 in each group 10 patients in the group this is an early early study 20 in that group of 56 to 70 and 20 in the more than 71 and they were pretty balanced regarding gender and ethnicity but mostly mostly where actually white so not too many minorities represented in the study which is an issue with some of these vaccine trials the adverse event um it's something that we're used to see the first vaccination which is the the column on the left doesn't produce that much in the way of of adverse events some local uh expected local discomfort but the second dose is definitely much more reactogenic and this is across the board younger and older people but it's it's also present in the elderly so it's important and i think all of the vaccines that we have seen um are associated with significant reactorgenicity which is bad for the patient but it's good if you take it into the if you interpret this as an immunologic reaction to the vaccine so it's not an inert uh material it's actually something that that you get some low grade fever fatigue um soreness in the area of injection and hopefully this will correlate with immune response um and and talking about immune response the one of the most important markers are the neutralizing antibodies and this we have the two 25 doses in the 50 to 70 more than 71 the 100 milligram and you can see that the basically the levels of neutralizing antibodies especially the high dose the 100 milligram produces the same levels of antibody as younger patient this is the column of 18 to 55 from the previous published study so you can see that the levels of of antibodies and these neutralizing antibodies was very similar uh when you use the 100 microgram in uh in in any age essentially 56 to 70 and 71 so that was good news that this vaccine seems to be immunogenic even in uh in older uh in older patients using this ffrnt which is one of the assays when you use with the real virus pr and t you can see there's a slight decrease in the neutralizing antibody between the younger group 56 to 70 and more than 71 but still pretty decent levels um which are comparable with uh with what we see in the younger population so so that's that's the good news about this modern vaccine that it seems to be immunogenic for elderly folks and the same thing happens with the t cell respond the cellular immunity definitely the low dose didn't mount almost any response this is the t cd4 th1 response but you can see that there is an important cell mediated immunity response in the higher dose for both group 56 to 70 and more than 71 so though so these results are the ones that indicate that we're going to probably use um the high dose or the high dose will be used by moderna especially for elderly patients and no no th2 which is the the the one that we don't want the type of response that may be associated with pulmonary inflammation it's basically not present with any of the doses in any of the age group so that was also good news um and and there was a one publication on hydroxychloroquine i think the only the only area that is still somewhat debatable uh for hydroxychloroquine is is we can use it as pre-exposure prophylaxis as you know it's been uh discarded as a treatment for moderate mild and severe copy but there's still some some investigator which we think that if you use it early enough it may have an effect but this this uh double blind placebo randomized study of hydroxychloroquine in actually healthcare workers um they were taking this hydroxychloroquine before they they uh were exposed to to kobe and when they look at those that were taken and not taking the hydroxychloroquine no difference so it's another another negative study for for hydroxychloroquine in this case as pre-exposure prophylaxis and we have already post-exposure prophylaxis and as i said treatment so hydroxychloroquine um so far no no good news from from that um molecule that was actually pushed at the beginning of the of the pandemic as a possible treatment based on the in-vitro story in vero cells but there's definitely no no clinical efficacy in this clinical trial um another another topic that we have been discussing is the the long covet and i found this recent paper um published in in clinical microbiology and infection it's actually a pretty well done study on follow-up of patients with non-critical copy because as you know there has been the discussion that some of these long-covered symptoms are maybe related to the fact that the patient is in icu intubated immobile so they when they leave the hospital they're weak they still have some lung issues they have a lot of fatigue and and people have speculated that that this may be partly just due to the you know the critical phase of the disease so these authors actually look at the non-critical copied patients and they follow them for 60 days and they did like uh standardized questionnaires on these patients and and registered the the symptomatology and they actually um initially enrolled 293 um patients they ended up because basic some patients were not not included uh 101 with mild to moderate coverage and 29 with severe copy but non-critical non-icu copied and the results what it was what we suspected that a high very high percentage of patient on day 30 and day 60 uh almost almost two to third of the patients uh they have persistent symptoms uh so so more than one or more symptoms in in basically two thirds and this persisted all the way out to the 60-day follow-up so it's a pretty pretty um you know prevalent um issue some of the most frequent symptoms was the the loss of sense of smell and taste the anos mia and agusa um we have um at the onset 59 had it on day 30 28 and day 60 still like one quarter of the patient had this um this anosmia or or lots of sense of of taste also um astania which was not reported in the initial um information was 50 in day 30 and 40 day sixty and this now you can see that thirty six percent on day thirty and thirty percent so so a lot of these symptoms seems to persist beyond day thirty um and all the way to two months after they they left the hospital the other interesting finding of this trial was to to see if there were factors associated with symptom persistent and they found first the younger age group a relatively younger age group 40 to 60 were more likely to have these symptoms if the patient was hospitalized obviously and if there were there was uh evidence of abnormal pulmonary auscultation which are all markers of severe disease so the more severe disease the higher the likelihood and the age group was kind of interesting it was not the older or the younger but actually like like the middle of the of the group and this is this is sort of the same result um graphically so to the right was the odds ratio of having persistent symptoms so if you receive oxygen if you have a normal excludation if you are hospitalized which is essentially in my view the same thing uh you had a higher or odds ratio higher out ratio of having symptoms and if you were in this age from 40 to 60 also was to the right of the curve so a higher probability of having symptoms so though you know this is more information regarding the long coverage which i found interesting this this was the 30 and the 60 very similar results uh the other important trial that was published uh over the last week was the final report of the rendezvous and i'm gonna i'm not gonna go over the you know all the graph and things um the result of this final report was very similar to the original uh bigger publication the preliminary report um so the the end of the story is that that rendezvous shortened the recovery a patient who received rendezvous across the board and this story had 10 days they recover as opposed to 15 days the placebo arm so a five-day reduction in the recovery which gives you a rate of recovery um of 30 more 1.29 basically and these are the confidence interval and this was statistically significant unfortunately um the mortality the kaplan-major mortality report at day 15 and day 29 there was a numerically better survival with rendezvous 6.7 versus 11.9 at day 15 11.4 versus 15 and the placebo arm but both of these um differences were not statistically significant so because the hazard ratio across one barely cursed one so i mean but but you can see that definitely the mortality was was less in the rendezvous but um it was not statistically significant and this was a pretty large trial a thousand you know more than a thousand patients so so that was the the final report of industry um you know a positive finding but not not what we expected especially no impact in mortality at least in this trial and again patients with that were receiving oxygen but not in ecmo or mechanical ventilation where the those who benefit the most was the larger group and was also the the group that received more benefit those who were really at the beginning of the disease or not requiring oxygen no no significant changes and those at the end of the spectrum also had less of an impact so so the drug should be used presumably early but in both patients that require oxygen that was the sort of the the conclusion of the of this final report and i'm not going to go into this i'm going to skip the graph for the sake of time but it we discussed that in when the original publication and finally one a couple of epidemiological um publication first of all this was interesting um interesting publication in the mmwr uh from arizona and i think i think the results are really um compelling of of how you can actually flatten the curve if you implement some changes and not necessarily complete lockdown which is one of the things that is being discussed and so this is the the the number of daily cases in arizona and you can see after they lifted the stay at home and the summer came you can see how dramatic was the increase in cases in in in our neighboring state arizona but then they slowly um started to implement measures they limited public events closer bars gms movie theaters something similar to what we have done here they also mandated the use of mask and enforce the use of mask and you can see how dramatic the decrease in the number of cases occur at the end of the summer so it was a very steep very high but then when when all these measures that are here listed here were implemented you can see the the decrease in the cases so it is possible to actually flatten significantly the curve with the with with public health measures so that that i think that's good news for for us and finally the the cdc uh again um placed the the transmission by airborne in in in their webpage which it was removed originally um it was placed for like a day or so or hours and then it was removed then they edited and then they finally uh made made up a final statement on this that that can sometimes be spread by airborne transmission and in how it's it spreads in the cdc webpage i think that's the that's the last one thank you okay you wanna thank you yeah um very interesting there um thanks thanks nestor always so i learned so much so quickly with with your powerpoints uh thank you so much and i wanted to introduce dr leslie hayes leslie has a powerpoint as well so leslie and we're going to take questions as you have questions from dr uh solstice powerpoint please put them in the chat anytime and we will get to them after um after we introduce our hub team members so leslie hayes hang on i'm struggling to get this up one second take your time i thought i might have to have words with dr sosa when he presented a slideshow that showed um or a study that showed 56 to 70 as elderly but you redeemed yourself when you called 40 to 60 young with the next study so ah boy i don't know why this is just not popping up for me here oh hang on elena do you have it because i just i can't get it to come up today i don't know why what's going on here so yes i do okay oh wait found it got it can you do this can you see it can you guys see my slides or no yes we can yes okay great yes okay first um one i was going to present i thought this was a pretty cool article it's from jama and it was on the science of persuasion how you can um i guess there's actually been a lot of studies on how do you persuade people to do things and they offered some lessons for covenant team prevention so they talked about the five habit promoting strategies which if you want somebody to develop a habit be it exercising or eating more vegetables or wearing a mask they said there's five things to do you want to make it easy to start and easy to repeat you want to make it rewarding to repeat you want to tie the behavior to an existing habit and i know i do this with people all the time suggesting they take pills when they brush that and talk about behaviors that conflict with existing habits and provide alternative behaviors and provide specific descriptions of desired behaviors and they discussed for um the first one of making the behavior easy to start and repeat making hand washing stations and hand sanitizer available everywhere really makes a difference on how often people wash their hands and you know it it's obvious but often we don't have hand sanitizer readily available so making it readily available then they talk about leaving masks right next to the front door so they're easy to grab as you leave the house and then i've certainly seen this most places i go in public anymore where they have marks on the floor demonstrating six feet apart and that just makes it so easy to stay six feet from other people they also talked about communication and clear consistent messaging and they said this is actually most important at the local level and i feel like we've gotten pretty good messaging clear consistent messaging on a state level which made me feel good about it one thing they talked about behavior and the media has really been guilty about this so many pictures of uh people on the beaches or um at sturgis or wherever not doing what they're supposed to because when you highlight the bad behavior it makes people think it's more prevalent than it actually is and so it tends to make people less willing to actually do what you want them to do so you really want to be highlighting people doing what they're supposed to and then the other one that unfortunately the medical field did a really bad job at initially is conceding uncertainty for medical people you know we just said there was no evidence for wearing it in public and i still to this day have people posting on facebook that you know dr fauci or the surgeon general said not to wear masks and you know it's from back in march but people absolutely believe that message from back in march so rather than saying you know this is what is true we want to say based on what we know today sort of conceived we still don't know we're still learning lessons about this and then scientific american um published something this week cobit is actually the third leading cause of death in the u.s for this year it became the third leading cause of death march 4th and it was actually the first leading cause of death from april 5th to may 3rd and it's been the third leading cause of death for the rest of the year and then indirect effects on children in new york state this one was actually really quite heartbreaking um the united hospital fund found that 4 200 children in new york had lost a parent to covet 19 this year about 950 were children of single parents and so they lost their only parent um uh it was one in a thousand children in new york state lost a parent to cope at 19. um one in 600 black children one in 700 hispanic children and one of fifteen hundred white children um 57 were in queens brooklyn or the bronx which were the hardest hit areas so it was really that was fairly heartbreaking and then they also found that 325 000 children were pushed into poverty or near poverty in new york which was roughly eight percent of children in new york who had not been in poverty before covet 19 started were now in poverty and they estimated it was going to cost anywhere from 550 to 800 million just to support the basic needs of these children in households that were newly newly in or near poverty over the next year and they estimate that 40 of low-income workers lost their jobs throughout the united states and those of course are the people who are the least able to absorb a financial hit like that and i decided not to go into this this is fairly similar to the one i presented from minnesota department of health last week but there was a coven 19 response tool kit from the public public elementary schools on how to deal with children who are symptomatic or have a positive covet in their family or an exposure and then also updating from the american academy of pediatrics on covet 19 testing guidance and like i said they're fairly similar to what we've already talked about but it was nice to have something from local and the last was just some articles that i thought were really good i didn't um necessarily think it was worth summarizing but i thought they were worth either reading yourself or passing along to that difficult uncle on facebook um covet 19 myth busting by robin i don't know how to pronounce it shown thaler i think she posts a lot on facebook she's worth following on facebook just for her posts but she wrote an article for medium on the various myths around covet and this was quite good um ucsf had a grand round on october 6th um and they discussed president trump's cover 19 diagnosis and just sort of what it meant from a medical standpoint what you could tell what um what um we know about the medications that we used to treat them it's available on youtube and then um actually um the grand rounds was an hour and a half i didn't have time to watch it but julie thompson md is on facebook and she summarized it on her personal facebook page she's from oakland there's multiple julie thompson's but um her summary was really excellent and i think it's worth looking at if you're on facebook and then emily oster schools aren't super spreaders from the atlantic i'm still waiting to see definitive medical articles on this but this was quite a good summary and then elizabeth ralph here's how the pandemic finally ends was also an article that was definitely worth reading and that was everything i had thank you thank you so much leslie it is uh so great to get your take on what's important out there in the ambulatory world uh it's it's really great to get both both these uh both yours and nestor's um inputs i i'd like to introduce uh marla sivers just to say hi marla does not have a um any update today but if marla if you can just say hello so everyone knows who you are real quick marilyn hi everyone senior epidemiologist at the department of health thanks marla and then clarissa culbreth um can you just let everybody know who you are from tricor tricor scientist hi um i'm one of the medical directors for infectious disease diagnostics here at tricore and also my colleague dr cecilia thompson is also here on the call today thank you so much carissa and then my colleague at project echo carla thornton is one of the senior associate directors carla um are you here thanks jana yeah i'm here hi everyone good afternoon carla thornton here with infectious diseases at unm great carla um carla do you want to start with some questions yeah thank you joanna there quite a few questions in the chat um to start with dr seibel had a question and those with prolonged symptoms does that correlate with prolonged viral shedding and infectivity i think nestor from your initial yeah no i haven't seen that correlation uh i know that severe patient who has severe acute coping meaning patients who are in the icu or hospitalized they tend to have a longer vital vital shedding than those who have mild or asymptomatic disease but i i haven't seen the correlation between lung cobaid i mean vision will recover and and viral shedding and i think that's that's one of the questions if if this is a viral phenomenon or an immune phenomenon and we still don't know i know they're looking into that actively they're they're having like this cohort of patients in which they're doing immunological studies to see what type of immune reaction they have they're trying to look for the virus in different tissues to see if there's any persistent in the cns or somewhere else but i haven't seen anything published yet thank you nestor um i think marlo this is probably for you because there's there are a few pre-registration questions and then there's one in the chat about you know at least in new mexico this large increase in number of cases that that we've seen in the last couple of weeks if there's um at least what you guys are thinking about with the explanation of that increases you know right now we think that there is multiple factors we kind of had many things change all at the same time so we had the long labor day holiday and we know from our case interviews that there were a lot of people who traveled um had people from out of state travel to visit them lots of family get-togethers and at the same time you know that very same weekend we liberalized um indoor dining indoor dining was open again um the number of people that you were allowed to have in an indoor space um increased things were you know looking good heading into that weekend um you know some schools returned um to in-person learning and um there were multiple other kind of recreational activities that were given the green light to open back up so you suddenly had this long holiday weekend where you had travel you had family get-togethers um events and you also had people spending more time in you know indoor spaces like restaurants breweries bars um skating rinks pumpkin patches and you know sort of etc there were a lot of things that were kind of given the green light at the same time and so we think it's really a cumulative effect of all of those things not any one thing but people definitely have reported uh increasing group activities and travel including dining thank you marla um there's a there was another question just about whether or how much you can how much you can explain by the increase in testing has do you think that the increase in testing has added to the numbers significantly or not you know the testing numbers right now really are sort of back up to where we had been through the spring and early part of the summer we had a drop-off in testing uh you know kind of late july and august but where we are now it's kind of where we had been um through the late spring and early summer so there's not been a significant increase in testing throughout the state thank you very much a couple other questions um claudia guzman said if covid19 is airborne then we'd have to improve the ventilation in many or most places to create negative pressure how is this being addressed nestor do you have any ideas no i mean i can comment on what the at least the hypothetical or or scientific data says you know ideally yeah if you're going to be in a closed space uh the ideally that that room should have negative pressure but obviously that's not feasible in most you know stores you know supermarkets etc so you know have to go to to have good ventilation if possible to establish like an air current uh in some places opening the windows and the doors if it's possible with the weather uh that that should help um also conducting activities outdoors as opposed to indoor and we've been doing that with restaurants and other things um with like curbside pickups et cetera so you know everything helps a little bit i think it's a it's a matter of improving and if you're going to be in a close place uh hopefully there won't be that many people decreasing the chances of running into somebody would call it so so no crowding in indoor spaces is also critical so there i think there are many many factors i wanted to add something to the comment before omar we are seeing the the number of patients in the hospital that also pick up so i agree it's not just a testing thing it's definitely real i mean we're starting to see patients in the icu today i have consented a couple of patients in the in the act 2 trial which is you know we usually get once a week we have three or four today um between dr uh harkins and i so so we're seeing the numbers go up and the hospitalization well definitely uh it's not it's not our imagination thank you nestor and barbara oakland just put in the chat what about people who are working in patient care in clinics where there's you can't open the window there's no you know there's no clear way to do that it's a big question my clinic is actually going to get an environmental engineer to come in and see how we can improve ventilation so that is i mean it's not cheap but um that is one possible suggestion is environmental engineers can come in and sort of evaluate for that right exactly improving i mean increasing the air exchanges in the room helps obviously and that's what we do uh in in the hospital if you cannot if you cannot actually open the windows then then having a more efficient um system that will will uh you know get free uh or or fresh air and and and frequent uh exchanges it's helpful as opposed to having a completely recirculated area in a closed environment yeah thank you and there's actually one more related question maybe it's answered jeff miller asked any thoughts on data on whether hepa air filters may help in outpatient settings and exam rooms and things like that this is marla um the epa did put out sort of a statement with some guidance about using indoor hepa filters and portable air filtration systems in enclosed environments um as to augment really kind of bringing in fresh air and that if you're not able to bring in fresh air um that this would sort of be uh better than nothing so they do have some information about use of hepa filters indoors but really you know they say it's to augment fresh air and many of the other engineering and administrative measures you have in place for protection i think you know that's one thing that's important to remember is there's no sort of one thing that is going to protect everyone from covet transmission it's really looking at you know the different um situations and the different indoor environments and trying to layer on that protection as much as possible so you know people who are masked um if you're in a healthcare setting wearing appropriate ppe increasing air exchanges bringing in fresh air if you can using portable filtration if you can screening people before they come into a space for signs and symptoms you know good hand washing good surface disinfection so you're kind of trying to layer on all of these uh measures to you know create some protection in those environments but you know unfortunately there's really no one thing which is going to protect everyone all the time or is really available to everyone in different settings thank you marla um there's a question jan blanchard can you unmute yourself a question that you put into the chat if not i can ask it for you i don't i do not see her on video um jan blanchard asked a question she wanted to clarify but what she thinks dr schrace said last thursday last thursday that young people less than 30 if their chief complaint is primarily a nausea without uri symptoms do you go ahead and obtain a covet test can anyone speak to that maybe marla you can i don't know i didn't hear exactly what doctors grace uh said during that meeting but anyone who has symptoms we would encourage them to be tested we've certainly talked to young people and um a lot of younger people who say you know their own they thought it was allergies right so they had some very mild maybe nasal congestion no other symptoms really and then when they did get tested were positive so i think someone has symptoms um you know even some of the more unusual symptoms like gi symptoms without another explanation um they should be tested yeah thank you i think that's what her real question was it sounds like people just had nausea alone that whether or not they should be tested but it sounds like um pretty much anybody should be tested with any sort of symptoms at this point uh so back to you joanna thanks carla um just wanted to um uh see maybe if dr mccabe melvina mccabe is on the call if she maybe wants to ask her question about the cdc and kids and face masks yes uh hello everyone hi the cdc guideline says children less than two should not be wearing face masks some pediatricians are saying children less than five should not be wearing face masks i'm just wondering what do we what do we how do we guide our clients on this mr cecily hayes i'm just going to comment that i have seen a lot of two to five year olds in clinic recently and not one has had trouble wearing that face mask correctly so um it definitely can be done i don't know if i wasn't setting like a daycare how easy it would be to keep it on all day but i will tell you for a medical setting it has not been an issue at all excuse me thanks dr hayes nester or marla any thoughts on that no i i i don't have any anything i mean i have a eight-year-old at home and she wears the mask but i know when she's in school she sometimes just put it below the nose and i have to try to to tell her not to do that but it's like you know eight years old it's hard okay thank you and and dr mccabe you had another question i'll just read it um because it relates to the airborne issues that we were talking about before um and your question is about uv light um and is that another option if i'm thinking uh if if you're indoors um might that be another option dr sosa have you seen any studies i i think uh i i read a jet blue i think one of the airlines is using kind of uv light as one of the ways to perhaps um uh you know clean the airplane or do something right i mean i've seen this mostly on press release and and and things uh mostly on on the press like people using these uh robots with the uv lights in airports and large areas where the you know in in at the moment where there's no clients around they they actually have done this but i i haven't really seen that much i mean i remember at the beginning of the of the epidemic we had to use uv lights or or hydrogen peroxide to to clean our mask or n95 or sterilize our n95 so yeah so uv light can be used in in both uh areas or you know areas where people are congregate after people have left obviously because of the risk of of skin damage and radiation damage and and also for for um objects you know like masks and surfaces etc um and we use it all the times in the labs to kill bacteria and other viruses so yeah but i i mean i that's that's as far as i can as i can see thank you nestor um and just talking about kind of the n95 um couple questions on on n95 mask uh dan saltman says should we be using more in n95 mass and less surgical mass in the health care settings and i'm thinking dan you're getting it as the uptick of cases go up or just in general dan if you want to maybe unmute and kind of further elucidate your question that would be great yeah that i think thank you thank you joanna that was in follow-up to the idea that it's uh airborne you know if it's airborne and it's persisting and we're protecting healthcare workers maybe those surgical masts are not adequate this is follow-up to the you know the closed room the closed rooms and the clinics where you can't really you can't really fix the ventilation very easily in a big building something like that thanks dan nestor what are your thoughts on that it's a tough question i mean we here at unm and i can give you the our real life experience at the beginning we we were not able to to uh use n95s on everybody so we were limiting n95 to like very high risk situations patients who you were going to perform like a aerosol generating procedure but at that time it wasn't there was that much science saying that it was actually airborne all the time now more recently that we are a little bit better with the n95 uh existence or or the number of i95 we are using n95 every time we contact or we're going to do care for a patient with kobe or a high suspicion of copy the patient that we're waiting for our results because uh you know he had a close contact or something so yeah so we're using more n95 uh obviously my concern and this is my personal opinion is that if we use too much uh when if we have another high peak we're gonna run into trouble again with the n95 so it's sort of a if a diff difficult decision so and then the other thing is that the evidence showed that if if you um you know if you have adequate ventilation in the room the the the the procedure micro the surgical mask converts decent protection we have seen uh data from other hospitals um that have published their the the percentage of of healthcare workers that are infected and interestingly enough the percentage is relatively low very similar to the community even in the height of the epidemic and i'm talking about studies done in boston and new york um during the spring so so obviously although theoretically a surgical mask is not enough in the practical sense if you uh as marla was saying if you layer that you know with adequate ventilation negative pressure room um taking you know using the face shield in front of the of the surgical mask limiting your contact with the patient to you know whatever is really necessary and not going in and out of the room many times during the day um all of those measures increase the the the incidence and and and protect the healthcare workers but obviously yeah if you're gonna go into a room and you're gonna do a physical or something and you you suspect the patient has a coffee i would recommend the n95 based on what we know now from from you know different stories thanks nestor um and naomi kisston asked does the hospital have enough n95s for staff and i think your answer would be possibly now but not if we keep using it every day for all the staff is that right but yeah i don't know how many we have but i know we're using it just for covet patience or suspicion of copy patient but not for the regular you know ankle sprain that comes into the eddy in that case we just wear you know the regular procedure mask and and we do question the patient goes you know if he has a fever cough shortness of breath etc you know we're not using it all the time because yeah we would run out of in 95 in a few days if we use it in all in all patient contacts in all situations thanks nestor um this is leslie i just wanted to add that um we worry a lot about the interactions with patients and we need to remember also that we need to protect ourselves with our co-workers because that's actually a substantial source of health care spread so um when we're talking about it make sure we're using protection surgical mask or something when we're around co-workers as well yeah exactly let me reiterate that yeah yeah and some some studies show that most most of the healthcare workers are infected by other workers in the cafeteria when they remove the mask to eat to talk you know in the break rooms more than with patient contact interestingly enough so so it is something to to remember all the time that yeah co-workers especially when we remove our ppe and start talking or shouting it's when when you really are at risk excellent points thank you thank you leslie thank you nestor um dr sosa dr tempus wanted to know if you're impressed with the australian lab study that found cova 19 virus can remain viable on glass and and money uh for 28 days right i have to read the paper i just saw the headline i saw the headline uh 28 29 days um you know they they uh it's sort of different to the one before that they talk more more about several days uh so yeah it's interesting i have to read and you know in order to give give my my opinion but i think that the practical message is the same i mean you have to assume that it's going to be in a surface that you have to clean a surface if there have been a patient there wash your hands as much as you can i think the take-home message but i i'll i'll be back to for this question next week when i look at the data of that paper specifically but i think you know it's not going to change our behavior that much it's just that we need to be careful with this virus if i don't think we need to to say that this say this in this group but i i think that's that's the take-home message thank you nestor and i'm wondering if jeannie boyle is available can jamie can we unmute you genie um well if you if you want to be a muted please go write it genie yeah hi it's joanna here i think that is you so good to hear you um do you want to um mention about nursing facilities using uv light yeah i'm i'm currently in houston working with uh harris county which you know has had a tremendous um problem with trying to contain the covid19 spread in our very large metropolitan area and so i go on behalf of the county into nursing facilities detention centers homeless centers and group homes to mitigate outbreaks and several of the very well functioning low infection of nursing facilities have been using um a room uv light of some sort when they do terminal cleaning so when somebody moves from one one part of the facility to another they vacate their room and as part of the terminal cleaning at the end of it um the uv light is placed in the room for a period of time i don't know how long it is if it's overnight or exactly how long but um you know just by looking at the the evidence um just sort of subjectively or objectively um there's it's really quite remarkable that those particular nursing facilities that are employing that type of device really have a low incidence of spread and low incidence of outbreak wow well thanks genie that that's incredible we need to look into that more that's really impressive so good to hear your voice yeah see you too back back to you carla thanks joanna i wanted to um ask dan saltman again to um mute himself again and dan had a couple of questions that didn't make it onto our pre-reg pre-registration questions dan do you want to mute yourself thank you uh thank you uh so one of them was a kind of more narrow question that was about the uh it's about the presidential treatment um he got would you expect that that when you when somebody receives monoclonal antibodies as a treatment for covid that that would uh uh confer any long-term immunity uh and stimulate the the cellular immunity and long-term immunity so that was one one part of that question and the second part was um just any comments on uh how one would judge the president's infectivity as in regards to cove that this is well i want to take it right on okay so the first yeah the monoclonals i have read and this is mostly press release and and other comments there are a couple of basic science papers with the monoclonal the half-life of the monoclonal is a few weeks so yes once you get an injection of monoclonal antibodies it will circulate for for some time um so so it's going to confer some at least neutralizing antibodies or antibodies against the spike protein if this monoclonal is erected against this pipe protein for some time they don't go away in a couple of days like like a regular drug they actually linger for for a while um in one of the papers that i read i remember you know seeing four weeks or one month of half-life so you you'll have some some protection i don't know what's going to happen to the immune respond to the uh his own immune response if if you uh if you blunt the with with monochromal antibodies i you know i don't know i have to to wait and see the large phase three trials with monoclonal and how the immune response if we still produce antibodies uh to the virus or or this is somehow somehow blunted and also see the the cell immunity if it's gonna be blunted by this passive immunity but i don't know i i would just be uh speculating and and regarding um the second question was about the treatment of the president uh about his uh about assessing the infectivity after he got he got really potent kind of treatment so that so that he he may not have mounted much of a a a cellular immunity response at all that was one ver one side of that because because he had an antiviral and he got antibodies and he got steroids so it blunted his own his own native response as well and that so then the follow-up on that was how would you uh you know in light of that kind of treatment how would you assess his infectivity his you know his uh his ability to pass on the virus right okay yeah so i mean we don't know for sure but uh the best test would be to try to find uh buyers that is culturable or viable in his respiratory uh secretion so that would be the ideal situation that's not something easy to do but you would have to do uh not just a pcr because the pcr as we have said many times in this uh forum it's it could be positive uh for for some weeks um so you would have to to really do some sensitive there are two ways to do that one is to measure genomic rna which is sort of a uh not just a regular rna but something that that indicates that there's active virus supplication and the other thing is to try to culture the virus if you're not able to do that or you don't find um subgenomic rna you you can safely assume that he's not infectious if we go just by the rules of the of the cdc after 10 days of his initial diagnosis granted that he's a federal you have to assume that he's not excreting virus but the only way to to be sure is by doing that and there are a couple of yeah issues that that as you alluded number one is dexamethasone dexamethasone um or corticosteroids in general tend to prolong viral chatting so so that's that's something against the president that in theory because he got the dexamethasone he may not be able to to um to to have a you know reduction of the of the viral shedding that soon um the second is the the what we know epidemiological and i mentioned this that if a patient has severe kobe they would have longer viral shedding so if he really had severe covet and was hospitalized that he was and we assume that it's similar to the regular population that is hospitalized with severe copy he may have a more prolonged uh shedding and in fact in that situation the cec talks about 20 days um as opposed to 10 days that that you have to consider the personal infection just for the sake of of of greater safety so so you know it's hard to tell in reality but if they did some genomic uh rna or they did a pcr and it was negative and viral culture and it's negative you can you can safely assume that it's probably not not infectious and on top of that he received the monoclonal which should protect him from from having a lot of viral replication um so that's thank you thank you very much nestor um i'm not sure this should go to maybe marla there are a couple of questions about whether it makes sense anymore to take the temperature of everybody who's going into a clinic or a restaurant or whether that's been shown to actually prevent um infection i think is the question i don't know marla from a public health standpoint if you if you think that that is something that should continue yeah i think it's similar um to what i said earlier about you're trying to sort of layer on um some protections many people who are infected don't ever develop a fever um i've seen some um numbers that say more than 50 percent of people never develop a fever um especially if they're in that early symptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase they're not going to have a fever um so you're not going to catch everybody by taking their temperature but you might catch a couple of people so i think you're really trying to you know through the questions about exposure and symptoms and taking a temperature again trying to sort of catch as many people as you can before they enter the space probably just temperature checks alone are not going to be very effective you really need to be asking the questions about symptoms and known exposures to confirmed cases and i i think there's also a behavioral thing i mean when you when you see somebody taking your temperature and asking you questions make you think twice you know about your symptoms other if you have nothing you go into a building you know like free we have seen i mean in some of the cases that we have investigated people have been symptomatic and they go to work and you know if you don't stop it and ask him they're like yeah well now that you ask me yeah yeah i have a little bit of you know aches and pains and i had a fever last night but not today so that that's the type of situation that we we face in reality with with this uh patient that had that then later later our our detective would call it so i think it's important it's a it's a behavioral thing that that puts a stop on the door and make people think about their symptoms and remind them that we are in the midst of a pandemic this is leslie i just want to get the other question i would love to see people start asking that i don't think people are asking is have you been tested for covid in the last few days because the last month i've had like five people call me and say i need a covet test because i just met with someone and they came in and said they were fine and then we found out they'd had a covet test yesterday they came back positive today so i think asking have you had a coveted test um is something else to consider asking as people come in the door thank you leslie that thank you that's really helpful um i just wanted to remind everybody that the the cme link just went into the chat about 12 45 and i think she repeated it so please fill that out if you would like to see me and you have any feedback for us um and also the slide sets from both um nestor and leslie's slides went into the chat as well so you can have a link to the pdf of those slides i'm not sure i'm sure you answered this um nestor but leslie hayes was asking are you going to be more or less likely to develop your own antibodies if you get monoclonal antibody as a treatment well i i don't know i don't know for sure i mean in theory it could be less if you actually let's assume you blunt the infection completely with the monoclonal you're really successful you may not uh no matter induce a natural immune response if if if um if the monoclonal in reality i don't think it's that you know a hundred percent you always have buyers and you would have to give it really early uh you know that so but yeah in theory it should hamper the immune response but i haven't seen any hard data so we have to we have to really wait but it it would um and the other thing is that it can give you a false positive igg so if you measure igg uh you you're measuring maybe the levels of antibodies against the the proteins i mean the spike protein so that's another thing so so i think we need to study and see what type of immune reaction the patient that are given monoclonal the same as those who are given vaccine what type of immune reaction they have and we'll have it we'll have that information because that's one of the things that they're looking in the phase three of both progenerone and and eli lily and also astrosenica which are the three most advanced monoclonal companies right now along those lines is there any recommendations when we do get a vaccine if somebody has received the monoclonal antibody do you need to wait a couple months before giving the vaccine that i don't know you don't like to get them together because you may blunt the the effect of the vaccine also but i haven't seen any data but we use it with other vaccines you don't want to use immunoglobulin um you know very close to the vaccine if you can if you can avoid it and especially if you're going to do it both you and if it's intramuscular you have to give it a different place so it doesn't neutralize each other no problem okay um there's one that this is a really hard question but i'm just going to say anyway because we don't really well i don't think we know but there's a question from claudia guzman coven 19 is transmitted via fomite droplet and airborne is it known which is the number one way the people are getting it do we do we know do we know the answer to that question maybe marla you can also chime in yeah the main way it's spread is still thought to be via respiratory droplets so person to person um you know obviously there is an opportunity for foam mite transmission but we don't think that's the primary way that it spread um you know and when cdc released this statement about aerosol transmission they were very careful to say this doesn't appear to be the same kind of aerosol transmission that we see with tb or measles or varicella it's more of a limited aerosol transmission so it's still thought that droplet that close person-to-person droplet spread is the primary way that the infection is being transmitted thank you marla back to you joanna great um i'm just i'm wondering clarissa and cecilia i'm wondering if you have any comments related to any of the these testing questions or anything else we just have a couple minutes left and you've uh wanted to see if you'd like to add anything to today's session uh no i don't have anything to add happy to have a quiet testing day um maybe just the one thing is that there is not currently any fda approved or eua authorized tests for the subgenomic rna that nestor was mentioning although there are some that are in various processes of development and submission so that may come to light at some point in the near future or let's not say near future some point in the future um but for now uh we rely on the cdc guidance for how to determine when to remove isolation thank you great thank you so much carissa we really appreciate your presence here um just wanted to let everybody know we have about a minute left um we still have the weekly first responder resiliency echo um that's on mondays at two o'clock mountain time um and so if you need information maybe kent you could put in the information about the first responder resiliency echo um if if kent our digital librarian can't get that momentarily it's always on our project echo website and then the first and third i think it's the first and third thursdays from eight to nine mountain time we're still having the critical care echo with dr michelle harkins it's not this week but it will be next week carla is that correct um i think it's this week isn't it let's see i don't think um i think it's 7 30. it's on the 15th yeah and actually it's going to be um donna upson is going to be talking about cobia 19 and um and it's in i think i can't remember i don't know elena if you have the title of her talk it's copin 19 and air pollution and air pollution okay fantastic so it seems like it's going to be kind of the intersection between climate change and covent 19. so it should be really interesting well thank you everybody for participating another great session and we'll see you next week,,10/20/2020
24,great fantastic uh welcome everybody it's october 26 i'm joanna katzman and this is our infectious disease office hours um many of you are in new mexico and many of you are in many states all over the u.s and some are even from uh farther away than that um wanted to inch i'm again i'm a neurologist i'm at project echo and i'm also at the unm pain center wanted to introduce my colleague carla thornton carla do you want to unmute and introduce yourself sure thanks joanna hi everyone carla thornton infectious diseases faculty at unm great thanks thanks carla just a few housekeeping items before i introduce dr nester sosa our kind of leader of this program and our other hub facilitators if you have a if you're not um if you don't have a camera we understand that please perhaps come on next week where you have a webcam but if you have the ability to turn on your camera right now please do so it allows for better kind of bi-directional teaching we can see you and you can see us and it it allows for more community of practice the other thing is we we do have a digital librarian today it's not kent noseworthy it's jackie jones who will be putting in evidence-guided evidence-based material into the chat that you can just copy and paste the information that you desire into your own browser and then lastly at about 45 minutes after the hour you will be getting information in the in the chat about a cme link that you can acquire your no cost cme and if you don't need that please feel free to still fill out that form as we do really look at this information very carefully i'd like to turn it over to dr nester sosa he's the division chief of id at the unm hospital and he's really led this program weekly since the end of march i think we're about 32 weeks into this infectious disease office hours for the covet 19 pandemic and then after that i'll introduce our other hub team members nestor thank you thank you very much joanna and carla let me share the screen okay can you guys see my screen excellent good okay so before i go into the papers i really want to um you know make everybody think um you know how the number of cases are going up in the state of new mexico and in the u.s and i think we have to double our efforts you know spread the word about the you know the different method there's no really room for coffee fatigue it's i mean it's it's really i know it's difficult we are all tired uh but the numbers are really going up not only cases but also hospitalizations across the the state so i think it's important to to double our effort and do it rapidly before it becomes really uh during a geometric increase in the number of cases and then we have to go to uh emergency measures in the hospitals and those sort of things so i think it's important to to to continue the effort that you have done for so many weeks and now more than ever because we're seeing a large number of cases everywhere not just here not just in the united states but everywhere okay so i'm going to go into into some of the papers that that actually uh interesting papers that i saw and um there is a and i want to mention this give some some light to another antiviral that we haven't really used or considered much uh in the west but it's been used and study in in japan and it was actually approved in russia for use uh against kobi and and i i and i uh asked the question it's five peer review the next round distribute there was a study on on animals showing the potential for for these uh antiviral which is it's similar in in it's in its mechanism to rendezvous but it's oral and and it can decrease the the the buyer load and and hopefully we'll will have some place and there are some large trial coming up in the near future with randessa so this story was actually in animals and i'm gonna you know bear with me i just want to show a couple of ideas with this this experiment so this this was done in mice i'm sorry in hamsters and and the good news is that we have now um a good model animal model in small mammals we we have been using um non-human primates and and ferrets uh but but this uh syrian master model is pretty good to test new drugs um and also to do all sorts of biological story so the way they did here they they actually uh pre-treated the the hamsters with this favipiravir and and and actually they use also hydroxychloroquine and then they expose the the hamsters to to an infectious uh dose of of sarskoby ii and then they follow them for several days the ct scan of the chest cultures of lung pcr the lung and other tissues and the interesting result is was with fabi pyramid which are basically the first four colors here gray yellow orange and and red and they show the higher the dose of favipira with the smaller the amount of virus in the lungs so you show sort of a dosed effect and these those a thousand milligram per kilogram are doses that according to the authors can be achieving humans so so at least this drug in in uh in animal models so to be effective and the other thing that i think it's just another nail in the coffin of the hydroxychloroquine they also gave these um hamsters hydrocycloid and you can see that it's you know the viral loads are very much similar to the control um hamster so there's no no effect of hydroxychloroquine uh and this is basically prophylaxis the other nice experiment which i think it's really creative they actually um pre-treated a group of of hamsters with the drug and infected a second group and then they put them to live together so this is like you know to see if there is any um pre-exposure prophylaxis and then they sacrifice these these hamsters and actually compare if those who were taking the fabira we were protected and in fact they were and i'm going to just go the one in the this is again the viral load of the of the infected and non-infected but treated uh mice the one with the circle and you can see that the orange the anti-orange circle which is a pre-treated um uh hamsters otherwise you say mice but it hamsters uh these pre-treated hamsters were actually protected uh or had lower uh rna pcr in their uh secretions compared with uh with with the untreated uh or with those treated with hydroxychloroquine so this drug was not only uh you know as as a pre-exposure prophylaxis but also prevent natural infection um so so it's it's interesting the the data from these fabira but we have to waive obviously for the human studies but this is something that is coming down the pipe we are going to start uh here at unm a slowly with a similar molecule called mk4482 it still doesn't have a name uh but we're going to use it early on and see if it's uh if it has antiviral effects in humans it's going to be a phase 2 study and i think it's going to start in in a week maybe maybe two at the most the other uh study that i wanted to mention there is a review for those who have asked questions about the you know the how long does the rna shedding last how long do uh patients actually uh excrete uh viable virus there was this nice review um it's gonna be published in infection control and hospital epidemiology i think it's a pre-publication or or an accepted manuscript in which they review 77 studies and basically all of the studies that have been published with good data on on rna setting and viral culture um impatient there were actually 12 studies with good quality data on viral culture and and you know they added all these and data analysis and their conclusion was that the the rna shedding goes on for um an average of 18.4 days so so you know more or less three weeks around rounding up but there were some patients in these uh 77 studies a few that had a long period of rna shedding and you can see the record was 92 days so uh it's really really uh you know slightly more than three months of of rna setting in these uh in these studies basically in respiratory secretion they also look at biosetting in stools and other tissue and they found that they you can you can find rna in some of these studies um up to 55 days with the the median duration 22 days so very not very dissimilar to respiratory excretion so that's also important and that's what we're using the so-called wastewater uh epidemiology because you you can you can use um the the excretion of the rna in the in the stools and then going into the into the sewage water as a measure or detection of these viruses and then viral viable virus or culturable virus or infectious virus if you want it's much less than than rna and then the range is between minus six days so six days before symptoms and and 20 days so so the the longest excretion really uh in the majority of the patient did not go over 20 days and obviously 20 days was for those with severe disease and that's why the the the cdc has that that the recommendation that if you have severe disease you have to isolate for 20 days if you have mild disease for 10 days because really viable virus is excreted relatively for a relatively short period of time in fact uh rna was uh up to 45 days longer than than actual viral setting and a similar phenomenon occur with with uh viral shedding in the school so this is an interesting paper for those who want to really uh look at like sort of a summary it's not really a systematic review or a summary review of the papers that have been published about viral shedding i found it very very useful and easy to read another another paper that i liked was an effort to to classify collee you know we have been talking about prolonged with long covey um and it's sort of there's sort of a disorganized uh number of names so so these authors actually they publish in the open uh journal of the of the of ibsa um the open forum for infectious disease and they propose actually three um classifications very easy acute copy which is what we know the patient in the hospital uh those first three weeks and they go all the way to three weeks from the time of infection to the coping obviously in an icu patient that could go on a little bit longer but then after the patient recovers from acute copy they call it post post acute copy 19 and then and that's from three weeks basically to three months and anything beyond three months it's a so-called chronic copy they propose this classification and i'll show you graphically what they what they propose so they have the acute uh copy their acute sars kobe infection and remember there's a nih classification of asymptomatic those who have no symptoms mild those who have no oxygen requirement moderate those require oxygen but they have more than 94 percent o2 saturation and at sea level and then severe when it's less than 94 and critical when they require um you know ventilatory support uh or or non-invasive ventilation so that that's the nih for the acute and then they call anything beyond three weeks or beyond hospital discharge for those critical patients it's called post-acute kobe um and they actually classify within this post-acute copy the multi-inflammatory syndrome in children and then those patients they mentioned they have persistent syndrome symptoms and persistent organs function and that's what we need to study what are the the symptoms that really are frequent what are the organ dysfunction and that's what we have been reviewing and then if you go beyond 12 weeks or three months then you you call whatever symptoms you have chronic kobe 19 because it's beyond this period of of between three and 12 weeks and that that's what they're proposing in the open forum of infectious infectious disease and um and this is basically the way they they say with the organ dysfunction the most common organ dysfunction in this post-acute copy that pulmonary cardiac thromboembolic neurologic and renal obviously that's the majority there are a few other organs that are affected but these are the more most frequently affected organs and then the symptoms and they reduce several of the publications that we have seen and we have even reviewed some of them here are fatigue respiratory symptoms like disney or cough artifacts sleep disorder concentration and memory loss obviously you can have both you can have obviously you can have pulmonary dysfunction by objective uh data like dlc2 co or or or pulmonary function test and you can have cough and disney so it's not one thing exclude the other there's they're actually together in this post copy but i think i i think it's a good way to see it as objective organ dysfunction or just subjective uh symptoms and these are the most common in their in their review so i'll give you just a brief update on therapeutics um the the trial that came out and i think came out as a pre-publication but it was commented by many people and i think there was somebody in the audience i forgot exactly who was the person but asked a question about this solid solidarity to try this is a trial that was organized by the wa show and it's sort of a real life trial they conducted many uh countries and they actually um asked them to collect data on the treatment uh different treatment for kobe 19 since the beginning of the of the pandemic so they they actually tested uh several treatment they ended up having 405 hospitals across the world 30 different countries more than 11 000 adults in raw and obviously they were they tested rendezvous calitra or lopina beer interferon um and and some patients did not receive any specific drugs and those were sort of the control but they didn't use a placebo and this was not a rock double blind um study it was mostly like as i said as a real life comparison of different treatments across many many countries many hospitals and in fact the wa show didn't pay for the trial so it was done with the own resources so there's some variability between the treatment receiving in a country let's say in in latin america compared to a hospital in europe so so that gives the you know some limitation to the conclusion but but the message um the message is that none of these drugs render severe hydroxychloroquine lopinabe or interference change the mortality or progression of disease in this study and actually you can see that the rr the relative risk are very close to one 0.95 nine t one point zero one point sixteen so no no effect of none of these drugs and dystopian you can see the kaplan mayor uh you know very close the control group to the to the treatment group in the different different arms and you can make an argument that hydroxychloroquine and interferon were actually worse than the than the control although not statistically significant um and regarding reductivity or something that made a little bit of noise in the u.s was that in fact for ventilated patients actually rendezvous was numerically inferior to the controller again the the p was not significant so no difference between render severe and and the control but again this story is not as good as the bigger story that was published in the new england journal because of the methodology there are some limitations to these uh to this trial but but nevertheless it's more information there uh available for for uh for us to to to judge on the effectiveness of these drugs or efficacy of this israel there was also there were actually two negative trials on toscilisumab one a randomized control trial published in the new england journal uh just to remind everybody those elisa mavis an ielts uh sex inhibitor and the thought because at the beginning of the epidemic we were really concerned about this cytokine storm and il-6 was sort of the center of the cytokine cytokines in this cytokine storm the idea was that we could use an il-6 inhibitor that was already available and used for other diseases sort of repurposed to use in um in kobe 19 and this is the the first large relatively large trial they actually evaluated 1500 patients but they ended up enrolling 161 in the in the arm of those illicium 81 received placebo uh almost in a two to one uh ratio and you can see the kaplan major survival this is ventilation mechanical ventilation of death and you can see that you cannot really separate one line to the other no effect of toscilisumab and there was another publication also with no impact immortality in german internal medicine about the same the same drug so at least we have two relatively large uh well-designed well-executed uh clinical trials showing no benefit from tosinizuma there are still some other trials but but at least it's obvious that it's not a miracle drug um by by any means and this is these are the discontinuation of oxygen and other parameters and again you can see that the curves are very very close both the placebo and the tosilisumab are very very similar and and finally this is sort of basic science stuff but i just want to share this um because we have been throwing these comments in and especially now that we're going to be seeing the efficacy and safety of vaccines they have been historically two mechanisms in which a vaccine can actually make the disease worse and i wanted to show a nice um graph that explains these two mechanisms one of the mechanisms the so-called antibody dependent enhancement so antibodies to to to a previous infection uh making the disease instead of better worse and the other one is a phenomenon that was seen with rsb um we formally inactivated rsv vaccines in children many years ago and it's called the vaccine-associated enhanced disease and i'm going to try to explain it very simply so this is um so this is the antibody dependent enhancement and how could this happen how could an antibody that is supposed to protect us enhance the disease and this is the mechanism so first of all this is the macrophage here and this is a virus and these have been described mostly with dengue virus but it has also been seen with some coronaviruses now with surge cop2 with some other coronavirus and and the story goes that you know you produce antibodies that are not neutralizing they don't kill the virus they don't destroy the virus and the macrophages have receptor for this portion the so-called fc portion of the antibodies so actually these receptors actually capture the virus and help the virus go into the cells because they are not destroyed they go into the cells and then they multiply within the cells so actually the fact that the the virus is coated with non-neutralizing antibodies um makes it easier for the virus to find a cell to enter and infect the cells even without using the typical or classical spike protein h2 receptor so that that's the mechanism in which scientists think that these enhancements occur and this occurs with dengue because dengue has four serotypes so if you get infected with one serotype you develop this non-neutralized antibody that do attach to others serotypes and and help the virus actually infect cells and that's why the second episode of then if you have the one and then you're infected with dengue two the second episode is most severe so this is one of the concerns that people have that in theory this could happen either with natural infection or with vaccines and something that obviously scientists are are looking into and finally the other mechanism is the vaccine-associated enhancement and and in this case what what what happens is if you use and this was the case of rsv respiratory syncto virus that was inactivated with formalin there was a change in the fusion protein which is sort of the spike protein of the rsv an antibodies attached to this dead or or inactivated virus and was deposited in the lung so there was sort of an immune complex deposition of these dead virus with the with the antibodies with the inactivated antibodies and then the immune system specifically the t cells recognize this this deposition of immune complex complexes and then produce an inflammation of the lungs so it was actually the kids who got the vaccine some of them um got really worse with the vaccine that with natural infection because of this activation and that's why we are looking for these type of reactions so the vaccine the th2 reactions with the vaccine that have been tested because this reaction immune complex is mediated by th2 with the release of some cytokines that actually produce inflammation so those two i know it's completely interesting to understand and this is what the data safety monitoring more and and the scientists that are looking into the safety of vaccine are are also looking not just the usual you know pain in the side of infection fever but actually a more a worrisome immunological phenomenon that could that could make a vaccine worse than the than the or the solution like the vaccine worse than the than the pronounce but this hasn't has not been described so far with any of the vaccines or with the sars kobe 2 so we we are optimistic that this is not going to happen but i i just wanted to give you the the sort of in-depth understanding of this phenomenon recommended reading for this uh politically charged environment there were two nice comments one in uh called the the false promise of hurricane immunity that i invite people to to read and this is a photo from franza orbasa um i'm sorry no salvador manaus in brazil manaus had a um an infection rate or or very high over 60 percent of the population of that town in the amazon or brazil uh became infected and they have to open mass graves and that's the risk of her immunity and that's what this paper in nature actually talk about and other it's sort of a um a comment on the courage in the climate of fear how um you know her health care workers have really faced this epidemic with valor with really courage um and and and how we expect from from people who actually are in empowered to also to also be uh courageous and take the measures necessary to to curtail the epidemic too nice nice uh reading that i recommend that's it thank you sorry that i took a little bit long time dr sosa no problem where it was all it's always amazing we learned so much every time yeah as fred was saying thank you thank you um it's so much great information i can ask you a ton of questions but i'm going to move on to introduce marla seavers our amazing senior epidemiologist from the department of health i think marla has um some introduction some updates for us tomorrow thanks joanna uh good afternoon everyone just one uh brief update i wanted to bring everyone's attention in case you missed the um press release last week but uh flu season has officially begun in new mexico we have confirmed um our first flu cases in new mexico so in addition to being on the lookout for people with clinical signs and symptoms of covid which we've you know been focused on for months now we are now back officially in flu season um it remains to be seen um how severe of a flu season will we will have um hopefully it will not be very severe and there won't be much flu transmission given um that the masking and the social distancing that everyone should be practicing um for covid prevention should help prevent influenza and other respiratory viruses as well but just wanted to make sure that clinicians were aware that we are seeing flu activity in the state now there is a weekly flu report that is published on our website um so you can check back there weekly it is updated every friday where you can see all of the national and statewide trends for influenza tracking in new mexico and so we track confirmed cases through laboratory reporting we also do syndromic surveillance for influenza like illness and all that information is up there on the website um along with some information about the different methodologies um to track um you know syndromic cases ili surveillance and um laboratory confirmation through sentinel sites thank you nestor for your reminders about covid fatigue um i think everyone is aware we've been experiencing our highest number of new cases for the last couple of weeks now uh we're really sort of you know this word gets overused but we really are sort of in an unprecedented time here in new mexico for a coveted transmission we've never seen a new case counts this high and um you know it's not just a function of increased testing we really are seeing um symptomatic people who are being hospitalized and if you've followed the daily press releases you can see that our number of deaths is starting to up as well thank you thanks marla um i want to let you know that dr hayes is is not with us today and neither is a carissa culbreth from the new mexico tricare lab they'll both be back with us next week um marla i wanted to just go ask you a couple questions uh heather brislen i think we you answered heather's questions is there a place online to the doh where you can track flute uh trends and you answered her questions um and fred fox um asked how is funding for covid response holding up at the state level um that was a question i wanted to see if you might be able to answer yeah i don't um have sort of all the details about the different funding sources and where things stand from a budget perspective in new mexico but you know obviously we had that influx of federal funding early on in the pandemic that hasn't really been renewed no new funding has come to the state so we are definitely um you know aware that a lot of that influx of funding through the cares act has been depleted at this point but i don't have sort of the bigger picture idea of you know what that impact is on the state budget or where other funding sources might be coming from you marla um and and one more question uh to you marla given that kind of uptick in cases all around the states um all around the state of new mexico our schools um are going to change their a plan to you know to have any kind of hybrid situation are going to remain virtual for the time being i think largely many of those decisions are being made at the school district level um so for example albuquerque public schools said a couple of months ago they would not resume any in-person learning until after the first of the year at the soonest other other districts have gone ahead with their hybrid model and if you look at the um public education department website you can see some of the documents that have been developed to guide schools um who are having in-person learning about uh you know when they may need to uh quarantine students um how students are being cohorted um and what thresholds have been created for deciding that a school that's opened to in-person learning might need to close and so that's all sort of driven by the number of school associated cases um and if those are among in person or distance cohorts so it's very much a work in process no one has sort of this figured out we're looking at other states who've come before us with in-person learning how they've handled uh school outbreaks and i think you know we get varying information um from week to week as new studies are published about how children contribute to the spread of kovid and so it's you know been a very dynamic process to try to decide um in conjunction with schools and local districts how best to respond thanks marla so much really appreciate all your all the the public health input um as as as you do every week just wanted to go to the kind of the top of the chat and ask a question and then kind of turn it over to uh dr thornton um this is a question from kim joy um she said a patient asked her today about possibly getting the mmr vaccine nester to protect against covid have you seen any studies or evidence about this no there was some uh i remember some editorials and and podcasts uh commenting on the on the probable use of mmr um and the idea was that if you if you use a live vaccine and in this case these are the combination of three live virus you can sort of uh you know perk up or stimulate the innate immune system but i think um and there were some study plans i haven't really seen any publication of those studies that were more retrospective uh but i think with the with the with the availability in the near future of specific vaccines i think the issue of mmr is taking sort of a second uh place and and also bce was also uh considered as a way to to just stimulate the innate immune system but i think and it was based on the observation that that we saw at the beginning of the epidemic especially in china that kids were not affected apparently were not affected but as more countries became uh you know affected by the by the pandemic we started seeing cases in kids and the and the multi-inflammatory syndrome so kids are not really protected because they have uh multiple vaccinations so so i think that that idea has gone down somewhat i haven't seen the publication of any prospective trial using mmr as a protective and i think because we're having the you know phase two and three of many candidate vaccine uh the enthusiasm for for mmr has really gone down but it was a thought it was thought based on on the observation in kids and also based on some basic science data on innate immune system that and the observation comes from many years that after after live vaccinations or kids there was sort of a decrease in the respiratory infections with other viruses and this is historic so people said okay if kids are not affected if kids after they have vaccination they get less common cold maybe it will work for kobe but we haven't really seen any hard data in that direction thanks nestor so much um back to you carla thank you joanna um marley i just want to go back to you for a couple of questions um do you have can you talk a little bit about contact tracing and how that's actually going now that there are so many more cases and how the department of health is able to to manage that yeah as you can imagine we're really um struggling under the increased burden of new cases being identified you know we must contact each of those cases individually and get them on the phone in order to identify their contacts and start the contact tracing so keeping up with the you know more than 800 new cases each day reaching them by phone to make that initial contact and then getting the list of their contacts um as you can imagine is no small amount of work um we do have um over 200 people more than 250 i believe hired through our contact tracing unit um who are dedicated to this work each day they don't have other job responsibilities um you know this is what they do um day in and day out and so we have a lot of human resources and um you know uh different technology platforms that have been devoted to this process but as we have more community spread you know that contact tracing becomes a bit less effective because people may have multiple exposures and not just um the contact that we're identifying so it becomes a little more difficult to really find all all people who've been exposed and make sure that they're quarantining when people may have multiple exposures uh based upon the community incidents in their location thank you and just one more um i know i don't know if i don't think you mentioned this but there was a question that came in in the pre-registrations do we know what specific behavior is pushing the current surge if we look at um information that we get from uh contact interviews so our case interviews it seems to be a variety of things um you know i think we had this you know wonderful period in the late summer where we had very low case counts um we were all lulled into thinking um you know maybe we were over the worst of it and there um people report an uptick in um group activities so you know that can be everything from uh dining or uh gym attendance to just um you know household get-togethers so people who are getting together with their extended family um in their homes we've seen uh you know an uptick of people reporting that kind of activity as well and then as you know more businesses reopened and people returned to work um you know there were more opportunity again for those community exposures so you know nothing about the virus has changed that we're aware of it's just really people's behaviors um that have changed that is really driving this increase thank you very much marla um nestor just back to your presentation there was a question by um bob gish about do you know which interferon was used in those studs in the study that you reported about the the use of interferon no not really but they have used i mean not in this in solidarity i forgot but they were using basically interferon alpha and interferon beta beta so that's that's what we're using and and there are trials both uh subcutaneous and also nebulized interferon but i i don't remember so solidity was what were they using really i have to look back thank you mister um jeff miller do you want to meet yourself and just ask your question about the oxygen saturation it's a great question sure this is jeff miller a family practice in albuquerque so given that uh we're at an elevation much higher 5 000 plus or minus uh the uh you know my question is the the pulse ox of 92 or above is is often not relevant for many of my patients who are regularly sitting at 89 to 91 and not feeling short of breath so either in the hospital setting or otherwise is there a sort of accepted pulse ox reading for our elevation as to uh when uh that's too low regardless of whether someone's short of breath or not right no i i don't know i have asked dr harkins in a couple of occasions and there's some variability in the answer i mean there's like there's a way to calculate i'm not a pulmonologist but there's a way to adjust for the altitude and you can calculate what the expected um uh oxygen is in in a person but i haven't really gotten a good answer and for instance we in the in some of the clinical trials it's it favors us because the inclusion criteria is 94. so it's not difficult to get a person in our trust so in that way we give the benefit of the doubt to the patient if you come with a you know radiographic pneumonia and a clinical picture of kobe and you have knight e3 uh you know that patient enters the story because the criteria was not adjusted for for altitude in the protocol so but i don't really know the the specific number if we you know how low do we go depending on if it's in here in albuquerque or santa fe or some other local i don't really know i and i i can i can come back to you and ask again uh our icu and pulmonary people because i don't really i don't have an answer for that thank you nestor if there's anybody on the network right now who's a pulmonologist or a respiratory therapist or someone who has this knowledge themselves they could please let us they can unmute themselves and and and educate us or chat me and i'll i'll i'll i'll call you i'll call on you all right so um nestor the um get there's a question says given the solidarity trial what role do you see for room deserver and treatment of coven 19 do you use it only in patients on supplemental oxygen hospitalized but not mechanically ventilated that's that's exactly correct i mean the the role based on the beagle story uh the the you know the place where we need to use that it's in patients who have been hospitalized and that require oxygen basically because there was no benefit in those who did not require oxygen and very little benefit on those really on mechanical ventilation or ecmo so there's sort of a small window and in general i would say early rather than late i mean all all the evidence points toward you know you have to use it really early not when the patient obviously uh it's on the way to to be discharged or in a way to go into the icu and intubation so those are the other things and and uh i think probably in solidarity because of the design it was used on you know all over the place patiently severe disease patient earlier late so so it's kind of harder to distinguish exactly you know the degree of severity based on their p publication as opposed to the beagle in which they actually classify the patients you know before getting the the rendezvous so they know which group benefit the most so i think that's that's the the place and and also remember that we haven't been able to show uh benefit immortality so only only shortening of disease by five days in the in the nih trial uh but no more than that and they enrolled more than a thousand patients 1062 if i remember correctly and they were not able to prove a statistical significant difference in the mortality there was a trend towards lower mortality but it was not statistically significant so so you know it's it's a it's effective you can make an argument that it's effective but it's not a dramatic uh you know really cure or anything close to that it's it's just shortened the disease uh due to his antiviral activity thank you and one more question about um treatment uh deborah mcgrew asked given the dismal news about effective medications for use in covet is there a general consensus that dexamethasone is still good quote unquote or effective yeah is the only one with data from a control trial that shows decreased mortality the recovery trial and there's a meta-analysis of all the other trials i think it were seven trials and it showed a decrease in the mortality around you know 40 percent decreased mortality um and and and it's in some ways the opposite of rendezvous is shown to be more effective somewhat later than early so people with more than seven days or ten days of symptom initiation seem to benefit more and and you can you can make an argument although it was not a statistically significant that if you use it too early it's deleterious it was a negative um result or or less less of a benefit if you use it really early so that's that's that's basically but yeah it's the only thing that has survived the test of time so far um the dexamethasone thank you nestor and marla back to you you may have seen this in the chat from jeff miller it's a really great question just but maybe you can talk about it uh just if there's anything we can do as is people in the community seeing people that have coveted to sort of sort of start this process of contact tracing or um any way that we can help because if the cases continue at this level it's just it will be impossible as you know for for for to keep up yeah absolutely thank you it's it's a great question and there's definitely a lot that providers can do to help us so when you when you have a case who you've tested because you suspect they have covered um even while you're awaiting test results but also if you're calling patients to inform them of their test results helping reiterate the isolation guidance for people um you know i think it doesn't hurt for people to get that guidance from multiple sources and have it repeated so that they understand um you know what's being asked of them and what isolation means asking them to think about the people that they've been in close contact with in the two days prior to their illness onset up until the time they're isolated or in the two days prior to their um test collection and really getting you know those names and phone numbers organized so that when the case uh investigator reaches them they've got that information ready you know very often people say well i don't know i'll have to you know think about it and get some information together and call you back and that just delays the contact tracing so asking people um to start thinking about that when they've been informed of their positive test results would be very helpful um and then we you know often ask people when we have them on the phone and we inform them of their initial test results you know um if they've let their close contacts or their employers or their other family members know um that they're positive so also nothing stopping um your patients from reaching out to people that they know they've been in close contact with and giving them that heads up so that they can start their quarantine immediately and they're not waiting um you know necessarily for someone from the department of health to call and give them that guidance and even if a person tells us they've already spoken to their close contacts we'll collect that information and reach out to them as well because we do try to monitor um contacts through contact tracing it's still something we're trying to do we were you know monitoring people daily we're now doing it you know every other day checking in with people we know who have been exposed to see if they've developed symptoms or um had a positive test um so we also still are trying to keep up with that um but definitely there's a lot you guys can do to help us in terms of getting that messaging out and asking people to start thinking about their contacts so again it's two days prior to their illness onset 48 hours prior to their illness onset up until the time that they're isolated um or you know the two days prior to their positive test if they're asymptomatic so thinking about everyone they may have been in close contact with during that time period and getting that information organized so they're ready when they uh are first contacted is very helpful thank you so much and before i leave we leave the public health everyone's very interested in in this at this moment but um david tempest asks is there any value in testing people who are not close contacts not symptomatic and not in a congregant setting or does it does this have any surveillance failure is it just wasting tests you know especially when we um you know don't have a lot of widespread activity that surveillance testing you know is a bit more uh useful because you're identifying disease where you don't know disease exists um i think from a testing capacity standpoint you know people who are symptomatic and people who are known contacts are always going to be a high priority for testing and then um you know sort of cascading down from there to the general public when we have a testing capacity available so always you know prioritizing uh symptomatic folks and people with known exposures thank you very much um so nestor i'm going to go back into the pre-registration questions is any are there any treatments or any information on residual covet effects such as altered smell or hair loss app let's see i'm not sure quite understand this question um cindy it's h-o-a-n-g are you on are you on the network i don't see her um let's see nestor what uh one of the questions came from uh christy thomas in columbus new mexico what are the biggest barriers to vaccine development and distribution so far well i think um let me let me start with just vaccine initially obviously this is a new virus so so a relatively new virus has been it's been around for for less than a year so i think developing um a safe and effective vaccine and tested in enough people that you can generate you know the confidence of the public i think is the the biggest hurdle and and and really to be honest it had moved tremendously fast i mean i have never seen from genome in in january to to the first phase three studies in september it's been amazingly fast and and we are you know we're gonna have a vaccine at least some some data of preliminary efficacy and safety in december so so it's i think it's amazing but i think the fact that it's new and some of the platforms that are that are being used have not not been used in vaccines previously like the mrna um and some others are are relatively new using nanoparticles or or a mix of two different adenoviruses so so there's a lot of new technologies that are included in this vaccine so that's what is so critical to to look at the efficacy and safety data and then distribution is going to be another issue because uh initially obviously uh the production is going to ramp up but it's it's going to be gradual so so actually most of the and marla can comment on this most of the states are preparing to do sort of a stage-wise deployment of the vaccine you're not going to you know open the vaccination like like we do with the flu that it's in every in every walgreens or or or cvs it's actually something that's probably going to be like a stage one for healthcare workers then to another level and another level and probably well into the 2021 will will have more more data and the other thing is that the vaccine is initially being studied in adults john adults so we need to gather enough data in elderly folks and also in pediatric population before it can be granted approval so so it's going to be some time for for that and also for the production and distribution and this is something that is going to occur worldwide so some of these countries some of these companies are actually working with all the governments and with wa show and and gabi and some other multilateral organizations to get the vaccine ready for distribution so i think it's going to be you know something that we've never seen before ever uh with this degree of of coordination and collaboration across many states and countries for this vaccine to be to be available i want to make a comment on the on the contact racing obviously i'm not an expert i'm like really learning learning by reading and seeing the comments by marla but there's also something important that i think is important i have seen a couple of papers on something that people call reverse contact tracing it's actually when you when you see a patient you try to see who they may have infected you know so that's what we go 48 hours before and and and and forward but actually if you can identify who infected that person if you can say okay this person went to a rock concert that wasn't not allowed but he was in a rock concert 10 days ago or was in a birthday party with with uh you know with several people that's also important it may be beyond the two days that the person is infected but you can actually find another or find a super spreader event or some uh you know interesting activity that may have happened a few days before because remember the incubation period of the disease is between five and you know it's between three and 14 days so so the person could have been infected a week before when they went to to uh to sturgis in the motorcycle event for instance and you can actually obviously you can track down and if you if you find that extraordinary event you can actually discover more people and do some more testing using that reverse contact tracing it's kind of complicated because people don't don't always volunteer that they went to a party or they had like this huge gathering but it's something to to think about when you see a patient and ask them you know have you been you know together have you done a party have you been to a to some type of congregation to the church and they actually meet inside the church or or this something even it will it was not allowed by the by the current rules it's important to identify other people that may have been infected in a in a spreader event thank you thank you mister um dan saltman do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question it sounds like several people are interested in that sure thank you thank you nestor um so and that study you showed at the beginning of the of your talk that you reviewed the the median duration of viral shedding was longer than what we usually use as the standard for uh return to work or end isolation uh recommendations so that which i think is 10 days after either the positive test or the end of symptoms so would you recom would you how would you uh what would how would you comment on the on resolving that that recommendation or if there is need for a an update of that recommendation based on that study right yeah thank you for the question no no actually i do not uh and and let me just remind this story was actually a review of 77 stories so it was very heterogeneous group of studies some of these viral shedding were from patients who were really sick in the icu especially from the early part of the epidemic most of the reports were from patients really severe severely ill and we know that those patients can uh have viral sheddings over you know the usual 10 days and that's i think why the recommendation from cdc is 10 days for those with you know regular kobe but those with severe uh uh or or critical copied and those immunosuppressed should um maintain the isolation for 20 days um the the the duration of the infectious viral shedding may be longer in some individuals but when you take it as a population based analysis i don't think it changes much the recommendation so i think it's uh although it obviously opened the window a little bit more but probably i don't think it should motivate a change in the recommendation for now because most of the studies show that the viral the the infectious virus goes down after they ate of sentence so definitely by day 10 unless you're immunosuppressed or or are in icu with very very severe copy it should be okay thank you nestor um cindy clarified her question she says i'm a pcp in a primary care setting i'm seeing patients that were infected with cobit several months ago but continue to have altered smell and have increase in hair loss are there any studies or information about the these two symptoms postcoded or how about treating them or helping these patients you know i haven't seen any any on treatment any specific good recommendations on treatment but in fact yeah there have been some reports up to 60 days and uh post copied that people may be experiencing these symptoms and the most recent that i've seen is hair loss before we had a lot of attention in the in the loss of sense of smell and taste uh but obviously also as i mentioned fatigue um respiratory symptoms uh and issues with concentration memory and sleep disorders all of these have have been reported to last um you know longer longer than than two a month after after copied in some patients so yeah it's something that we've seen i don't know about management i haven't really seen any any specific recommendation for any of these uh except for like rehab or pulmonary you know pulmonary rehab physical therapy for those who have fatigue uh but really nothing specific regarding like like an intervention or or or a therapy i think the next step will be to to try to study the the pathophysiology to see if this is an immunological thing it's if it's a virus in a sanctuary place still don't know so so i think understanding that will help us find some effective effective treatment although i'm not very optimistic because really with chronic fatigue syndrome and other spiral syndrome that we know for many many years there are not great therapies i mean they're they're people you know testing different therapies but there's no like an accepted um you know dramatic uh drug that can that can actually change the course of the disease in the short run thank you very much and um i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme link just went into the chat if you're interested in getting cme and we would love to have your feedback as well um nestor fred fox asks a question about the rapid antigen test the binax now is it's apparently being distributed to the states this question is has new mexico received these if so how many and how will they be distributed do you have that information no i don't know if mark i don't i do not know we were still using trichos pcr essentially except for very few that we have for like patients that are going to go through our emergency procedures or others we have a very limited number of rapid tests but for the great majority of patients and and even asymptomatic we're doing pcr on all of them thank you marla did you have any other comments yeah we have um received some of the binax cards here in new mexico and i i have an email somewhere talking about that more that i was looking for that i can't find um but some facilities like nursing homes have received binax cards shipped to them directly some have been shipped to our state public health lab and so the state public health lab is sort of the steward of some of those resources right now in terms of helping decide the appropriate use for those binax cards in monitoring of facility-based outbreaks for example they really much like the other antigen and rapid point of care test are really only indicated for people who are symptomatic so not being deployed for screening testing in a widespread way right now thank you marla and i think we have time for one more question um mark do you mark um do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question sure hi uh mark conversat here um primary care in albuquerque i i was wondering if the i would tuned into the uh global echo um conference about a month ago where one of the presenters from the netherlands showed some data they had an outbreak in a nursing home and they thought it was attributed to people attending a church service and then visiting the nursing home and then she showed the genotypic data which contradicted that i'm wondering if if new mexico is doing any of that genotyping to help confirm or just to help support the epidemiologic tracing thanks thank you mark marla yeah the department of health is doing some of that work in conjunction with cdc and los alamos national labs um you know the the time frame for that though is you know it's not sort of available quick enough to be used for current case investigations and uh current contact tracing um it's more for uh at the understanding of disease transmission and trying to see if specific outbreaks are linked to each other in the way that we maybe thought they were based upon a case investigation and contact tracing data so it's more of a epi surveillance tool right now than something that's available rapidly enough to be used in active contact tracing or case investigations thank you so much well thank you everyone for joining today i just wanted to um remind everybody to fill out the cme if they are interested and if you give us feedback um i wanted to let you know there's a there's a first responder echo this afternoon from two to three and the topic is police peer support response during cover 19 pandemic which sounds very interesting and the next critical care echo is not this week but will be next thursday that november 5th from 8 to 9 with with michelle harkins um and please visit our website if you have other if you would like to look for other resources and we're very happy to have you join this every week if you have questions bring them back next week and we'll we'll have a another session so thank you so much for joining and we'll see everybody next week,,10/26/2020
25,hi everybody can you hear me great okay super welcome everybody to our infectious disease office hours echo it's november 2nd and um we wanted to start right on time since i think there's going to be um lots of information i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i work at project echo and and unm hospital in the the pain center and i want to introduce my colleague carla thornton carla do you want to just say hi real quick sure thank you joanna carla thornton here i'm you um infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo welcome everyone thanks thanks carla wanted to let everyone uh know to just um keep your video on mute if you can just to eliminate some extra noise but we love to see your face so if you have a webcam a camera please turn that on so we can see you and you can see us it's in line with the echo model we don't mind at all if you eat it's lunch time here in mountain time um in new mexico but many of you are in different time zones and that and that's just great uh we do have our um digital librarian on and uh they're they're going to be copying uh putting things in the browser that are evidence-based evidence guided materials and you can just copy what looks good to you and put that into your own your own browser at about 45 minutes after the hour you should be getting a cme link where you can get your no cost cme and even if you don't need that please take the time to fill it out and let you know and let us know what you think about us it really does help we do look at these uh thoughtfully and and try to make changes based on the program well we have a lot um a lot of information starting with our own with our leader uh fearless leader nestor sosa who's the division head and in charge of infectious diseases at unm hospital um and he's gonna lead us off with a with the powerpoint following by followed by leslie hayes thanks nestor thank you johanna and carla let me just put this in the big screen thing here there you go okay so hello everyone just uh before i go into the into the articles um i just want to remind everybody that the cases are really going up i mean we have a lot of new patients in the hospital so i think we need to continue this this seeming seemingly endless fight against kobe 19 and double our efforts to to prevent and then to mask up and social distance and everything so let me let me go through some of the some of the papers really today's it's most of the papers that i'm going to review are are interesting are somewhat cool um we have the first um solid data on the on one of the monoclonals the eli lily monoclonal which is actually the name it's uh lyse cove virus 555 um it's not the one that was given to president trump is the other the other uh company but it's interesting that they published they published their experience the phrase two in the new england journal um a couple of days ago uh and and the title of the paper is sars kobe 2 neutralizing antibody um co-555 in outpatient with coverage so this this was a study in which they provided the the the antibody by injection via injection is an intra intravenous infusion in patients with relatively early disease less than three days since they had been tested and they had mild to moderate covet so these were not icu patients were actually outpatients with mild symptoms and and then they follow them they actually enroll uh you know quite significant number of patients but a hundred received seven seven hundred million hundred and one received 700 milligram 107 800 and 101 7 000 they were testing different doses and there are more doses but they didn't publish the results of the other intermediate doses and then 143 patients were assigned to the to the placebo arm the distribution between the patients who received the the monoclonal and those who are placebo was very similar median age 45 30 were older than 65 in the in the monoclonal 20 uh where in the placebo group um so relatively well balanced uh both uh both arms of the of the study um the the main finding of the primary outcome was actually regarding viral law they measure viral load at different at different points but the primary outcome was to see if they were able to clear the viral shedding or rna shedding because they were measuring really rna by day 11 and they did find an overall decrease in the in the in the in the um percentage of patients who were who clear the the virus in the in the monoclonal arm but it was not the statistically significant and in fact um interestingly enough the intermediate dose was more effective as you can see -4 as opposed to the three point 700 seven and the seven thousand three point three eight so you know sort of uh you know we're finding that that uh there was no dos those uh uh effect it was actually the intermediate those were seem to be better than the other the small and the large though so it's something that no not very clear uh to me the other uh finding which was not related really to treatment was sort of uh of uh they were able because they did so so so much uh intensive buyer load measurements they were able to to find a correlation between being hospitalized and having a high viral load independent of treatment this is as i said not something related to treatment and this this uh graph illustrates that you can see um uh in these uh square uh squares are the the c the ct the threshold which is sort of an indirect measure of the of the buyer load and and the buyer load was as you expect going down as the day move but they noticed that those who did not have a really a decrease in the viral load were hospitalized so there was a correlation between not being able to lower your viral load independent of if you receive placebo or the or the of the treatment but having a high bar low correlated with with um with being hospitalized so that was sort of uh something unexpected that they didn't uh they didn't anticipate it in the in the trial but they uh published this graph in the paper saying that they were served the other finding which was also not statistically significant was the percentage of hospitalizations in the different groups and they found that those received placebo a near hospitalization in around 6.3 percent of the cases um and those who received the the the three doses of of the monoclonal the frequency of hospitalization was 1.6 they didn't publish any statistics so i calculated a chi square and there was no this there's no statistical significance in this group overall uh between 6 and 1.6 for the number that they had although they did um mention that on in those patients with more than 65 years of age or a bmi of more than 35 so presumably a patient with high risk of complication the antibody did show a significantly decreased frequency of hospitalization 15 in those who receive placebo versus 4 and i i calculated a p of 0.007 in that group but that was not a primary objective so so the study was not designed to prove that what it was interesting that at least in the high-risk patients um there was some protection from hospitalization meaning protection from getting worse um and and there was also a slight but overlap overlapping um improvement in symptoms you can see that the blue which is the the pool uh monochrome antibody was kind of lower so the the scale of symptoms was better the improvement was better with the monoclonal as opposed to the placebo so you know the there was sort of a tendency towards uh rapid or more rapid alleviation of symptoms in those who received the monoclonal but again non-statistically significant so so you know this trial sort of uh you know didn't have any red flags but it really wasn't wasn't very uh dramatic i mean most of the differences were not statistically significant were just uh numerically different uh but not statistically significant so we have to we have to wait this is an interim analysis we need to we need to wait for the for the for the larger trial the the whole group with all the doses to really have an analysis or a phase three with with not hundreds of patients with actually thousands of patients to see uh if these monoclonals are are effective in preventing hospitalization with or decreasing the wire law which were the the objective and i i just want to mention that i mean monochrome antibodies as you know they are derived from from convalescent plasma they need to be produced they're really expensive we have experience with monoclonal antibodies in other diseases in cancer in in rheumatologic diseases and we know that you know a single bile of these monoclonals usually go by you know several thousand dollars so but there's something i think cooler than the monoclonal antibody antibodies people are are looking for other alternative and interestingly enough alpacas these these mammals that are are prevalent in south america they actually produce sort of a smaller antibody they don't have all the heavy and light change like a regular antibody a conventional human antibody they're actually smaller and they have been able to prove that you can you can use this uh the the active part the the part that attaches to the to the to the epitope and use it as and they call it nanobody so there are investigators working on developing these nanobodies which which with some chemical modification can be really stable can be uh easier to produce because they can be mass producing in in animals uh or synthetizing in viral in bacterial cultures so it's interesting that they were going to look and in fact there's a publication on an alpaca nanobody neutralizes our scoby2 so they were able to prove and here the antibodies are in blue this is the the spike protein in different position they rotate 180 and 90 degrees and the important thing is that the this antibodies seem to attach to the to the uh to the active side the area where the where the the the the spy protein uh meets the h2 receptor and and neutralizes the the effect of the of the of the protein so these tiny or nanobodies can can actually work and if they can be mass produced they may be cheaper and easier to produce alternative to the full blown monoclonal antibodies and and the other thing that that people are studying are called are called our mini proteins inhibitors in which they actually what they did this is again the spike protein this is the ace the receptor and they look at specifically what part of the ace protein attaches to the to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and then they they actually synthesize this piece of protein from the whole age just a smaller protein and they prove that they can actually inhibit the the union of the spike protein to the ace by using these um so-called mini proteins which are not antibodies it's just like a like a mimics part of the ace receptor so i think it's a clever idea and the other way to do it is simply to take uh like a library of proteins that these companies usually have and with computer animation try to to test which one attaches better and then use it in animal models and human models so i think these are are probably going to be the future after monoclonal antibodies or if one of chronic antibodies are not effective these are things that may maybe develop in the in the near future but i thought it was it was nice to see what their uh researchers are looking uh for this into the future the other the other paper that i want to present are it's about the the durability of kobe 19 and if you remember we presented probably a couple of months ago data on on how worried we were because the antibodies um that we produce after an infection seems to wane after a few uh weeks or or two or three months um but there's new information more robust information and in fact they called it the paper robust neutralizing antibodies to search kobe 2 infection persist for month this group from new york actually um study almost 20 000 patients um during the outbreak in new york and they measure the the using elisa and using natural neutralization the levels of antibodies so this is this is pretty um you know remarkable data because it's not like the previous stories were like 100 patients 50 patients now we're talking really a large population of patients that had um sar scoby 2 or kobe 19 and and you know they found that the great majority of patient developed some some uh reaction over 95 of the patient had some degree of of um positive antibodies and they found also a good correlation between elisa so the regular measure of antibodies and neutralization there's actually a linear uh correlation between those two so you can use the elisa and the regular serology test as a surrogate marker for for neutralizing antibody which is good it's important from the practical standpoint and they found that a lot of almost 40 of the group had very high antibodies like over you know 3 000 one in 3 000 another sizable percentage one third had at least one in 960 so so a significant proportion of patient develop at least early on at good levels of antibodies um which correlate with neutralizing antibodies that we said and then the decay it's it's in their opinion what's really minimal as you can see this is all the way to day 148 um the decay is relatively uh mild uh the overall title titles um obviously if you have a very high title it goes down goes down a little bit but still you know 140 days the medium was around 960. so this this is sort of good news at least for for a few months we are supposed to have neutralizing antibodies and antibodies in general circulating after starch cov2 um and i think this data it's more credible than than small subset of patients that have been studied in the in the past uh and the the other paper that i want to talk about and and bear with me this is this is sort of a more anthropological paper than than than medicine but i thought it was really interesting uh you know and the question is what is the link between the argan tells uh the homo sapiens ardentalis and and kobe 19 and actually there are two papers that that um if you remember we have been discussing like looking for association between some genetic marker and severe disease and in fact they published this on on the 15 i think of october in the new england journal they did uh genome-wide association g was association so they look at all the all the snips all the single nucleotide uh variations in the in a group of of patients with kobe 19 and controls and then they found actually two areas two signals one in chromosome three and another one in chromosome nine the one in chromosome nine has not been validated and it's really weak association and is a relationship with the avo block group but more interestingly they found a strongest signal around chromosome 3 and actually another paper in nature actually proved that this is the main the main genetic marker for severity of disease or the most important in genome-wide association uh you know and it affects actually a large section of the of the dna there are approximately six genes that that may be implicated or related to these uh to these uh variations but the interesting thing is that um these guys vanta pablo it's it's one of the researchers who have looked into ancient dna in in in near dentals in ancient modern humans and also denisovans and he and and google server published this paper because they found that this specific part of the chromosome um it's a approximately 50 000 uh it's inherit from the near dentals and they and indeed this paper obviously they go through all the methodology um explaining that but i think the the easiest thing to understand is that they they put um the different um types of these 50 aprotypes from from you know from people that have been studied in the human genome product and they found that in in pink is the area uh with the with the abnormal haplotype the hepatite that predispose you to to to having severe coming and they actually found that it was the closest association with within the argentina that died 60 000 years ago in the india uh which is i think the south of croatia um so they found that that these modern humans or or actually you know copied patients who have severe copy and this variation where the their dna that part of the dna in chromosome 5 was very similar to the to the this person uh disney ardental person from the bindija region in croatia so what practical repercussion has that is that you can actually look for the ordinal genes in the different parts of the world and in fact in bangladesh and some parts of india a sizeable percentage of the population are heterozygous for these predisposing genes so it's interesting and in fact if you there's a paper or actually a communication from the england in which they found that people from bangladeshi background have almost two times more risk of having severe covets so you know sort of to put this together so in this area there's a higher penetrance of the gains from the ardentails and they do seems to have a more severe clinical course so we don't know why you know this gene and why they are dentals and not the nissa ones the other uh you know hominids that were you know walking around 60 to 100 000 years over earth but obviously they mixed with us they gave us this piece of dna and unfortunately this specific piece of dna seems to be um associated with severe disease so i thought it was interesting um i took anthropology in my in my medicine class and it's the first time in 50 years that i can use the little thing that i learned in anthropology and finally just just a headline the cdc published that the multi-system inflammatory syndrome has also been reported in adults i think they went into describe in these cases i i didn't have time to read them in detail but i will probably will in the next so so at least the multi unfortunately the multi-inflammatory syndrome doesn't just only affect kids but also seems to be affecting older older people in a similar fashion so we have to follow these and this is a sort of a post-infectious um phenomenal i think that's it i took a long time sorry no no nestor you're good we we learned so much from your presentation so thank you so much nestor um for for everybody on board here um please chat in your questions you have from dr sosa and we're going to move right on now to dr hayes is going to be sharing her slides with us as you know leslie is a family medicine and addiction medicine physician in northern new mexico at el centro and she is going to be presenting a little bit of good news thanks leslie i don't know about the rest of you but every time i have looked at either the new mexico or national statistics this week i burst into tears and uh i just thought everybody might deserve a little bit of good news especially uh with the election i think we're all stressed so i went to find good covert news this week so first thing taiwan and australia both have had no new cases taiwan has actually at this point gone 200 days without a confirmed locally transmitted covid case which i just think is amazing and australia actually recorded zero new covet cases for the first time in five months um my daughter was actually living in melbourne uh this year and she was planning to leave melbourne um actually the day they went into lockdown and they had to frantically rent a car and drive across the border to get to sydney because of the lockdown but it clearly worked because australia has had no new coveted cases for the first time in five months and then i thought this was really pretty nifty there's two new mexico tech scientists and they're working on a nasal spray to protect against covid19 and apparently it's just going to be a barrier method and they found that it they initially designed it to work against multi-drug-resistant bacteria and fungi and they altered it to protect against covid19 when they put it in a petri dish it killed 99.977 percent of cobia bio particles and they're doing human studies and they expect it to be both cheap and over the counter and you would just basically need to spray it in your nose like an every hour all day and if it worked i thought that would just be a really nice thing to have and then mortality from cobia 19 is decreasing so um this particular study they examined discharges and mortality from 5000 hospitalizations for covet 19 in three new york hospitals and they adjusted it for demographic factors such as age sex and race and ethnicity admission vital signs and any comorbidities because what they did find was from march through i think it was july they were looking at it that people admitted tended to be younger and tended to have fewer comorbidities which i think is actually a good thing because it does seem like hospitalizing people early does make a difference in mortality rate but what they found is for people who were admitted as sick same age same comorbidities they were less likely to die and so the um blue green here line is the actual mortality and then they adjusted it for all of the comorbidities in the age and what you can see is it has just gone steadily down from march through august so that is reassuring even though none of the treatments we have are great it does seem like additive adding them together has really made a difference in the mortality rate so and then this made me very happy flu vaccine is way up um cvs has already given as many shots to date as it gave during the entire flu season last year they expect to double the number of flu shots by the end of uh this year walgreens has also administered 60 more and um the cdc has said that manufacturers are producing record numbers of flu shots to meet the demand and they have distributed many more at this point in the season than last year so oops let me go back and then just a few other articles of interest these are not necessarily cheerful and good news but i thought they were interesting um peter hotez is this wonderful vaccine scientist if anybody's interested in one of the best books on vaccines is his book on um vaccines didn't cause rachel's autism he has a daughter who's on the autism spectrum and he talks about vaccine safety but this particular one was on anti-science extremism in america and how it's sort of being exported around the world and it was quite interesting um robin i don't know how to say her name shown thaler i think is a cancer doc in boston who writes a lot of articles about covid this particular one on medium was really really good on you know is it worth it to have thanksgiving how can you do it safely basically hold it outside quarantine for 14 days ahead of time um and i think it's well worth sharing with um anyone you know about whether or not you should be having a thanksgiving dinner this year and then um this article was an editorial from usa today that i really liked about trump is wrong to accuse medical professionals of profiting from diagnosing coped 19 and they were from multiple different specialties and then this twitter thread by dr ashish jaw was on why hospitals actually do get paid slightly more if they diagnose covert 19 but it doesn't mean that there's fraud or incorrect data and i thought it was really useful i sort of knew it at some level what he was talking about but it really explained in great detail exactly why hospitals are getting paid more and why this is actually a good thing and does not give us incentive to over diagnose or commit fraud and then this new york times article was so cool they basically went down to the molecular level on masks and showed you little viral particles floating through and how the masks actually work to take them out and it's worth it just for the graphics and then rana oddish is um intensivist in i believe michigan and she wrote a wonderful book on her own experience as being critically ill she wrote an article about taking care of covid patients and what it's like for the medical professionals called the shape of the shore that's in 2020 intima and it's well worth reading and just a reminder to vote and that's all i have thank you dr hayes as usual just like dr sosa we're so appreciative of your information uh i think i would like to turn now to dr carissa culbreth who's the medical director at tri-core labs i think uh carissa is on and has a couple of things that to say hi good morning um i am on but i don't have any slides today um so i'm happy to just take questions on um testing um there have been some just testing updates here locally in new mexico um and nationally and so just happy to take any questions related to testing as well as related to testing for other respiratory viruses so happy to take any questions thanks carissa i'm sure there's going to be um ample questions we're so happy to have you on great so um i'm going to start with a few questions and then turn it over to uh dr thornton here um you see um you know nestor i had a question for you related to just your great article about the um monoclonal antibody with that lily um can you compare that to the clinical trials that were done by the regeneron a monoclonal antibody um is it about a similar efficacy so far or does regeneron seem to be slightly more efficacious can you remark on that yeah yeah thank you yeah general has not published its results yet they they have like uh sort of a press release that they share with their investors so the information is somewhat limited but it seems to be the same data they uh they especially in patients who do not have antibodies preform antibodies or who have some risk factors they tend to to be protected from hospitalization and they seem to lower the viral load faster than the placebo so because remember we with kobe 19 normally people drop their vital load after eight days a lot of the patients are not you know having excretions so so it is expected to go down but it seems to go down faster with this monoclonal especially if given to patients have not mounted a response apparently the the the you know the advantage of giving if you give it too late this probably doesn't make any difference and in fact um some of these trials have been stopped um because they they see no no advantage in in the advanced patient patients who are already in the hospital with mechanical ventilation actually the data safety monitoring borrower of general general actually stopped the story to look at the data more carefully because they they saw some type of safety um signal but this is all you know in lay press we have to wait for for the for the publication to actually you know bite on this on this uh new information but i think yeah if you ask me based on what i've seen with eli lilly and rajenderon they're going to be useful early uh really early and especially in those patients who do not have their own antibodies so they have to be given very short after you you develop the disease if it's going to be used with the disease uh there's also they're also doing studies on prevention so people like in nursing homes another high risk situation as a pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis to decrease the the possibility of being infected but but so far we've we have only seen in mild disease um and it seems to have some advantages early but we have to wait for the data leslie hey sir how would they choose you to give it to you since i mean what i'm reading is that they'll have a hundred thousand doses at the end of the month and we're getting almost that many patients a day at this point it just seems like are there any estimates on how they're going to decide who to give it to no no honestly i haven't seen that and i mean this is an ib uh base case scenario they maybe i am but it's it's a parental therapy it has to be given really early i mean from the experience that we have gathered in the hospital here enrolling patients for the in the rendezvous trial you know patients usually develop symptoms and they hang around for like three or four days before they actually come into the hospital and then they get tested and the test result takes obviously a few more hours maybe up to one day so when you are actually giving these these drugs if you decide to give it it's gonna be you know day four day five maybe later in the disease so so it's really difficult to implement this parental therapy like really early on because i don't anticipate people having like a you know twenty five thousand dollar a vial of regeneron in their in their you know in their medicines at home so so you have to be even really early you have to make diagnosis really quickly and then get the infusion rapidly like like they did with with uh with uh with the president uh otherwise it's it's probably not gonna be that effective so thank you nestor um i wanted to see if dr uh cybold if dr harry seibel might want to unmute and ask his questions about the mini proteins all right i had to find my mute button um if uh nestor or any of the panelists had uh come in i wasn't sure on your statement about the picoproteins i had asked a question probably a month and a half ago i'd seen a press release kent looked it up and all we could find was just the press release from the university of pittsburgh medical center or university pennsylvania medical center in pittsburgh about an antibody treatment who i think they call it 8 and it was a small slice of an antibody that they were they were going to market if that was the therapeutic modality that's talked about in the study that you posted today on right now my understanding is this is sort of a copy of the h2 protein so it has some similarity with the with the area of the receptor it's not really an antibody like the nanobody is an antibody it's a portion of an antibodies i think it's slightly different they are looking for the same thing a protein that attaches to the area where the actual spike protein um meets the the h2 receptor but for this particular uh what they call the the mini proteins uh we're actually just you know protein synthetized um to to to perfectly fit in the escapoli in the area of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein so it's slightly different the idea at the end is the same is preventing the infection of the cell by covering the the spike protein but this is not really an antibody it's actually derived from the from the amino acid sequence of that area where the where the ac inhibitor uh you know attaches to the to the spy protein thank you thank you nestor turning it over to dr thornton thanks um just a question nestor about if you have had coved recently when when can or should you get the flu shot and maybe we can ask leslie what she's telling her patients as well but go ahead to be honest i haven't i haven't thought of that i guess once they are recovered they can get the flu shot but i i don't know what leslie i would say i mean no don't get it while you're febrile and having all the symptoms but as soon as you recover clinically you're probably good to go that's my but i haven't read anything i honestly it's my opinion i haven't really read about the timing and and copied i don't know let's leave you have something with that yeah i actually looked this up and there's no contraindication um i mean the big thing for us is we want them not to be infectious anymore so we're maybe making them wait the 10 days um after uh diagnosis um and um i had somebody get really upset about it um thinking that was ridiculous but i figured that the risk of infecting clinic staff is not worth you know uh giving the flu shot five days early so right thank you um heather brislen can you do you mind on meeting yourself and asking your question my mouth is full i'm sorry yes um so i've had a number of people maybe three different patients asked same question scenario which was okay this person we know just tested positive and so and so had lunch with them on wednesday i saw this the intermediate person on thursday am i now at risk like a secondary exposure second degree exposure and um my thought is you know that person couldn't pass it on to you within 24 hours of their exposure the incubation period is too long the chances that they could get it together to be contagious that quickly is really unlikely and i was just hoping to hear your thoughts because i don't want to be overconfident about my understanding yeah thank you that's a good question and we we deal with that all the time that we're doing contract tracing and and asking and looking for contacts um well the the transmission period really start 48 hours before the symptoms so so if the if the person was with the with the um with a contact earlier than that it's probably no risk so so but sometimes it's hard because sometimes they are and they haven't been tested but we usually use the time of the symptom initiation you go back 48 hours and that's the infectious uh period um but we don't we don't usually recommend quarantine or testing for secondhand exposure in that way because it gets complicated it really gets complicated only only if you were exposed to an index case um but but you know it actually depends on the setting if it's like a congregate setting you can be more flexible you can you can do more testing sort of an enhanced surveillance but really the the mandate is just to to quarantine and test those who have been exposed to an index case if they were supposed 48 hours before and up to eight days after in general i guess is there any this seems like it would take advanced contact tracing or crystal ball to be able to say this but is there is there any sense of what's the shortest incubation period we're seeing from a period of exposure to communicability and that just might not be known right i don't know i honestly don't know i i know the the rule it's minus 20 minus 48 hours um so i don't know and the other difficult thing is patients who are asymptomatic and they get tested because of whatever and then when they when were they it's so hard to establish because if you know maybe you were shedding virus for three days and then you get tested on day four um there's some way to tell because when you're asymptomatic it's very difficult to establish when you started your your viral shedding we go by the you know the 14 day rule for the quarantine and the they rule after the diagnosis but we we don't really know what happened before that if you were asymptomatic because there's no way to tell 48 hours before a while before you got the test probably but who knows it's really more difficult in the practical sense thank you thank you thank you heather for asking that complicated question it is so complicated um let's see karissa um clark was asking does tricore have an estimate on the positivity rate for cobit and any projection the actual rate of virus carriage in new mexico north in the new mexico northwest so right now for our positivity rate we're seeing anywhere between um six and eight percent positivity um but it's really dependent on the um population that's being tested of course we see higher volume higher positivity rates in certain populations i don't have any region specific data in our tricore data but i believe that you can go to the new mexico department of health website and their covid dashboard has some pretty good projections and regional positivities we're actually updating our tri-core website over the next several weeks to be able to include more precise information about both covid and other respiratory viruses and their regional positivity rates but i don't have that data right now thank you carissa and marla sivers our resident public health expert can be on today she sends her apologies um dan saltman do you wanna oh do you wanna unmute yourself and ask your question about vaccine safety sure thank you um thank you thank you everybody for your your uh great information uh let's see they they uh for the vaccine protocols they published the criteria the evaluation criteria and i think that they were going to evaluate the safety uh out eight weeks after the end after the final vaccine and there was the white house was kind of pushing back against that trying to shorten it i was wondering what the what the current that was a maybe two weeks ago or three weeks ago so i was wondering what the current status of that was and whether whether uh it's just remained at eight weeks i mean even eight weeks was seems short to me that's sort of an accelerated accelerated so you know 8 to 12 weeks 12 to 16 weeks to see see if there's any side effects and we all know that drugs have been pulled off the market a year after their release or a couple years after the release so i was wondering about the current status of that of that uh safety evaluation yeah so saying thank you uh daniel this is what the latest thing that i heard the fda had um sort of a town meeting with with the companies with with our researchers yeah i think it was a couple of weeks ago and they actually first um i think that they haven't really published the decision but the comments during the meeting was that they were gonna keep the the eight weeks at least and that they instead of going for an emergency use authorization they were going to use for they were going to go for full licensing so so i think that they are considering being more conservative than than initially what we thought that they were going to give the approval in october or early november and then it was pushed back to december i think now the based on the discussion that i heard from from these uh you know analysis was that they were going to go um you know for a more slow pace try to get gather more information they were not going to stop the trials even if they if they're able to show some efficacy after the eight weeks efficacy and safety those patients should continue on trial um and i think the the end goal is to get the the more uh complete approval that the so-called you know full approval as opposed to just an emergency use authorization based on the concern of the scientists and everybody who were actually really afraid of a very accelerated approval process i think that's the latest i haven't seen any official thing from any of the companies or the fda but that was what was discussed in that meeting um keeping at least the the the two month eight weeks uh to see efficacy and safety but continue the trials and hopefully go for for a more thorough evaluation that includes like inspections of the plants where they manufacture the vaccine and other things that the emergency use authorization seems to bypass so that that's what i know but this is like second hand because i i listen to part of the fda meeting and people have also corresponded with me or send me emails about that so that that's what i know but i think we're moving to a more conservative evaluation of the vaccines uh especially now that that that their decision was was is not going to be made before the election so i think that's going to give everybody sort of a you know breathing space thank you thank you nestor chris there's a question about the i think just about the volume of testing that you're doing at tricor do you have a can you just give us an idea about the volume that you're seeing right now um we're getting um anywhere between 2 000 and 3 500 or so tests per day um and we continue to operate um 24 7 um on multiple platforms um to try to get those results out as quickly as possible thank you very much and um i have a question affordable question for clarissa carla you you're still doing mainly pcr right karissa you're not doing like mass antigen testing or is it's mainly pcr in different platform is that correct that's correct um pcr on multiple platforms manufacturers are in various stages of submitting to the fda for an emergency use authorization for antigen based testing on some of the larger platforms but we really don't have any data right now on the sensitivity or performance of those um kind of big box the same type of platform that would run like a hepatitis b surface antigen right type of test um that that just goes out in in a higher throughput those are not yet approved by the fda and so we're waiting to understand more about those performance and and how they could be used thank you i'm harry sybold would you would you like to answer i mean would you like to ask your question that you put into the chat sure i'll see if i can put it in in a form that's intelligible um for any one of the panelists there there's been some discussion about tactics for especially nursing homes and other types of congregate settings for how to keep them safe and as the prices of some of these antigen tests come down dramatically some people have suggested frequent testing with a lower sensitivity test may actually bring up the uh the effectiveness of that such that it's equal to using a pcr test one or two times uh in that congruent setting in terms of keeping the entire population safe and i've tried to wrap my heads around the statistics of that and i haven't quite been able to to do that and i was wondering what any of you thought about that um so i think it's it's an interesting approach um and it's it truly is just a basic uh probability issue um if even within the best case scenario it looks like these antigen tests are um anywhere between 75 and 85 sensitive when used in the right patient population um so it's you know you've put in uh put into a bag four different uh things and see how often you pull out the right answer i mean it truly is a probability so if you have 85 chance of getting the answer correct one time you can improve your probability either by increasing the sensitivity of the test or performing that same test multiple times um and so that's that's truly just the statistics around it um so i but i think that the challenge is that the sensitivity that i just described is within the patient population as described by um the the package insert for those tests which is patients within anywhere between five and ten days of symptom onset depending on the test um that does not take into sensitivity related to um asymptomatic individuals and so i think the concern within those asymptomatic individuals is that the sensitivity drops dramatically from 75 to 85 percent into you know as low some studies have shown sensitivities in the 20s and i don't know that you can test to at a frequency high enough to be able to overcome a sensitivity that's below 50 um so i think that's one of the challenges and then of course within asymptomatic populations you also run into the challenge of false positives and so there's algorithms for how to address follow-up testing in these patients if you have a patient with symptoms and high likelihood maybe you repeat the negatives if you're testing asymptomatic patients perhaps that's a population in which you would retest the uh positives with a pcr test to be able to confirm um so that would really be the strategy but it takes a lot of coordination between organizations to find a strategy that will work great thank you so much nestor leslie did you have any other comments about that no thank you that was amazing great thank you um i just want to ask one question that was sent in um prior to the the session about how long how long can kobet live on surfaces um i know nestor you talked about this a couple of weeks ago but i don't know if you can just give a little summary yeah well in the latest paper was about the skin it lasts for at least eight to nine hours they were able to show in this japanese experiment that it lasted for for for that time eight to nine hours um in the surface depends on on the surface there are you know materials like stainless steel and glass that it can last for days we are talking several days i've seen four or five days in some of the some of the series and even longer in a few isolated reports in which they have been able to find the virus um you know a couple of weeks after the original contamination presumably and and in in porous materials like paper and cloth the duration is less so we're talking about maybe one day 24 hour around that so so there's that that margin from hours in our human skin to all the way to several days uh maybe up to a week in in in very uh in inert materials like stainless steels or glass that's that's sort of a short review i think the bottom line is watch your hand even if it's not the main transmission mode uh if you're around patients or potential patients that may be contaminating areas i think it's important to to maintain the hygiene and wash your hands thank you very much nestor um i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme uh link went into the chat a couple of minutes ago so please fill that out if you would need to see me and also we'd love to hear your feedback and i'm just going to turn it back over to joanna thanks carla thanks for all these great questions from everybody um just wanted to go back up to dr kohlmeyer's uh question about any um pre coveted clinics or post copic clinics or patients who may be positive with coven 19 or definitely are um dr colemeyer do you want to unmute and ask your question and i think dr bear might be able to kind of respond just so we can there's some chat chatting going on too and thank you dr bear for telling me about your clinic i mean i've had several patients that are just so sick and home alone with maybe somebody helping them and i just feel helpless if i can't send them somewhere short of the er urgent care for you know a spinal tap or just to someone listen to their lungs so i'd really love to establish the covid like clinics that you have in new mexico here in washington specifically in spokane thanks dr colemeyer dr baird do you want to maybe just uh tell everybody a little bit about what you and dr peratta are doing we i know you guys came on to the critical care echo a couple of months ago but just just very briefly sure so i'm deborah bear i'm a family np i'm not not a physician um we uh actually dr prata identified this need and i kind of jumped on board right away that we knew people were getting tested being discharged from the hospital and being told to go through their primary and we were both working in primary care clinics and decided that seems like a horrible idea so we um just put this together so we start with virtual visits most of the time and we bring people in who need a face to face vital signs especially for hypoxia but also we've had prenatal care that was needed we've done newborn visits more to than we ever expected because of asymptomatic testing during labor and delivery and people not really wanting to see a new mom and a new baby and we've had a variety of ages and it's been a really interesting experience to be talking with people um literally from the medevac folks from the navajo nation to our local folks so we try to we've had a variety of patients over these last six and a half months thanks so much debra um might i ask you do you have um patients who you've had um that you're seeing kind of post covered that you that have had to kind of be re-hospitalized or it seems like you have an amazing continuity of care can you talk about that we have had a couple that have had to be re-hospitalized there was one um so we're also participating with the um uh unm on some of the research patients there was one with lymphoma that i actually tested in the at adianax myself and that she's still in the hospital i think she's on her fourth she's on her fifth week in the hospital but i mean there's things you can't prevent so we do our best to try to manage people outpatient because it does seem that that that oxygen support is really crucial and just having someone to talk with and try to troubleshoot some things to help them through this really helps most people so debra i'm just gonna deviate a little bit and just ask and ask anybody who's might be a clinician working in kind of the navajo nation if um you might be able to tell us what's happening in in mckinley county or in the navajo nation right now if there's what's um what's happening in terms of covet and with their clinics or if they might want to chat in chat in that they can speak to that um in the meantime um another question came in that i wanted to ask nestor uh from dr mccree is it true that temperature is no longer a determinate factor for coven 19. i guess there was some thought that when the summer came this was back in march and april when the summer came that you know things would go away and i guess we're definitely not seeing that or or the or the winter for that matter right yeah i think um the the fact that there were so many cases in different places of the world at the same time um and i can speak for the tropics in latin america you know whether the temperature it's like always 90 degrees and they have huge you know peru it's like the case with more mortality in in the world brazil had a huge epidemic in different latitudes because brazil is such a large country so i think yeah i think the conclusion although i haven't seen anything like a pronouncement i think the there's no such a clear cut relationship between temperature weather and and the virus in in general from the epidemiological standpoint although we know that that during the winter time people congregate indoors they close their windows so so there's also sort of a human factor human behavior factor more than than the temperature itself it's actually the the fact that we are going to congregate during the the winter and that increases the risk of respiratory infections and that has been the same for influenza rsb and other respiratory viruses it's like a cyclical thing um that not necessarily in the case of copy may be related to to a strict relationship between ambient temperature but it's the human factor i think thank you nestor um and do we have an update on if influenza rates are steady or perhaps down right now because of mask wearing in certain areas carissa yes so right now we are seeing um you know it's it's pretty early for flu season uh we don't usually start to see flu rates increase until um into december and early january but when we look uh year over year the numbers are low and we're seeing that um across the country so we're hoping that between mask wearing um and the vaccination rates that were discussed earlier that we'll be able to keep our our numbers low when we look at other respiratory viruses though um we normally would be seeing higher levels of rhinoviruses and the common coronaviruses and we are not seeing those numbers um so i'm i'm cautiously optimistic that our overall respiratory virus season will be lower um with all of the masking and social distancing and hand washing that that many of us are observing thank you so much carissa let's keep our fingers crossed on that right um jonas pelage asked a question and i think some of it has been answered by you carissa um but in terms of the i know predominantly you're doing pcr testing but in terms of it has there been any update in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of any of the tests that you're using right now um so you know i think the most the majority of the pcr tests that are being used all have very good sensitivity and specificity um we're not seeing some of the challenges of um specificity that's been observed with some of the rapid tests like the abbott id now has had some challenges with specificity when used in the wrong patient population and of course the antigen test has the issues with sensitivity that's been described before um so right now um the the method of choice for diagnostics in the largest range of patients um is the pcr um and i think we're all feeling um fairly confident with that um i think there there can be questions about you know later in disease for monitoring um the use of the pcr but right now for diagnosis the the method of choice in the gold standard is pcr thank you carissa um and i just wanted to let everybody know that um in terms of some clinicians from uh the gallup and uh navajo area maria bruckner responded thank you maria dr bruckner that she's a cardiologist she's um that they had recently scaled up their elective work um but they're in a readiness mode to postpone all of those changes as they anticipate an acceleration of cases um and then dr gonzaga from internal medicine um uh well dr gonzaga do you want to unmute and let us know what's going on in your clinic if you're able hi um thanks for having me did you do you hear me uh yes we can hear you a little better now yes uh-huh yeah so we're doing you know 50 face-to-face and 50 telehealth and we still getting a lot of cases in fact um over the weekend or over the week we have 10 new cases in the hospital that have to approve for rem deservier rolling up some of them are coming from the nearby ihs that had been in full capacity um and but we're planning overall to uh have an outpatient for covid just for fun with the rest of the other providers who are um are interested to follow through with these cases that we have so but uh thank you for nestor and everyone else you know for carla and dr kazman for having this uh week by week i you know i enjoy the interactions and uh thank you for all the inputs even from the department of health and every other people that we've learned from each other thank you thank you nestor do you want to comment or talk to dr gonzaga about anything no no i just no my pleasure i was i i saw part of the question there's maria put in the at the end of his question about the overlap of uh native american navajo and and the other tele i don't really know i don't really know i'm gonna look it up and see if there's any any significant gene in flow from the paper that i reviewed the americas were not uh it was not very freaking but that was uh sort of a mixed population in the americas they didn't specify native americans or or any specific ethnic group it was just america's europe asia and and interestingly enough in in in the orient in china the there's not too much of these uh the argentine peace i mean but this is this haplotype that is not present there um but but i don't know in native american i would have to look it up to see if there's any any significant presence of that 50 kilo base haplotype in in our native population thank you so much nestor i'm just um looking at some of the actually i'm looking at the time is what i'm doing and it's the top of the hour this hour went so fast and um i wanted to wish everyone a a good week and to stay safe tomorrow and the rest of the week and for the for keep using your physical distancing and masks and your hand washing and we look forward to seeing you all next week and keep on bringing the pre-registration questions um and all your participation we greatly appreciate and we're so grateful to dr sosa and to dr hayes and to dr culbreth and marla seavers and all of you especially so thank you and be well oh you,,11/2/2020
26,everyone welcome to infectious diseases the covenant 19 office hours are really happy to see everybody today um if you have a camera we would ask that you turn it on if you can we really like to see people's faces and feel like that helps us build community so we would love to see your face if you can if you can turn your camera on um during the session please enter any questions that you have into the chat box and we would actually ask you to refrain from answering other people's questions in the chat box because those we just want uh questions that are meant for the hub team in the in the chat box um if you have any um any technical difficulty you can actually chat our it person on the chat box as well so um again very happy to see everybody um my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician and faculty here at the university of new mexico and one of the associate directors of project echo and i want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman joanna you want to mutant introduce yourself here hi there joanna katzman i'm a neurologist i work at project echo and the unm pain center welcome thank you joanna and um i think i'll just introduce the other hub team members as we go along um i first want to introduce dr nester sosa who's the chief of our infectious diseases division and is going to give us an update on um usually very interesting things going on around covid go ahead thank you thank you carla and joanna welcome everybody it's a pleasure for me to be here today let me share my screen okay can you all see the screen the large good okay thank you okay so we'll start the the reviews actually i have to confess that i i finished uh during the weekend the my presentation and then this morning i woke up with this news that i wanted to share with you i think it's a very good news pfizer announced um early data that shows a vaccine efficacy of 90 obviously this is a very preliminary communication from the leadership of pfizer but apparently they they they look into the into the data just to to remind everybody they have uh they they have a a mrna vaccine a messenger rna vaccine that uses two doses more than 40 000 participants and and what they announced is that they have observed 94 events meaning 94 copy 19 infections among the participants and um and when they look at the the data safety monitoring look at the 94 events less than 10 percent were in patients who received the active vaccine and obviously more than 90 were on those who received the placebo so that that's what they um they they reached this preliminary conclusion that the apparent efficacy of the vaccine is 90 so far obviously they need to wait for more time um and actually the the number that they are aiming for before uh um stopping the the trial is 164 events so there's still you know like 70 events 70 more cases of kobe among the participants who actually uh have an entering a formal interim analysis but they they anyway communicated this based on the on the report of their analysis board uh and obviously everybody uh in the media and and the dow jones and everything start moving in reaction to these these good news but i think we have to be cautious uh we still have more time to wait for these 164 events uh we don't know how long the protection this these are patients that have just completed the two doses of vaccinations so we haven't really uh that much time since they finished the the second dose and obviously we need to wait for the publication to take a look at the safety profile etc but you know definitely you know with so many bad news in the in the coming pandemic this is one one thing that it's really uh good and just for comparison the efficacy the efficacy of of other vaccines like uh influenza and other vaccines are much less we're talking 60 70 percent efficacy so really an efficacy of 90 or over 90 it's close to the ones we see with some uh like missiles vaccines and other very effective childhood vaccinations so so if this is true if if it's really 90 uh without any red flags it's really something that can be used to to curtail the pandemic once we have enough doses and enough people are vaccinated and this is the same platform as moderna so so that's also important to to point out okay so let's let's do the that was sort of the the latest news that i introduced there into the presentation so this this other paper that i that i'm going to mention i'm just going to mention one a very uh small aspect of this paper uh but i i was really really impressed by this finding and this may be the first time that we actually start to understand why some patients get this prolonged copy let me let me share with you the list this is a paper that's actually in pre-publication in which the really the authors were analyzing the the safety uh i'm sorry not the safety the immunity of um of people who who got kobe 19 so they were measuring the antibodies and neutralizing antibodies and they found that apparently the immunity continues to evolve over the first three to six months of the infection almost as if uh there were some uh live virus in in the body of these patients uh from what they what they uh read from the from the evolution of the antibody response etc so they decided that they took 87 patients to do this study and they they got the antibody levels and the neutralizing that we have presented similar data before and you can see how they tend to to decrease with time but the most amazing thing is that they took 14 of these patients that had survived or recovered from kobe they were completely asymptomatic they were three months out of their acute disease and they did an endoscopy and took biopsies of the helium and also biopsies of the duodenum so they did intestinal biopsies just to see if there was any virus present because we know that you know there are some patients that excrete virus or at least rna of the virus in the stools for a prolonged period of time we have in fact commented on that on these on these meetings and the amazing thing is that they were able to find using different technologies they were able to find what looks like uh complete viral particles in the tissues of this patient and let me show you the four of the photos first of all they did immunofluorescence so anything that is and this is this is a cut of the intestine these are the the intestinal v lies um and the cells and anything that stains green in these this in this picture it's uh it's viral proteins or viral rna depending on the technique so so they first proved that there was at least viral material a lot of viral material present in these cells and just to remind everybody these are asymptomatic patients three months out of their acute infection but what impresses me the most and you know we know that rna can linger so so you can make an argument well this this is like you know incomplete virions or this is remnants of of rna but look at this following photo so this is the luminal intestine this is the duodenum so they they did a closer look using electro microscope and you can start to see within these uh structures you can start to see something like looks like round and has some spikes and when you do magnification in fact these structures are very or highly subjective of actual intact billions so so this is the first evidence of at least uh three months out of persistent uh viral presence in the gi tract in the immune uh germinal centers of the of the gi tract on this seven out of 14 people that they biopsy so 50 of the patient that they biopsy um had these these uh structures here and also had rna and also had viral proteins so so their their interpretation is that in fact there is persistence of virus in these uh in at least in these patients for for a prolonged period of time we're talking three months and this is the ilion of these patients similar finding you can see the structures here in less magnification and when you go deeper you can see there's something that it doesn't look like a like an organelle like a normal cellular organelle and it looks more like like a virulent with uh spike projections the spike protein that that actually gives the typical appearance to these uh to this coronavirus family so so that's that's one of the papers i think we have to wait for this paper to be published and you know be critiqued by people who are experts on electron microscopy but it's very highly suggestive of persistent uh viral in asymptomatic patients so that's that's really uh i thought it was an amazing finding the other the other um uh paper that it's gonna come out come out and actually this is sort of a preliminary communication that one of the author which is which is a famous physician in the northeast daniel griffin he actually has a a nice podcast um in which he reviews every week the the latest news on on um and it's called this week in biology but he he in one of the podcasts he said that they submitted a paper to the analysts of internal medicine uh with 30 experts from all over the world in which they actually are trying to come up with like more um sort of a consensus on the faces of of copy 19 so i thought it was interesting so so we have obviously the incubation period the so-called viral viral symptom phase which is when there's like a lot of viral replication and then the inflammatory phase and the most interesting thing is that that based on on their discussion of these uh paper is that we really have to understand the treatment in these phases because early on on you know either very early when you are able to detect the virus in the asymptomatic or presymptomatic or really early symptomatic time is when you have to use the monoclonal the anti-antivirals and maybe the interference later in the course of the disease the antibiotics are ineffective and we have seen this with with rendessive with some of the other drugs that have been tested when you use it too late in patients water in mechanical ventilation there's no no benefit and in fact this is the moment for like dexamethasone and other immune modulators the anticoagulation that we've been using in this patient and they also make an argument that especially when you use dexamethasone um at some point patients may have secondary infections so it's between this second and third week that we should be on the look for for secondary bacterial and fungal infections in these cobia patients and obviously the the the tail end is the lung copied uh which is like the latter part of these uh of these uh staining of hiv so i thought it was interesting it looks very complicated but it sort of puts everything in in in order and actually they they point out to some specific moments in the disease like the exposure that when the viral replication is detectable detectable when the patient starts symptoms so they have all this time time for symptoms early inflammation secondary infection hyperinflammatory syndrome for some patients that get the the so-called cytokine storm and that's a nomenclature that they're going to be using or at least promoting with this paper enamels so we all speak the same language and then at the same time there was an interesting paper in the new england journal that i also recommend it's obviously a review uh by gandhi lynch and dr carlos de rio um about bile to moderate kobe and very similarly they publish a very i think it's it's a less complicated graph but it has the same thing they actually divide the disease in bioreplication phase and inflammation and and they also position the therapies as we have discussed antiviral therapy really early and then an antibody therapy also early if you want to use monoclonal or convalescent plasma you have to use it early in the disease and then the second part the really the anti-inflammatory or amino modulatory therapies in the second um you know when you have more severe critical illness and science or laboratory manifestation of inflammation so but this is a very very thorough review paper that i i recommend uh you know reading for mild to moderate kobe the other i i think i explained a few days ago we discussed uh how the the you know people have been able to associate problems with the interferon signaling pathway and severe copy and i found this illustration because i i saw myself uh explaining this complicated basic science um and i i ran into this really simple um illustration of this relationship between between having issues with the interference and being predisposed to severe coping and this is what the these graphs chose so there are two mechanisms basically um you can either have an in uh like an inborn error or of the of the pathway of any of the proteins of the pathway of interference so any of these red dots in any of these intermediate proteins which are part of the pathway to interferon activation will render you more susceptible to severe severe copy and the other mechanism which is actually more common is the production of auto antibodies if if you if you have auto antibodies that actually neutralize or fix the interference then you're not going to have the antibiotic efficacy of interference so either way either if you have an inherited um error of of your interferom uh intermediate proteins or you have are circulating um mono non-monochromatory and antibodies auto antibodies that neutralize interference you're going to have more susceptibility to severe copy and that's what we explain and and from that paper that we review a couple of weeks ago it was up to 14 of patients who have severe disease can be explained by either of these phenomena either had a hereditary uh error uh in the interferon pathway signaling proteins or they just have circulating uh auto antibodies that attack the their own interference and doesn't allow them to have a normal innate response to the virus and thus get a more severe um clinical course and finally just to finish two nice uh papers review papers that i recommend dr del rio also wrote in jama this uh sort of a summary of what we know of long term health consequences of kobe really very succinct like a couple of pages long so for those who are really busy and don't want to read a lot of basic science stuff this actually summarizes the cardiac finding the lung finding the symptoms the neurologic findings that have been associated with the so-called long-covered or post-acute copy so i highly recommend it and as i said it's very very short and sweet and very very well summarized and they they have also the mayo clinic has also published this systematic review and a rapid guidance on how to use anti-coagulation and this is a much more lengthy lengthy a paper they actually go into all the publications on on the risk for for thrombosis what evidence do we have it's essentially a very very thorough revision of the of the topic of anticoagulation but at the end of the paper they come up with like a like an algorithm when to use and how to use anticoagulation i'm gonna not gonna go into digital but obviously describe different patient situation if they have certain risk factors for for having these um thrombosis or not and they go into this algorithm and then finally they end up recommending the different regimens of uh um either an ox and oxiparin or or in fractional heparin depending on on the risk factors and and and the renal function and these two two slides just summarize this algorithm for those who actually manage our patients with with coping in the hospital i thought it was very useful and this is what they're using in the mayo mayo clinic based on their on their systematic review so i think that's it and and before i heard about the about the the pfizer vaccine i was going to communicate two news but i think they're already secondary there was this news of the discovery of a copy mutation in minks in a in a farm in denmark and they had to kill 17 million minks that they used for for their fur because apparently the these animals these mammals were infected with what they think it's a it's a virus that has a mutation that may render some of the vaccines ineffective but this was a press communication but it was sort of uh sorry made a lot of noise and the other the other significant news was that the fda gave emergency authorization to uh to a test to detect neutralizing antibodies which is something that we we really need to to to determine who's who's a good donor for for convalescent plasma for instance so we will see this if this becomes more uh you know commercially available and the availability of or or being available to measure really people who have neutralizing antibodies and to see if they have been infected or post vaccination if if several months after vaccination they still have uh neutralizing antibodies so so i think it's going to be a useful test in certain in the right situation um and it has received fda approval so i think that was my last slide let me stop share sharing thank you joanna and carla thank you nestor for that really excellent update and very exciting news i'm going to go ahead and move on to before we get into questions we're going to have the updates first so i'm going to go ahead and move to leslie hayes leslie if you can just introduce yourself and and share your presentation thank you leslie hayes and um elena could you let me screen share it's not letting me screen share yes i will all right ahead all right can everybody see this can everybody hear me yes we can great yes so i was going to start just um i had a couple articles pop up this week on things that people are taking to prevent um bad cobia 19 and i'm going to tell you i have yet to see any actual studies of people taking them to prevent them and seeing if that works so um they're really just these are more inpatient studies of medications that people have been trying to use in the outpatient world so i don't know if it's applicable or not but i just thought it was kind of interesting so first thing please don't hold the hoard the femunidine i've had significant trouble getting this medication from my patients and i've had to put many on ppi's which are much riskier medications long term so this particular study they took um seven thousand one hundred and fifty eight patients with covid and um they looked at whether or not they got covered within first 24 hours of their hospital admin and regardless of how it was given or the route and they looked at 30-day all-cause mortality and um so they initially found that 15 of patients with um uh kobit were exposed to the modidine and 84 percent were not and then they did something that i've never heard of before but which i assume is a statistical thing um course and exact matching they found that um they matched people with people who were similar to them and they ended up with 1100 patients with that and 410 or 35 were exposed and 746 or 64 were not exposed you may went away the cheese to unfreeze okay and then um they found that nine point six percent of uh patients in the pre-match cohort in 11.5 percent in the post-match cohort died um and the pre-match 30-day mortality was 18 percent for from monitoring users and eight percent for non-commodity users um probability of 0.007 and um so once they actually like went through and looked at how sick people had begun to been to begin with because famotidine was given more often to the sick people they found there was not a difference between a hospital from auditing and the 30-day mortality and so if people could at least stop recommending it until we have better data because it doesn't look like for sure it didn't help it may have made things worse vitamin d maybe and when i went to look this up i found one article and i started looking up other and there's a lot of really articles and really bad journals and i tried not to do those but these these ones were kind of interesting so this one they took 76 patients hospitalized with covid19 and acute respiratory infection and i couldn't find when they had actually done this i'm hoping it was quite some time ago because everybody got hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin this was in spain and then they were allocated two patients to get calcifidiol which is a metabolite of vitamin d or to every one patient who did not get it and then of the 50 patients treated with the calcifidiol one required admission to the icu all of the 26 untreated patients 13 required admission so 2 versus 50 probability less than 0.001 and ratio for icu um was .02 and um uh oops hang on um of the patients treated with calcified dial none died all were discharged without complications the 13 patients not treated with calcifidiol who were not admitted to the icu were discharged of those who were admitted to the icu two died and the remaining 11 were discharged so that one actually looked kind of hopeful and then a second one where they looked at vitamin d levels in patients who were hospitalized basically to 216 cobin 19 patients compared to 197 population based controls of the 216 patients 19 were on vitamin d supplements and were analyzed separately and i got to say this was kind of a confusing paper i thought they looked at way too many variables but basically what they found was that the vitamin d levels were much lower in um people who were hospitalized than in the controls and we don't know cause and effect on this it could be somehow that cobot causes your vitamin d levels to drop it could be that low vitamin d was associated with hypertension and cardiovascular which obviously is going to make people more likely to be hospitalized um but it did seem that the people who had higher vitamin d levels were doing better so and they finished by saying there was not a causal relationship found between vitamin d deficiency and coping 19 severity so we don't know just kind of an interesting thought though but this one looks definitely more promising than the famotadine um obesity is a significant risk factor for bad outcomes this particular study the association of body mass index and other metabolic risk factors with pneumonia outcomes in the landsat they looked at 1461 covet 19 patients admitted to intensive care units in europe israel and the u.s between february and may 1080 required uh intermittent mechanical ventilation the 28 day mortality rate was 36 percent and there was a significant relationship between bmi and the need for ventilation odds ratio of 1.27 for every five that your bmi went up and 1.65 although this one did not reach statistical significance for every five in women under the age of 50. and there was also a significant association between bmi and mortality um that was really only um increased if your bmi was over 40. however unfortunately people are just struggling with weight during the lockdown and these were this article looked at two studies that were presented at the obesity society's annual meeting i couldn't find the studies actually published anywhere one was by jamie elmondez who is the medical director of the ut southwestern medical center's weight wellness program and they just surveyed 123 patients who came to their clinic and then i'm not going to try and pronounce this other name who but this person is the research program coordinator in the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at johns hopkins university and they did an online survey of 439 people in lockdown states and this particular one i think they were actually peering into my windows they found that 84 of patients surveyed had increased feelings of depression 73 reported more anxiety during lockdown 61 of they were stress eating half reported they were stockpiling food and they half also said they weren't exercising as much the second study they found that folks were binge watching much more than normal during the lockdown the folks who binge watch doubled from 14 percent pre-lockdown to 32 during lockdown the percentage of folks who binge watch it all increased from 59 pre-locked down to 72 during the lockdown the hours spent binge watching increased from 3.3 to nearly 4 hours a day and unfortunately people with a higher bmi tended to report higher levels of stress and high levels of stress though drove them to spend more time watching television so we do know that weight is a significant factor for covid but don't just tell patients to lose weight pretty much the vast majority of people who overweight already want to lose weight and are struggling with it so looking at this we we want to focus more on their anxiety we want to focus on how do we help them eat healthier how do we help them find ways to exercise you'll look at the actual things that are going on what can we do to help them so that they're doing other activities instead of binge watching and i think these are really important and oh stress also does stacking during binge watching about 46 of people under high stress often are always weight while they were binge watching compared with 25 reporting medium stress and 21 of those with low stress so so helping them to deal with stress i think is also very important but don't just focus on weight because it's not very successful it's about like telling your patient with hypoxia just taking more oxygen it just it's not going to work you need to look at some of these underlying causes and then this was an interesting article especially um given what dr sosa was just talking about with the um first study on the pfizer vaccine so the these um this study they looked at 1971 people and they had them do a survey about potential covid vaccines and not surprisingly they found if the efficacy increased from 50 to 90 percent people were more willing to take it went from point five to point six longer protection duration people went from point five five to point five seven which really is not that significant decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects was associated with a four percent increase from 54 to 58 percent um decreasing the incidence of minor um side effects was increased from 55 to 57. um fda eua was associated with less willingness to do it but again not a huge um significance 55 to 57 percent interestingly this one had the highest um increase of any people were much more willing to take a vaccine made in the u.s 60 were willing to take a vaccine made in the u.s 58 if it was made in the uk only 50 for a vaccine made in china um and it also varied depending on who recommended it 52 were willing to take a vaccine recommended by president trump 55 if it was recommended by vice president biden um cdc recommendation put it up to 59 world health organization 58 and what's important i think about all of these is these numbers are still not great i mean we're not going to get good herd immunity if we only have um 50 of the population vaccinated and even on the highest one was only 60 so i think we need to start talking to our patients about why uh covet vaccine is a good thing and you know why we trust the fda to do a good job with it it does seem like emergency youth emergency use emergency use authorization is not necessarily going to be a good strategy for getting people to take it and then just some other interesting articles vivek murthy was surgeon general under dr obama and abraham vergasi has written several wonderful medical novels or two of my absolute medical heroes and they have a podcast that they did um about loneliness during covet and it was just i've listened to part of it it's excellent so everyone gets lonely here's how to counter it and it's well worth listening to and i have not actually watched this ucf grand rounds but the people talking um are good and ucsf grand rounds have been excellent on this but the implications of the election on the future of the pandemic and then um article about dr burks saying that we really need to be taking this more seriously and then going back to the nasal spray from last week apparently um i forget where this one was it was from somewhere i believe in new york but um they actually um have done some studies on the nasal spray in ferrets and they found that it helped to prevent the ferrets from getting covered so next they're going to move forward to working with people and i'm actually really excited about this nasal spray because it's over the counter they expect it to be cheap but they expect it to be readily available so and it seems if we could get this uh out it might really be promising so and that was all i had thank you very much leslie thank you that's excellent um i wanted just to go to carissa colbraith and chris can you introduce yourself and i don't know if you have any updates but i just wanted everyone to know who you are and that you're here today she was here maybe she's not here hi carissa no okay um so i think i'm going to turn it actually back over to joanna to start with the questions thank you for those excellent presentations and i will check and see if carissa is is there a chat with her joanna are you ready yes i am ready thank you carla thank you dr hayes thank you dr sosa and thank you pfizer um it is a good day today um so i just wanted to um start with uh some of the initial questions um dr sosa can you um speak to i think dr ramer's um kind of talked about this a little bit but i'm wondering if you could maybe maybe if you or dr ramers might be able to talk about um you know the pfizer study and how they were originally um uh analyzing the cases and then um going up and kind of uh and how they were um i'm trying to look at the first question um oh dr uh i think dr seibold and dr ramers were talking in the chat and uh dr uh ramers uh was saying that this is actually many more patients than were originally planned in the first interim analysis dr ramers do you want to kind of talk about that sure and i'll start by saying we don't really know a lot yet we just have this new york times article and the press release so you know it's always nice to get the it's it's nice to get the initial news but of course that may be spun in a certain way by the company we need to see the actual data and we don't know a lot of details that i'm interested in seeing like how many infections occurred in the placebo versus the um those who received the vaccine and then also are we talking infections as an endpoint or severe infections as an endpoint that's a very very important distinction but having said that you know each of these protocols and one of the cool things about transparency is is all the major companies have released their protocols so you can actually just see them yourselves um the interim analyses are planned when statistically you can actually see a difference and they're planned at really relatively low um sorry carl i'll introduce myself i'm christian raymour's an id doctor from san diego and i see linda gorgos good to see you i did fellowship with linda um so these interim analyses are planned at points where you may be able to see statistical differences in the two groups and it really only takes a handful um to show that especially if all of them occur in the placebo and none of them occur in the vaccine recipients the the original plan that i just read from the new york times article was that pfizer was going to do their first interim analysis at only 32 cases and fda said that's a little bit too few we should go more than that up to maybe 64. and they said fine and by the time they went back and tried to cut the data they were already up above 90. the ultimate endpoint i think was only going to be at about 164. so so there's a difference between doing interim analyses for efficacy and continuing to follow uh what happens to these participants and most of the protocols that i've read really want to follow patients out to two years um and and i've mentioned in another chat comment here that it's one of the major concerns at this fda advisory meeting in october was that these companies need to be allowed to finish the trials because you know there may be safety events much later on there may be antibody mediated enhancement which is a big fear everybody has from the dengue story and that really is going to take these trials to be allowed to continue um one just a personal note is i'm not sure i mean of course every everybody that's in a clinical trial will be allowed to withdraw if they want to but what if you enroll in a clinical trial and then a different vaccine becomes available and you're eligible for that that might be an interesting dilemma that we might have but anyway a lot a lot more information to come and this this analysis was planned so we'll wait to see the data thank you so much dr ramers and sorry that i did not introduce you thank you um dr salsa anything more to add to that no absolutely and they actually commented in the in one of the press release that they're the sort of the next analysis will be with when they have 164 and they were pretty optimistic that you know given the number of cases that we have in some of the sites where this vaccine is being tested it's not going to take a long time to get those 164 um so so we'll see and definitely i agree with with with christian and we have talked to about this in other in other echo sessions that that um you know for me it's also important to see the duration of the protection because this is a very really short term protection you know patients who have been vaccinated um got less less coffee than those who had received the vaccine uh or they were the placebo i'm sorry but but we don't really know what's gonna happen in three months or four months under down the road if this patient i'm going to get infections or not those also those who receive the active vaccine so that's why i think it's very important uh you know together with having safety data having some long-term data to really you know be able to understand and actually plan around a sound uh vaccination strategy do we need to do like boosters every six months or every year of these mrna vaccines so it's important to to continue the trial even if they if they decide to just go ahead and and uh and get some type of approval the story has to continue so i i do agree with uh with christian right that makes total sense to even if the fda does approve it to continue the study for the full two-year period to get safety and long-term efficacy data thank you thank you both um a question from caleb howard is when would the pfizer covered vaccination potentially be approved by the fda so nestor i'll let you take that first is there an estimated date of approval do you know what's at the top not really and in fact what christian said is that in the last meeting and this is something that the scientists have been sort of pushing that these companies should not look for the the e-way so so actually look for a more full-blown approval um so an eua can come as you know as soon as a couple of months if they present the data and the fda goes along with it but i think there's a lot of um you know criticism that that's not the right way to go that it's better to have a a definitive uh approval or a biological approval um instead of just a you know an emergency authorization but we'll see i i it's very hard they said that they're going to have uh by the end of the year they can have 20 million doses ready for like healthcare workers nursing home workers and things so i wouldn't be surprised if they receive an eua that that some of us in this group are actually offer this or or one of the other vaccines that are that we're going to have the results really soon and the and the application to the fda really soon but we have to wait i mean but i think it's a matter of a few months at the most uh before we start seeing uh something at least on the market or or at least by the government you know bought by the federal government right good workers i guess that leads me to the next the next question from uh uh modlina um once the vaccine um is for use what is the interval is does is pfizer is the pfizer study a two dose vaccination and if so what is the interval between the two doses yes uh except for for johnson or johnson johnson all of the other vaccines that are further advanced are two doses and they usually separate either by 21 or 28 days i don't recall i don't know if christian knows if this this is 21 or 28 but that's usually the time they they usually give to those separate by three or four weeks um except for the one that j and j are it's it's advancing which is a single dose vaccination yeah it's 21 days for the pfizer protocol and i put i put actually a link to the protocol um in the chat as well uh keep in mind this is one that requires a minus 70 degree deep freeze so the logistics of how to make that happen are going to be very difficult um in terms of the training you know i think people are going to have to essentially register as cova vaccine sites if if we're going to do that and it's going to have to be very strictly controlled one other thing i just wanted to mention joanna if it's okay um this weekend idsa and cdc have a presentation every saturday at noon noon my time i should say and they spent the whole time on um on vaccines this last weekend and somebody i think from the cdc was able to present all of the different phase four work that's going on now so this doesn't just end with emergency use authorization there's going to be a lot of safety data collected as this has rolled out so they have the vares the vaccine adverse event response system and they have two or three other systems in place and they even developed a brand new one which is just specifically dedicated towards covid so we obviously need additional safety data once these get their emergency authorization whatever form that takes thank you so much christian thank you i also wanted to let everybody know that um this the nestor slides are um in the chat from several minutes ago in in uh in a couple of minutes the cme link will be in the chat as well uh a question from maria christina garcia llano is has any research um as to the as to the uh the fecal the the virus in the feces uh uh been known in terms of a correlation with um people with covet who are having uh gi symptoms has there been a correlation with um that and persistence of the virus and the sewage system um maybe this is a question for marla and i think marla stevers is not here with us today but didn't know if nestor if you've seen any studies looking at kind of covet gi symptoms with maybe the pooled uh you know sewage the pulled virus in the sewage right no i haven't i actually have not seen a publication combining two i've seen it separate as i know that very early in the pandemic gi symptoms were you know less common than the usual you know shortness of breath cough and fever but but a significant percentage of patients do experience diarrhea or and other gi complaints so i've seen that in and that's have been really throughout the study in fact i think the kids usually have a lot more gi symptoms also it's not uncommon for the kids to have gi symptoms more than respiratory when they're symptomatic um and i have seen the other uh you know fact and actually there was recently there was this um a systematic review of of viral excretion and i think i shared it in one of the previous session in which they found that that you can find the rna of the virus in the feces for a long time almost as as long as you find them in the np swaps so it's definitely documented excretion and obviously these will go into the sewage system and and can be detected um and and used as a surveillance uh and in fact there's a whole science called uh wastewater epidemiology in which people are are analyzing how to use this this positive uh sewage water test uh to to analyze how the how to predict an epidemic in a community or in a congregate living facility uh so so yeah but but i haven't really seen like this correlation if you have like a high wire load in the thesis that means that you have more diarrhea or vice versa i haven't seen that direct correlation thanks nestor um back to you carla thanks joanna um there are a couple of questions in the chat about the the nasal spray i don't know leslie if you want to if you can unmute yourself and talk a little bit more about the specific or what is in the nasal spray it's a lipopeptide which is from what i understand is like cholesterol with um cholesterol-based with the protein on it um but uh i don't know anything more about it there hasn't been anything specific on what exactly it is and as far as i know it's proprietary molecule still at this point but um it is newly developed it is um the folks at new mexico tech i think we're working on one for fungi or bacteria and they actually altered it um and i don't know if this is the same one that they just um experimented on the ferrets with but i did wish they could have used it on the mink rather than having to kill those 17 million mink that's interesting yeah the only one comment uh joanna and carla on this the only thing that worries me about the nasal spray is the protection of the eyes and the mouth i mean they're people who are mouth breeders so it would probably you know confer some degree of protection but i i mean my bias i haven't seen the data or anything it's that there's always a risk of other mucosal surfaces like the eyes and the mouth uh to be to be the portal of entries so it would be interesting to see how protective it is in humans because we we probably have slightly different physiology to the ferrets uh when regards to breathing so it will be interesting thank you nestor um there was unfortunately karissa had to get off but there's a good question by her she she asked any evidence that the anti-interferon therapeutics have the same impact as interferon auto antibodies nestor do you know no i haven't seen i haven't seen anything and just to recap the interference actually i i saw a paper that that because we're using interference we're doing right now we're participating in the ac3 trial so we're using interference i think by my uh reading of of the of the pathophysiology is that early on in the disease interferon may be effective because it's it's demonstrated that that defect in the in the innate immunity when you have either the the inborn errors of the of the signaling pathway or oral antibodies it will predispose you to to complicated uh copied or severe copy but but there are some evidence that if you give the interference too late it may not be beneficial and in fact maybe deleterious because there's small information so so if you use it like in the inflammatory phase interferon can give you more more inflammation you know as actually one of the side effects of getting interfering is that feeling that you have like a like a flu or or an infection because there is release of other other um cytokines as part of the inflammatory reaction so but i haven't seen anything about like you know something that interferes with that with interference um as part of the therapy or or or complicating the clinical course i haven't read of that just to add this is leslie there was an article in the new york times i believe yesterday about cytokines storms and um that it they're rethinking it it was actually fairly well written and easy to understand people might want to look that up thank you and harry seybold you also asked a question about interferon do you want to ask that question i'm i'm not sure go ahead i want you to ask it i'm sure just listening to uh what dr sosa said about that study what what are the risk factors that a patient has a a interferon deficiency or a low interferon level i don't i'm not a oncologist and that i'm not sure i follow that exactly yeah well what i saw in these papers is they actually look at severe cases and this is how they detected this so they they had a you know a large group of patients with severe disease and they measure auto antibodies against interference and they measure um genetic markers or or look at the pathway and they found these sort of signals in the you know deficiencies in the in the signaling pathway or the other antibodies but there was no evidence of pre-existing disease on this patient so these were not like immunosuppressed or anything it was just regular patients who unknowingly had either an inborn error of metabolism or auto antibodies and then they go ahead and develop copied and live really poorly and there was this famous case in in i think it was in in holland in which they analyzed young people with with severe covet and they found in two different families also hereditary errors uh related to to co to uh to deficiencies in the interference and in fact one was actually a white caucasian family from holland and the other one was from a african descent descent so they were not related but both had um you know significant uh loss of function of interfering proteins uh as an inborn error but they were completely healthy until they got copied and developed severe covey so so i think it's an interesting finding but i think we still have to see more more of that christian were you going to say something you look like no okay um uh there's a very interesting question from dan saltman about um the mrna vaccines i don't know dan if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question uh sure thank you it was kind of a about uh a safety question about the how the mrna vaccines work into into which human cells is the mrna taken up and in order to produce the antibody and is there any evidence for incorporation of that mrna gene into the human genome and just in a general way what are the theoretical uh long-term risks of mrna vaccines since they're kind of unknown it's an unknown quantity still thank you oh those are tough questions but i'll tell you what i know because i participated in an nih trial with dna vaccine which is very similar it was a zika dna vaccine and we discussed the way it should work and actually the the principal investigator uh explained to us to the to the local investigator how they they think it works first of all the cell seems to be the muscle cell because they actually inject it in the arm or the gluteal area so the the infected cell with this mrna are mostly uh muscle cells just muscle and and the mrna is translated into proteins in in the in the cytoplasm of these cells and and then the protein is the one that actually produces the immune response so that usually this mrna synthetize apart or the whole spike protein and then when the body sees that protein starts producing antibodies and and a thistle response to these uh foreign protein that have been locally uh manufactured by the by the mrna and the ribosomal uh you know system of the of the human uh cells uh the the likelihood of this being incorporated into dna it's very difficult because that only happens when there is like reverse transcriptase activity it happens with hiv hiv is it's an rna virus and with hep c that karla can help me with that there is reverse transcription so some of the dna can be converted into into dna and can go into the nucleus and be integrated but this mrna um doesn't go with with a reverse transcription because we don't have reverse transcriptase in our cells so presumably it shouldn't happen i mean we should not uh convert this mrna into dna and and be integrated into the human genome it's just you know destroyed by the rna aces that are in the cells and and and presumably this mrna after some time it should disintegrate uh and not be incorporated into anything but that that's that's the thought behind using mrna that it's not going to be incorporated because there's no reverse transcriptase um in the in the cell and i'm just thinking about what happened for an hiv patient that is vaccinated that has a co-infection with with hiv and and has some reverse transcriptions i don't know i don't think they have that have been discussed before but it shouldn't happen in a normal human cell because there's no reverse transcript space to to catalyze that that reaction from mrna to dna i don't know if yeah thank you i just um you know um uh brad hale is on who's one of our new infectious diseases attendings who just started so um do you want to unmute yourself and just uh talk about your comments uh sure hi everybody um yeah just joining the division here now i had some um uh initial work with uh was an rna vaccine and malaria and um right like nestor says they they are usually given im but they can be given intradermally and uh they are incorporated locally by the cells that are exposed usually there's a lipid vehicle because otherwise the mrna is degraded super rapidly and in fact if it gets accidentally injected iv it's annihilated um our own endogenous uh endonucleases just disintegrate the virus um so they they're in the cytoplasm of these cells that they're exposed to and then um based on the construct you can have some auto-replication of the mrna gene of interest that you're creating these proteins that are then expressed and create your effect usually they don't have a durable effect and that was the problem that we had we had a pretty weak response to our vaccine but vaccine technology has improved a lot in the past 10 years and that's how long it's been a little longer in fact since we tried our malaria vaccine um so the expression and the subsequent immunity has improved a lot uh but they they're much safer than dna vaccines i think um or at least theoretically safer because uh like nestor said they're absolutely not incorporated into the genome thank you very much that's excellent i just wanted to let everybody know that the um the the link for the cme and the evaluation went into the chat about five or ten minutes ago so we would love to hear from you and um if if you need to see me you need to fill that out to get cme i'm gonna ask one more question i know this is a really big question so this may be the last question but several people have asked what if anybody knows why the worst you know the pandemic is getting so bad everywhere in the world in the u.s and all over the world and i don't know i know that nobody knows exactly that answer but if maybe we'd like to hear your your thoughts about it we'll start with you nestor that's a good question i mean i think uh i would say based on the on the evidence that we have that by you know removing people from social contact using universal masking closing bars closing restaurants we have seen how that works curtailing the epidemic it happening in all of the all of the east uh uh you know the china and singapore and taiwan and et cetera they were able to really curtail the epidemic and then europe was able to to at least decrease the first wave so i would say is lack of there of all of those interventions i mean the fact that we um open restaurants bars the economy open again people start moving a lot of people went back to work et cetera that increased the contact between people and and simply spread the disease and spread the viruses i think it's just uh the fact that we essentially stopped doing uh the lockdown and all of the other public health measures that we have discussed were relaxed so so we saw the the case going gone up again um so that that's i think that's my explanation there's no evidence except for the d614g mutation which increases transmissibility a little bit there's really not enough data to think that the virus is mutating you know rapidly or or it's completely different to the virus that was circulating in in march which would be an alternative explanation but just a viral phenomenon as opposed to a human phenomenon but i think it's mostly a human phenomenon may be helped by the by the fact that the weather is going is cooler and people are going indoors et cetera that that's my my sort of my guess based on what i have read thank you nestor joanna um any any last questions that you um maybe i'll just uh take this opportunity to see if dr leslie hayes is still available many people would like her to please comment just a little bit more about the nasal spray and its benefits prophylactically if she could uh if she's available leslie are you there hey leslie you're muted you'd think this far into the pandemic i could work zoom correctly but um on the nasal spray we don't know i mean as far as i know they haven't even started human studies yet and um so we're still waiting to see even if if it will work but basically it provides a physical barrier um somehow it binds the virus and prevents the virus from getting into the nasal mucosa so and also i just put in um to go back to the last question about why the numbers are going up um an article from the washington post about australia and australia surprisingly enough used science and science worked yay for science they followed the recommendations and it was actually enough to get rid of their epidemic and so um uh it's it's worth reading it's stuff we all know and you'll look at it and think oh we could do that we are just not doing it so thanks leslie dr silsa's slides went in earlier in the about 15 minutes yeah doctors dr selissa's slides just came in and we'll we're going to try to get you uh dr hayes slides as well and apparently one of the ingredients in the nasal sprays is an acetylcysteine used for uh allergies seasonal allergies so there you go um another thing with the the surge all around the world is that the death rate has gone way down and wanted to get your thoughts on is it because we know a little bit better how to treat patients or perhaps it's in a younger population now um what are your thoughts on that nestor yeah i think and we i think we have discussed this partially i think it's a mix of things first um this second wave uh at least initially was affecting younger population so demographic is one factor uh the second is yeah definitely we are doing better hours and better monitoring on the patient even if we don't have like a cure we are managing the patient better we are less aggressive with intubation like at the beginning uh i think probably a significant percentage of patients are getting rendezvous especially here in the us and dexamethasone and that may somehow help also the pruning that we're doing the anti-coagulation so i think it's a it's all of the above and obviously the learning curve the icu physician the hospitalist the family practitioners are more uh knowledgeable now that that nine months ago and i think we we are making better decisions for these patients in general uh so i think it's it's a combination of all of that from age um to all the way to like like dexamethasone and anti-population in the in the hospital that may be impacting the overall mortality and i don't know i mean and one thing that was associated with very high mortality was the the the overwhelming uh or the collapse of the of the hospital system if we go to a point where we have you know no icu bits no availability then we're gonna see the mortality go up because that's something that that was documented in northern italy and some places in latin america like ecuador and some cities in brazil that i actually you know had mass graves and everything because they weren't even treating the patient with oxygen because they they had no no oxygen no nasal cannulas etc and people were really dying early with the disease so i think that's another factor that we haven't seen yet in this second way but we're approaching that unfortunately um you know in some in some areas like utah and north dakota et cetera this is leslie i just wanted to add a couple other things one is um we're doing a much better job of keeping it out of the nursing home right now that was a real factor in the early on mortality is and now we've got better ppe and better protocols for nursing homes and then the second thing is early in the pandemic especially in new york they weren't testing you unless you were on the verge of death i mean you had to be really really sick to get a test and the widespread testing actually is helping um to identify people more and so because of that um case fatality rate is going to be lower because we're identifying people who are not so sick thank you everybody we really appreciate dr sosa dr hayes uh clarissa who's um off the call right now uh dr thornton uh christian ramers dr hale it's good to see you on board and uh all of course the participants you make it happen so thank you all um and we'll see you next week um just remember uh to sign in and we also have a first responder echo at uh two o'clock mountain time and the critical care echo i believe carla meets is it the first and third thursday of every month correct and then the next one is the 19th of november and it's ards treatment encoded wow that's a good one not to miss thank you everybody,,11/9/2020
27,hi good afternoon everyone welcome to the coven 19 office hours tele echo session we're really happy to see everybody today uh my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm and one of the associate directors of project echo and i am joined by my hub team who i'm going to introduce as they come on um i'm going to have nestor go first but we also have marla sivers from the department of health here today so we're really excited to have her back um and then we're expecting leslie hayes possibly carissa from uh our tricore labs anyway so we'll go ahead and get started as we have a lot a lot to go over today uh i also um just wanted to ask everyone if you have a camera and you can turn it on we would really love to see your faces we like to build community here and feel like we can do that especially if we we are able to recognize people and see them on camera so if you can please turn it on and we'd like for you to keep it on during the during the session also just wanted to tell you if you have a question during the session please put it into the chat box and we'll try to get to as many questions as we can we would ask you to refrain from actually answering questions that are directed at the hub in the chat box as well so without further ado i'm going to go ahead and have um dr salsa introduce himself and we'll get started with his his um update hi thank you thank you carla first of all thank you everybody i'm dr salsa for those who are new here i'm the infectious disease division chief here at the university of new mexico let me start sharing my my screen so today obviously we have uh a couple of of important news to share let me see if i can okay perfect so first of all obviously the uh i actually the the the whatsapp messaging like at 3 am started beeping because people in other places send me messages this was essentially the news today the the the release by moderna of the information the preliminary information or the efficacy of their vaccine they they communicated that it has an efficacy of 94.5 so now both mrnas vaccines have shown over 90 percent efficacy but obviously we need to wait for for more information and obviously to for the fda to review the the material and and give these companies either an emergency use authorization or or a full authorization but it's definitely good news if you if you think that the wa show established efficacy over 50 percent so so 95 it's it's it's outstanding really for for uh for a new vaccine with a new technology that had never been tested before but we have to wait for the safety and all of the other data that have to come in i have i'm going to review quite a few things so i'm going to go a bit faster but we can go over again in the question and answer first is a publication from from the annals of internal medicine um this group uh actually follow patients for 60 days after their hospitalization they were all hospitalized copied 19 patients here in the united states and they report on on on what happened to these patients after discharge because we know a lot about the hospitalization the icu the cytokine storm everything that we have reviewed but we really do not have that much of of uh reports on what's what's going on we have we know that about the long copy uh surveys and things but but this was more of a more of a close follow-up with phone calls and checking charts and making sure that the patients uh remain alive and were not hospitalized throughout this health health system essentially they they actually gather information from from 1648 patients in michigan 38 different hospital in these in these um company and and the the the overall mortality and we're talking earlier in the in the epidemic it was 24.2 percent during the hospitalization uh so over a thousand patients were discharged alive a thousand two hundred and fifty and you can see seventy-eight percent were discharged home but there was a sizable percentage of patient that went went to uh to a skilled known facility or some other intermediate care so so that's that's the first uh sort of lesson that that even being this an acute viral infection some some patients are not able to go back to to their home and the other interesting data is that after discharge 15 of the patients were re-hospitalized so so that's another thing and we have seen this in unm patient that we have discharged even patients that are in our clinical trial they are you know they're discharged four five six days uh after after they have been admitted and then they they come back with more shortness of breath or or fever or a secondary bacterial infection last week just incidentally i saw three copy patients three with with um staph aureus bacteremia and not related to the lungs it was not lung infection it was some other source of infection um that brought brought them back to the hospital with bacterial infections so interesting and then um after discharge look at this icu patient who were in icu during the initial hospitalization ten percent die and those who were in the hospital award uh 6.7 percent die after that initial hospitalization so so it's really you know alarming numbers um and then the 60-day mortality went from 24 to 29 so one one in three patients that were hospitalized early in this epidemic in michigan actually did not survive um the the two months after the initial infection and there were other other interesting data that they collected so that was from child review this was from a survey they actually called the survivors they were able to to reach 41 of these survivors and they found for instance that that 60 days out they were they are still having cardiopulmonary symptoms 32 percent anos mia 13 difficulty with daily activity 11.9 uh 60 have returned back to work but of those who returned back to work of those 117 one quarter one quarter were still not able to work full time and they were working reduce hours because of health issues there was also significant half of the patients that were discharged uh uh said that they were emotionally impacted by the by the health situation uh 36 percent financially impacted uh nine percent or ten percent use most of their savings and and seven percent said that they were actually raising rationing food heat housing or medication because of the cost of of the hospitalization and what they went through so so definitely you know really some of the depressing numbers that once you get copied and you're hospitalized uh your life at least in the short run changes significantly from all all points of view from the physiologic work uh emotional and financially so so interesting for for those few people who are still denying the importance or the the meaning of these uh of this uh you know disease or pandemic pandemia let me keep going here the other the other interesting story and this is this is um one of those um uh studies from japan that they keep producing this really marvelous research in regarding to to transmission and mass so this this paper was published in in an open journal of the american society of microbiology called mf sphere uh and i think it's it's open source and they actually describe the effectiveness of face mask in preventing airborne transmission of star skull v2 and and what they did they um they created this champ chamber in which you can see there are two mannequins these are mannequins um in which they they put them in different distances 25 50 and 100 centimeters they nebulize virus they use a nebulizer standard nebulizer and they make this mannequin nebulized virus and then they measure how many viruses were able to detect both using culture and pctr having here a collect collection unit in the other area and this mannequin was breathing using an artificial ventilator so so this was sort of the spreader and this was the receiver um and then they obviously control for everything and change the mask change the number of wires change the distance and they calculated there is very interesting this is how the the unit looked in in real life this is a photograph this is a nebulizer the two mannequins the mask uh the ventilator and then the collection unit where they put the the the the device to to be able to analyze them for for both viral culture and pcr and these are the results i'm going to give you just the main results because you imagine they did many many variations first of all there was an inverse relationship between the distance uh and the viral and viral detection so so that you know something that it's common sense but the the closer you are the closer the mannequins the higher the and in these bars the blue bars are the important bars are the viral culture so it's sort of a surrogate for for viable or transmissible virus and you can see that it goes down the farther you go so so there's like a dose respond and these are lower rhythmic scale so so it looks like a small change really it's it's a significant change 70 70 percent um decrease in the in the in the number of viruses detected when you when you go farther and farther away from the from the spreader the second question that they ask in this experiment you know who should wear the mask what what has more impact so they they must take the receiver in these experiments and they match the spreader on this experiment and you can see obviously that without mass this is how they control if if it's a cotton mass there's a slight decrease and then surgical mass more 895 a little bit more and then a 95 with the tape they actually fitted the 895 by putting a tape around the around the mask and you can see how the blue bars go go live go down but you can also see that it's much better to have to put the mask on the spreader to the point that has uh and then a fit and 95 on the spreader basically blocks completely the the vital and and and there's much more impact in um who should be mask or or you know if you have if you have only one mask who should wear is the spreader that's the conclusion based on this data and something that we we knew that that you know that people um using must transmit less the other which stops should the receiver use is the next question so they change the different mask in the receiver they put a different mask on the no mask or a cotton mask on the on the spreader and then they tested all types of mask and as you can see the more sophisticated the mask the the smaller the transmission but it was not a hundred percent at any moment so you can see obviously that feed n95 has the smallest blue bar and so on 95 surgical uh and there was no significant difference between cotton mask and surgical mask um by the spreader so so the important thing is to mask the spreader uh but there was no significant difference between using using a cotton mask or a surgical mask but it does influence the receiver if the receiver has an n95 or a surgical mass is much better than a cotton mask or no mask and the other the other uh important finding that they adjusted also for viral load and they in for the previous experiment that i showed they were using five um uh five two to the five times ten to the fifth um and here they use one and then one to ten to the fourth so smaller and and the bottom line is if you decrease the viral load um there's no cultural viral in any of this situation at 50 centimeter so so so that it's important that that that really to try to be able to transmit at least in this experimental uh setting you need a high wire load over five to ten to the fifth because both low wire loads were basically um undetectable unculturable the the pcr the the brown bars that you see are pcr possible but the blue bars are non-existent here and below the level of detection here when the viral load is really low so that was also some piece of good news and finally the last experiment um was if you use a high wire load like 10 28 really nothing stopped the transmission i mean there's an improvement with n95 but there's no no no situation in which you can really be protected 100 so that's what i put here so in those cases you have to increase the distance i mean if it's up if it's a patient with hybrid load ideally you should wear an a95 and then pray or get the advisor vaccine because there's really no not a hundred percent protection and that's another message so just to summarize that this these studies all type of mass confers some degree of protection cotton approximately 20 to 40 percent in most experiment 895 80 to 90 but never 100 it's better to mask the spreader and if both have mass there's a synergistic effect so if both the spreader and the receiver wear a mask it's better than than either of those as you may imagine and finally even medical masks including surgical and and feed it and 95 were not able to block the virus com completely okay so that was that was the the interesting japanese uh experiment really amazing detail and everything that they went through but give us a lot of information on on the mask the other the other i just to make you make you aware of three um three products that that have shown um efficacy two of them in randomized control trials to prevent uh severe coping or to prevent patients who are infected to go on to develop severe coping and this is this is somewhat some of these experiments are similar to what we are we have been seeing with the with the convalescent plasma and somewhat surprising one of them so let me let me just go so that the first story was published actually in jama it was the use of flu box i mean which is uh which is an uh a drug that is used for ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder is a it's a it's a psychiatric medication it's not an antiviral but uh somehow they tested these uh in a trial and they found they they actually gave it to 80 patients this is a double blind randomized uh control trial and 72 were controls and they found that those who received the fluboxamine did not show any clinical deterioration uh as defined by the story and and as opposed to eight percent eight percent of those who receive placebo and you can you know quickly see that that basically um they use a scale a scale of symptoms there's a lot of cereals on the fluoxamine so meaning that the patient received these drugs actually did really well uh although this is a small story it's only you know very small but but i think enough to to um consider you know as a candy they drop for a larger clinical trial really interesting they really don't know the mechanism they postulate and i and i copy what what it's in the in the discussion they said that a potential mechanism is for a new modulation uh because this drug affects uh the sigma one receptor in the in the in intracellularly so they they go ahead and postulate but nobody really knows for sure how how if if any uh effect how this drug is gonna work but it was kind of surprising to see that in polish in general the other story i have heard about and i read the pre-publication uh this is this is a different story it's a retrospective study done in in hospitals in black broward county in florida they actually um this was in the in the time of the hydroxyl proteins or patients were giving hydroxychloroquine acetomycin and and they added hypermectin if you remember ivermectin who was postulated as a possible antiviral so in this retrospective study this is not a double blind retrospective study 173 patients received are did not receive our regulating but the standard of care at that time that was most of them received hydroxychloroquine plus minus um acetomycin and interestingly enough uh when they did the mortality which was the main primary endpoint they found 15 versus 25 percent uh with a statistically significant decrease in mortality in those who were exposed to hybrid mechanisms so there was an association they did an adjustment trying to adjust for all the the differences in the group and they did this multivariate analysis and and even in the multivariate analysis there was a nose ratio uh of of depth um of zero point two seven percent so so significant also statistically significant decreased mortality in average methane so i'm looking forward to the prospective randomized trial and the last i'm almost on the last paper that i want to show it's uh it's it's also a double-blind placebo control phase two to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhale uh interferom beta one a which is the same that has been used in the act three but but this is inhaled this is through a nebulize or nebulizer treatment they gave it for for 14 days to half of the patient and the other half essentially receive a placebo they enroll uh at the at the end 50 and and 48 patients in each in each arm in this randomized study these were patients were not severely ill if you can see in this table this is the placebo on the left the interferon on the right and you can see that um 38 and 23 were basically hospitalized but but on no oxygen so these were really mild patients and some of them were receiving oxygen 56 75 percent uh but none really where uh or very few only one in each group were really in non-invasive ventilation or high flow so this is my mild disease inhale interfere for 15 days and what they what they found was um a greater odds of improvement using the w ra show symptom scale and it was a theoretical significance they had a nose ratio of 2.3 times more improvement with that with the interferon and also the time to recover it was shortened um and the ultimate recovery was better with the interference hospitalization was not impacted and you can see the the kaplan major here so no change in the in the duration of hospitalization but definitely a significant difference at day 28 of of recovery so this is another product that is that needs like a larger trial um and and you know this product has been used in copd and asthma so it has some safety history behind it uh but it's interesting that it was it was effective and has and we have been reviewing the importance of interfering so it makes sense to to at least try this this drug um and in this case nebula is interfering and no no side effects that's the other thing the profile the safety profile was really identical 60 adverse event in the placebo 54 in the in the interference so the adverse events were related to the underlying disease not really to to apparently not not not to the to the interferon only like five cases had headaches that were by the investigator thought to be associated with interfering but no bronchospasm no difficulty breathing or any any any red flags with this uh relatively small trial so that's what i wanted to share i'm sorry i took so long but there were so many therapeutics and other stories that i thought it was worth sharing thank you thank you so much nestor for that really interesting and up-to-date information i'm going to go ahead and go to leslie hayes and have her present her um updates as well leslie can you introduce yourself hi leslie hayes family and uh that math study was really cool i liked that one a lot so um and i just had a few things i was going to talk about today um the first is actually an article from july and if any of you know dr lazar in gallup um as numbers started going up here i texted her and asked if she had any recommendations on things that she had found helpful when they um had their outbreak and she referred me to this article which is on short-term home oxygen therapy how to do it safely and um effectively and we're probably going to need to do this a lot because we are just not going to have the hospital beds to have all of these people who need oxygen in the hospital and so first they had sort of a flow chart on who you could send and you know they said you can watch them for 48 hours and if they're stable send them home on oxygen but they actually said if you can watch them they're clinically stable for six to twelve hours in the er then you can send them home on short term oxygen therapy um and they did recommend they'd be mild and i would hope nobody would be thinking of sending somebody a coma home on home oxygen i found this chart kind of amusing for that but um they did say they need to be fairly mild and i'm going to say the numbers may not be accurate for us just because um our oxygen center is slow and so we may be willing to have people run a little bit lower than they do at sea level and um then they gave this chart that i thought was really useful on how to follow up on these patients at home once you've sent them home and they mentioned a mobile app but i couldn't find it anywhere in the article and i wasn't sure what they were referring to but um they said you do telephone triage and you call and you ask them about their symptoms and do the breathlessness screening tool which is the next slide that i have if you can get them portable pulse oximetry that's obviously very helpful and then just do a visual check if they have the ability to do that to make sure that they're actually using the equipment correctly and if they've got the o2sat monitor you can be monitoring their sat make sure it's above 93 and their heart rate is in a reasonable place and their temperature is not um going up or down and that their respiratory rate is um doing well and then i really like this breathlessness screening tool it is so simple you can use it on patients who um you're just screening over the phone for um covid and you want to make sure that they're doing okay which is basically you just say take a deep breath in and then count from 1 to thirty and you see how high they can get and if they cannot um get to seven or if they cannot go more than five seconds between a breath they're likely less than 90 and you probably want to have them for their evaluated in an er or in a setting where they can get an o2 stat or um vital signs and then this is an article from psych this is just a one day shot in time it's not a scientific study but i just thought it was interesting going back to what dr sosa said about for the people who aren't taking it seriously and especially for young people who think well it's not going to affect me and the average utahn hospitalized with covet is 54 but half of the hospitalized utahns do not have a confirmed pre-existing condition they were healthy before they went in um right now they have um 473 people in for confirmed cobalt with another 19 suspected and of that 184 so probably about 40 percent are in icu so that's a pretty high percentage to have an icu and a quarter of all utahns hospitalized are between 25 and 44. so it's definitely not a protective you know you're less likely but it's not going to completely protect you a third are between 45 and 64 and 29 of those are over 65 with a small group um under 24 and above 85. gender split is about 50 50. um although 63 percent of utah's covered death so far have been men and roughly five percent of the people in utah who get the fire stand up in the hospital for young adults it's about three percent um for uh 45 to 64. it's about seven percent so really only double um with the young adults and 20 of those 65 to 84 so definitely much higher if you're over 65 but you're not getting off scot-free if you are only 25. and then going back to what doctors said this um study was interesting this was just on persistent fatigue and um they followed 128 patients for the history of covet infection and just over half were admitted to the hospital the remainder were managed as outpatients at that time they were getting the hydroxychloroquine also prednisolone um 36 uh of the patients did not get any targeted therapy and about half were care workers and what they found was that the fatigue was still pretty significant and these were um 72 days out that they were measuring them on average and they found that um the mean fatigue score um uh was 11.38 for physical and psychological for was 4.72 and their case definition said this meant that over half met the criteria for t for fatigue with most of them being well over the the cut off and um 54 or 54 patients only 42 reported feeling fully back to their full health the majority did not 82 have been working and a third of them had not returned to work again roughly 72 days out and they did find that women were much more likely to complain of uh fatigue in addition people who had a history of anxiety or depression were much more likely to be fatigued um being a healthcare worker did not make you more likely to be fatigued which made me happy and um the other thing that i found really quite concerning about this and the reason i wanted to present it was that there was no correlation at all between severity of illness and whether or not you had the long-term fatigue didn't matter if you were hospitalized if you needed oxygen if you went into icu it didn't matter on any of these it didn't matter if you had abnormal labs or not about half of the people on any group were likely to be fatigued several months out then um after looking at the commodity last week i came across this article this week on ppis it's actually a meta-analysis journal mental medicine they looked at five studies with a total of 37 000 patients and they showed a significantly increased odd for a severe fatal course of covid if you used a ppi omeprazole or pentoprazole any of those um it was 1.46 times as likely and they also had a significantly increased odd of secondary infection of 2.91 and we've always known that um ppis are more likely people on ppi's are more likely to get pneumonia so this is not surprising but the inc the increased risk was small in the pooled analysis and they said the decision whether or not to stop ppis in cobit 19 patients or even in patients just as a prophylactic measure should be based on an individual risk assessment but since there's already significant side effects to the ppis i think this is just yet another thing we should be discussing with our patient as to whether or not they want to continue these medications long term and then just a couple of um there was one from the new york times on how can my college student come home safely for thanksgiving that i thought was really useful especially as i have a college student that is coming home next week and we're trying to figure out um how to do it safely and then um the article from the atlantic no one is listening to us is um not surprisingly about healthcare professionals many of us feel that we're not being listened to on what is actually going on and it was really quite good it was a little um discouraging just reading through but um i think most of us will probably identify with it and then the last one was just an article on teletherapy being used to help um with psychiatric uh conditions and how beneficial it has been for so many people and how and i've certainly seen this clinically many of my patients would actually prefer to continue teletherapy rather than coming back and doing in-person appointments but the question is will it actually be covered once this is over so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie for those really um helpful articles you have some comments in the chat about that so um we have a lot of questions so i'm going to move along but i'd like to go to marla marla can you introduce yourself and if you have any sort of high level updates for us that would be great hey good morning everybody or i guess good afternoon now um we marla seaver is an infectious disease epidemiologist from the new mexico department of health we are under a new public health order that went into effect today a two-week stay-at-home order um all non-essential businesses closed and reduced occupancy with essential businesses i'm very happy that this is back in place um you know could not have come soon enough um in my opinion we will see over the next two weeks if we are able to change the trajectory we're currently on with the rate of new cases that are being identified each day i think even with this two-week stay at home order it's going to be very challenging given that the thanksgiving holiday falls within that two-week period and we have unfortunately seen not a high level of adherence um to recommendations that people from different households not to not get together for group activities so um you know hopefully at the end of that two-week period we'll be able to sort of reassess where we are and make a plan for the remainder of the year but given the current trajectory we're on um you know probably the next six weeks are going to continue to be very challenging um in new mexico so that's my high level update thank you marla i'm going to come back to you for some questions in a minute but i also um no carissa colbraith is on she's our infectious diseases medical director at tri-core labs and i wanted to ask chris if she had any updates regarding testing hi um no particular updates today um i will add that we um do continue to see or we're not seeing yet any um significant levels of flu a flu b or rsv and really the only other respiratory virus that we're seeing circulating is rhinovirus so we do encourage people to continue to test for other respiratory viruses when available but if it's not available um to continue to look at the epidemiology and see that we are not having widespread um uh positive tests for any of the other respiratory viruses other than coronavirus and that's all for right now thank you chris so also if people have uh specific testing questions we we have chris on today so that's good so there's a couple of questions about all of your presentations and i'm just gonna um nestor there's a couple of questions about the japan study and whether or not sort of what the implications are for that for people working in health care settings particularly in the hospital um harry sybold asked does this math study from japan argue that healthcare providers in icu patients with presumed high viral loads should be using elastomeric n100s or papers to avoid transmission yeah that's a tough question i mean that you have to ask uh um my hospital epidemiology is really uh i mean one thing is that that from the experience we know that transmission in the health care center uh hellcat setting has been relatively low once you use the appropriate ppe i mean you know your your a95 or surgical mask if you're not doing a high risk procedure we have seen that in in practice the transmission has not been great or or large and and we have seen sarah preval install is in healthcare worker which which are similar to the community server prevalence so that's that's the good news i mean in reality um we we seems to be protected obviously yeah if in a patient with a high viral load and and maybe doing an um aerosol generating procedure the risk it's it's not zero as as if you look at the data from this from these uh from this study and obviously uh you know duration of exposure the distance between the the person and and another thing is the face shield this story didn't include a face shield so who knows if that produces some degree of blockage of some of the particles so so i think um you know it's worrisome a little bit but but in reality the data doesn't doesn't make me be too worried let's put it that way um but obviously the mask alone is not 100 based on this data yeah thank you nestor and jeff miller asked a similar question just about is it maybe is it that possibly the people in the hospital don't aren't achieving that high of a viral load so it's not you're not seeing the infections that you would possibly expect right exactly i mean there may be some patients who are actually like super spread or have very high bar low but remember the period of high bar load is relatively short we're talking a couple of days two or three days because of the if you see the curve of the of the viral load it goes rapidly and sometimes it goes up and the highest peak is at the moment of symptom initiation so when the patient comes into the hospital a lot of times not all of not all the time the curve is somewhat you know going uh in the downward slope so in that way we're somewhat fortunate because we're we're putting patients in in the hospital with seven eight days of symptoms and at that point really the curve is going down and after eight to ten days you're not able to to detect any cultural virus so in most of the patient except for maybe the immunosuppressor so i think all of those factors uh protect us you know in some way thank you nestor and then just oh sorry this is marla i just wanted to add one thought about the japanese study you know they used a nebulizer to simulate the spreader and so you know that would more closely re resemble an aerosol generating procedure um than a person just through normal respiration so i think that's one thing to keep in mind too is the way that that was set up they were really using aerosol generation um as standing in for the spreader exactly that's exactly true in fact they mentioned that they wanted to imitate a cough so it's actually not just a small you know talking etc it was actually two meters per second i think the the speed of the of the aerosol came coming out of the mannequin because that that's what they wanted to to simulate a human cough with the nebulizer okay absolutely right thank you thank you nestor and marla um there's just one very specific question esther about the doses of ivermectin that are being used in covid uh that i don't know to be honest i have to i have to check it i've seen like 200 micrograms per kilogram but that's probably the parasite dose i have to i have to see what they use in the in in florida i haven't seen it yeah and i think that um just i didn't say this in the beginning and for those of you who come on you know this already but kent norrisworthy our our digital librarian is putting all these links into the chat so you can probably link onto that regarding ibermectin to find that out it's relevant because if you remember we have discussed before that there was this individual study with hypermechan that showed you know clearly at least in vitro that it inhibits the virus but then there were there was a publication by by you know people with a background in pharmacokinetics saying that the levels achieved in that experiment were not achievable in humans with regular doses not even with 10 times the normal dose for that we're using hybrid mechanism so there was this sort of separation between what was seen in vitro and what we can achieve in vivo but then there's this florida retrospective study that apparently shows some protection and i have to say there's a study in peru uh that is in pre-publication in which they they also use ivermectin and they couldn't find any benefits so so you know i think the euro is still out regarding our meeting we have to see a good prospective double line placebo control story to see if it has any any any activity um either as a you know early therapy or or late therapy or prophylaxis for that matter thank you and leslie there are a couple of questions about your presentation um syndry well cindy waldron said we should consider how to obtain oxygen at home in rural areas without dme without a dme supplier i don't know if you have any thoughts about that or if anybody on the network does wow we're pretty rural and i've never had trouble getting oxygen for any of my patients so um i don't know if anyone who's more rural than we are wants to comment but um generally the the dme suppliers will go out to the smaller communities to get to deliver the oxygen so okay great thank you and then there was the question about the um counting the breathalysis uh counting thing whether you it's the patient's who's counting or that's you who's counting the evaluator it's the patient to discounting you want to see if how high they can count and they need to get to at least seven and the other thing they said do it in their native language so but uh just have them count as fast as they can and um up to 30 and if they can't get uh to seven then you need to send them in okay got it and then a couple of questions about ppis um why do ppi's increase pneumonia and and now covet 19 severity as well or what is the um thinking behind that dr said you know that one i've always thought it was because it changes the flora but i'm not entirely sure i got away i think that's the main hypothesis that it um i mean neutralizing the acid of the stomach or increasing the ph and the in the stomach which is a normal defense system for for bacteria overgrowth so yeah theoretically it's it's bacterial overgrowth secondary to changes in the ph of the of the the stomach but i don't know if there's any other like uh more molecular explanation regarding bacteria but that's the thought exactly thank you all right um there's a couple of questions for you marla and actually a couple that came in in the before we started the clinic one is can you give us a sense of what to expect in terms of delay to availability of pcr tests and then average your usual delay to getting results right now just given the given what is happening in new mexico yeah i think um i'll defer much of that question to carissa um with tricore if she would like to answer sure um so i think with the current volumes that we're experiencing for general testing it's still within about a three day window for getting results back that may be delayed for some particular patient populations or if there's a longer transit time but in general it's about um three days to get back results um the volumes though are quite high um and i know that there's been some challenges with people getting appointments to get samples collected and that that we're not part of that process and so marla i don't know if you have any information on that um yeah you know i would agree chris i think our state lab is doing well in terms of testing supplies but you know the available time slots for people to receive a test i know it's been very difficult and some people have had to wait a couple of days to be tested i think probably the state lab turnaround time is a little bit longer maybe a day longer than yours right now at tri-core carissa and so you know everyone acknowledges that the delay in test results um is not ideal but people really are working um you know at the state lab and at tricor around the clock to get those test results out as quickly as possible yeah thank you marla yeah i mean there are just questions and i think that um people have been calling me and trying to find out where to get tested is it's hard to find a place to get tested right now and i don't know about the rest of new mexico but certainly in albuquerque i don't know if marla do you have any any other comments about that or what we should be telling people yeah if you go to our website cvnmhealth.org there's a list of available testing sites um each day by county and by city so you can look around to find the nearest testing site we try to keep it up to date with information from the site some of them are run by department of health some of them are private sites about who um they'll test you know is it only someone for pre-procedural testing or symptomatic testing or will they test someone who's exposed and not symptomatic so that information gets updated on our website each day and it kind of varies um from time to time but you know like everyone having staff to run those testing sites with all the other requests for staffing resources you know as i said we're trying to have as many sites open available as we can each day but turn around time and the availability of testing has definitely been impacted thank you and one more question before you um we go to someone else to a question came in before on on the pre-reg questions how many days should we should you wait after exposure before getting tested so we typically recommend that people not be tested immediately after their known exposure um but waiting a minimum of three days and generally five to seven days before being tested is more ideal on that what if they've had sort of repeated exposure they've been living with somebody who you know then comes up positive um would you wait the five to seven days after the last if you don't have kind of a discrete you know time and date of exposure that you're sort of counting from if someone is a household member and you know just sort of found out that a member of their household is positive then we would suspect that you've been exposed prior to finding out about that positive result and getting tested sooner definitely would make more sense thank you marla okay one more question sorry i said it was going to leave you alone but one more question about exposure and quarantine so if you have a patient who has a sort of mildly symptomatic covet and lives in a home with a family member who is negative but in quarantine because of their exposure to the source patient um two questions when the source patient is out of isolation can they be around their family member even though the family member will still be in quarantine yes yes okay and then the second part of that question and if the source patient is still around being around their family member can they go back to work or go be in public yeah so once the source patient is released from isolation and this is kind of the thing that always makes people scratch their head is why the source patient could return to normal activities uh quicker than the person who is exposed so once the person is released from isolation they can resume normal activities but their household members quarantine really period really starts from the date of their household members recoveries because that's the date of their last exposure so someone who's not been able uh to be away from their household member and has continued exposure throughout their illness and infectious period is going to have a quarantine period you know that goes beyond um the date when that index case was released to return to work or other normal activities got it thank you thank you very much okay um back to one more question about a ppis harry seibold was asking if you if you were to stop somebody's ppi would it be reasonable to put them on um on an h2 blocker or is there a problem just with decreasing acid in general i don't know if you know the answer to that last layer so the femonide study from last week where they started it acutely while they were in the hospital actually showed worse outcomes on palmadin so if they could get away without anything i think based on what we have which is not at all you know looking at sort of the outpatient use of commodity i would try and get them off everything but i think if you can get them off the ppi putting them on from modding is safer in many many respects not just um copied and so um i would do that thank you thank you very much okay um kim joy asked the question asked a question about the pfizer vaccine about the you know that has to be stored at such a low temperature if she says i wonder if new mexico is working on ways to store the physio vaccine when it comes a lot of work and planning going on with um our bureau of health emergency management public health division and others um to make sure that we have appropriate cold chain uh storage available for the vaccine once it's available for shipment thank you marla all right i wanted to let everybody know that um just a few minutes ago our feedback report or cme link went into the chat if you would like see me for this session then you need to go ahead and fill that out and we would actually like to we would love to hear your hear your input as well so i'm going to nestor go ahead yeah on the pfizer vaccine i'm advising um the government of panama on the vaccine and and actually pfizer told us that for some other countries i don't know if it's going to work in the u.s they're going to dispense the vaccine in uh containers that have dry eyes um and it's going to be between 1000 and five thousand doses of the vaccine in those containers and you can actually refill the containers with dry ice after a few days so you can sort of even if you don't have a minus you know 90-80 freezer and we're talking obviously third world countries you can actually buy dry ice and and re fill in the container and keep the kid the vaccine and transport the vaccine in this in this portable container so the filezilla is also thinking of ways to circumvent the need for the for the large freezer etc but you know that that may work in some countries but not in all but i just wanted to to put that out because they inform us of that um and in fact we are we are buying a flight sir vaccine for for panama because of the uh you know the pricing issue and other and other decision points and that's one of the way we're going to use it thank you nestor um i wanted to see if krista could answer this one rick foster asked is tricor using pool screening for initial any initial rapid screening um we are doing triport is using um pool testing strategies for certain patient populations that are expected to have a lower positivity rate um and um so i but i would hesitate to call it rapid because it's still within the regular timeline of testing but it does help to increase the capacity to get test results out so when we know we have asymptomatic populations being tested then those meet some of the initial criteria for pooling we're not doing any pooling on symptomatic patients or other high-risk populations thank you thank you very much um yeah there's a lot of questions there anybody on the hub please feel free to answer some of those questions in the chat because there's no way you're gonna get to all of them um let's see so there's a question about whether or not given now that we're having circulating respiratory viruses if a patient has another if they have documented flu or some other respiratory virus should they also should you go ahead and test them for covet or would you not test them for covid i don't know nestor what your thoughts are well i would like to actually if karisa can clarify the the test that they they have because i know they have incorporated the fabr and some other like combined testing that will help answer that question because i know they're they're testing that are combined with some of the most common uh respiratory virus and call it so i don't know if you can help with that sure absolutely um so first i will say that having another respiratory virus does not exclude somebody from having covet and in fact early on in march we were seeing co-infections with covid and other respiratory viruses so i would still continue to encourage testing for covid if other respiratory viruses are diagnosed there are several um rapid molecular diagnostics and and um i want to distinguish you know rapid tests aren't all the same um so i'll speak to them specifically by platform um the roche liat and um the cepheid gene expert um are both smaller multiplexes that have flu a flu rsv and covid all included um on those platforms and those are very high quality molecular tests that have the same sensitivity as um the big laboratory um tests and then there's other platforms that have a more extensive panel that are also rapid um the uh a bio bio fire has a rapid test that has you know all of the respiratory viruses adenovirus and human metanema virus pair influenza and all of those along with covid as does a genmark eplex has the same type of format um and so many of the manufacturers are now adding i'm sorry's cov2 on to their um their molecular platforms so when there is the opportunity to do a molecular test that's inclusive of other respiratory viruses that should certainly be um considered um and continuing to focus on the largely um healthy um maybe not even going to be hospitalized patients to focus on the fluid fluid rsv sars cov2 panel and then the patients that are going to be hospitalized onto the larger multiplex panel so we are you,,11/16/2020
28,hi good afternoon everyone welcome to the coven 19 office hours really happy to see everybody today and hope everybody had a great thanksgiving holiday if you had one um so we're gonna go ahead and get started i just want to let everybody know that um we would love to see your faces so if you have a camera we would really like for you to turn it on during the session um also if you have a question during the session please put it into the chat box and we will try to get all your answers your questions answered that we can we would ask that people refrain from answering those questions in the chat box unless we ask you to and also we may call on people um to to ask questions but we would like we'd like for you to go ahead and um keep your microphone muted unless we ask you to unmute it um i'm dr carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at the university and one of the associate directors of project echo and we have our hub team here um and i'm going to introduce really quickly and when they um give their update to they can say a little bit more about themselves we have dr nester sosa who is our chief of infectious diseases we have marla sivers from the department of health who's infectious diseases epidemiologist karissa kulbraith and cecilia thompson both from tricor who are really excited to have both of them and i do not see leslie yet but we'll introduce her when she comes on so without further ado we're going to go ahead and get started with dr sosa's uh update for us today thank you carla so i'm necessarily an infectious division chief um let me put this in the presentation mode there you go okay can you hear me well good okay so let's let's do the update as i said we have a couple of weeks since i did the last update so there are a couple of news and and and publication that i'd like to go through one of the one of the um news or advances it's the approval by the fda uh or eua of the fda to bury city nib which is the drug called lumiant which is used in rheumatoid arthritis and this was based on the study that that we did here at unm in among other places uh with in combination with deciber apparently the the result of the of this trial which has not been published showed that patients who received both rendezvous and varicity had a shorter uh hospitalization so based on those findings and and the knowledge that we have of the activity of varicity which is a janus kinase inhibitor which decreases the the inflammatory signal within the cells uh it was it was given approval to use in combination with rendezvous and and for those who follow guidelines there was an update a new update on on the infectious disease society of america guidance on kobe 19 so so those are two relevant pieces of news i'd like to to review an article that i've seen a lot of a lot of advertisement in different podcasts and comments it was a paper about the immune response and it is essentially good news i mean we have discussed throughout this pandemic or our doubts about how long lasting the immunity to the to the natural infection with kobe 19 would be at some point we said it was only six months other people said three months then some publications um mentioned maybe a longer and i think this week we have seen several publications but this is probably one of the most uh complete papers that i have seen it was uh it's actually in the pre-publication stage but i think it's going to be published in one of the science journals it's called immunological memory to source kobe 2 assessed for greater than six months after infection and this investigator uh led by shane crotty um actually study in-depth the immune response of 185 kobe cases uh with a broad range of ages mostly adults 57 female those 92 were not hospitalized and and 41 uh cases were um detected or studied six months after infection and they did like a very complete immunological profile they measure levels of igg iga ign to the spike protein in general to the receptor binding domain and to the nucleocapsid of the virus they measure also neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus assay they study the memory cells on these patients and also t cell response cd8 and cd4 i specifically against the entire um group of proteins produced by the by the stars cov2 so they did sort of a of a complete um immunological evaluation of these patients um in several time points and the important messages of this study it's number one that the antibodies uh against the spike protein which is which is considered the most important antibodies and also against specific the region of the receptor binding domain is very stable so they follow this patient all the way to or they have patients with over 240 days and you can see that there's very very a mild decline with a very long half-life for this antibody level so so the preliminary conclusion is that the antibodies that are produced apparently are sustained over time at least for six months which which is really encouraging and in fact um if if we look at the iga which are the mucosal antibodies which are also important for disease prevention you can see that after initial decrease in the level um the antibodies are basically plateau with a very very long decay so essentially they are sustained in time uh both to the to the spike protein and to the receptor binding domain so so good news for for uh from from this well conducted study the same happened with the neutralizing antibodies so they study specifically those who are considered neutralizing antibody and you can see like early on in the first month is some decay and maybe this is what we were seeing in the earlier stories but when you follow these patients um longer the the levels are sustained in time so those are good news and then they look at the memory t cells and memory t cells are important because even if you if you uh decrease your levels of antibodies you're going to have in the germinal centers in the lymph nodes this memory b cells that are sort of programmed to produce antibody if they encounter the antigen again so if you are exposed to the virus in the future these memories b cells will um you know activate again and start producing antibodies and you can see they actually measure specific memory cells against the spike protein against the receptor binding domain and against the nucleocastic and you can see that they are also sustained in number and sustaining time so we we develop memory cells memory uh b cells uh for for a long period of time so that those are good news uh and if you look at the different types of of memory b cells uh depending on the type of antibody as you expect igg lasts almost you know indefinitely or for a long long time you can see the curve there's a long plateau only igm really decreases and we know that from other infections igm is sort of a temporary antibody uh that that tends to decrease so except for for ign which is something that we expected this decline uh over six months both igg and iga specific memory cells are persist in in most of these patients and then the story with the t cells is slightly different they have a different kinetics and there is some decline in the cda um and um cda to the to the to the sarsko v2 and specifically cdas that are activated against a spiked protein so there's some decline but even that the half-life is pretty pretty long 166 days so good news throughout this paper these are um cd4 also similar kinetics so the conclusion of this paper just to summarize a very you know detail is that first of all the each each component of the immune system has slightly different uh kinetics um but the but the antibodies against spike um and and also the neutralizing antibodies last for at least six months maybe more because you can see that that there's very slow decline it's going to have uh sort of a long tail of antibodies and then spike spike memory b cells are also long lasting um the only sort of faster decades with the t cells that you you could see it as six months started to decrease and the other interesting um finding of this study is how heterogeneous the the reaction is although those lines that i showed you were like the average or the mean uh antibody levels or or b cells there was some variation between people and this can probably explain the rare cases of reinfection that we have been discussing their their patients are in fact produce very low levels of antibody there are few patients that lose their antibodies uh so so you know that's that's probably what we are seeing with those three infections that have been reported in the literature i think the count goes around 26 last time i checked 26 confirm um re-infections and we don't really know why the heterogeneity if it's a genetic thing or what's behind that but that we'll probably see more explanations in the future and talking about reinfection how frequent are we infection we have seen just a sporadic case report and we always end up this discussion of reinfection asking ourselves how frequent are we infections and by just seeing isolated cases we cannot reach that conclusion but there was a study uh also in pre-publication that i found very useful from um from the uk they actually uh tested uh 12 over 12 000 healthcare workers and they they did um antibodies to see who was positive and who was negative they found eleven thousand seven negatives that had not been exposed to sars kobe two and and and over twelve hundred um several positive and they follow them to see what how frequent was symptomatic infection in those who already had kobe 19 so to answer the question that we are have been asking ourselves how frequent are reinfections and they follow this patient for 30 weeks in this study and you can see the frequency among those who were not infected i mean there were several negatives so they were not immune they found 89 infections so it was a ratio of 0.46 per per 10 000 days at risk this is how they measure it and zero zero no symptomatic infection among those several positive patients so zero infection so if we're going to have reinfection it's definitely a rare event especially symptomatic reinfection that's that's the main conclusion of this paper and the other they also look for asymptomatic infections so really mild disease and they did find three patients who had uh positive pcr despite being cera positive but some of these three patients may have been just reactivation of their infection so it's very very uh very small proportion of patients with with the so-called reinfection that that that we have been seeing in isolated case reports so that's that's also reassuring uh you know knowing that that at least in this cohort of of of healthcare workers that were follow after being positive they really did not develop significant disease uh in 30 30 weeks of follow-up and and there's there's also something also related to this finding uh sorry this this investigator this was published in eclinica this investigator actually did a study to compare the different sort logic uh testing but i'm not going to get into that it's really for me the most interesting thing it sort of confirms the first story that i told you about that although you know the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are are pretty decent and this is 77 to 100 i made a mistake there um but the important thing was there were five percent of of of these patients who were the having they had copied before five percent had no antibodies so they tested negative for all of these different um test testing assays so there is a small percentage and this goes to what i mentioned before about heterogeneity genetic there's a five percent uh patients um that do not mount antibodies and they may be the population actually um that can have a re-infection or susceptible to have infection more than one time in their in their in the in the epidemic the other the other important paper uh that was published was i think one paper that actually explains more the pathophysiology of the proton body uh state of the copy 19 patient we know that there have been many reports a patient with kobe develop can develop thrombotic events both in arteries and veins they can develop pulmonary embolism dbt and even in the autopsy that we have reviewed some of the micros microscopy um the lungs are filled with these uh small blood clots in the in the capillaries so so there's definitely solid evidence that there's a prothrombotic state but really the explanation of of up until now was that that the coagulation or the increased calculation was associated with inflammation you know we know that inflammation can trigger the in the correlation cascade but actually these investigators which are actually experts on on prothrombotic states and experts on anti-phospholipid they have found something um that that seems to be to be triggering the proton baltic state and it's the presence of auto antibodies they actually um publish this in in a journal called science translational medicine in which um they they actually took 172 copied positive hospitalized patients who were significantly ill 19 of them died and they measured during the hospitalization they measure or look for antiphospholipid antibodies you know there there's a a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome in which patients have like like a pro a thrombotic state and there's actually one called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in which you know patient needs to be anticoagulated because the risk of having thrombosis in many different organs is very severe so so it was interesting that they found in kobe patient is this 172 uh unselected copy patient they found 52 of those have antiphospholipid antibodies so more than half of them and 30 percent have very high titers titus con you know which are very similar to ones the ones that we see in patients with the antiphospholipid uh syndrome and and they they went into details of which and which antiphospholipid antibodies they found the most frequent was anti-for fatty dilserine prothrombin in 24 igg and and then they also found anticardial lipid which is another lipid which is another antiphospholipid that we know from from other infectious diseases um that that are produced but so these these um antiphospholipid antibodies obviously are associated with a pro quality state and one of the interesting finding is that it's associated patients who have elevated levels of antiphospholipid had neutrophil hyper reactivity and it's interesting because these neutrophils are activated in a way that they release um sort of a of a proteination material that that uh traps um platelets and it's actually called it's nearly called nets so it's neutrophilic um extracellular traps and and this promotes um platelet aggregation within the vasculature so that's the mechanism and how this uh presumably how these antiphospholipid antibodies work and patients with high apl had also more severe respiratory disease lower gfr so so they are definitely a marker or more severe copy copied infection and the other neat thing that the these investigators did they took the the igg the the apl from from these kobe patients and they cultivated neutrophils of healthy people and they were able to find that those igg from from kobe patients those apl those antiphospholipid antibodies actually um made a neutrophil from healthy subjects behave in the same way they started releasing these extracellular traps and and aggregating platelets in in vitro and also they injected mice with uh with these antibodies and they also had two models of increased thrombogenesis in mice just by using these antibodies so so they were you know in very detailed fashion uh to to prove that that this apl this antiphospholipid are probably the mechanism for the prothrombotic effect and interestingly enough they can reverse in mice they can reverse this effect with dipyridamole which is an anticoagulant and this is this is the photograph of those nets which i think we i think are really neat this is a normal control igg and neutrophils and when when you uh expose these neutrophils in vitro to the kobe 19 antibodies um they actually release these green things which are like the net uh the so-called uh neutrophil extra extra cellular um traps and obviously this this net can trap other cells can trap platelets and increase coalation within the within blood vessels so this is the mechanism and they have this need of photos to illustrate immunofluorescent photo to illustrate the nets the netosis or the production of these extracellular traps that are thought to be related to the to the coagulation so conclusion of this paper apl antibodies are common 52 percent may be implicated in the prothrombotic effect and this opens the question of can we use something like the pyridamole that we know that it's a it's it's an antagonist of of this um platelet aggregation in this fashion and the other thing can we use plasmapheresis in some of these patients that are severely ill to remove those apl from the circulation so those are a question that the authors pose and obviously also raises concern if we're using convalescent plasma are we transfusing apls when we use complexion plasma as opposed to a more purified monoclonal antibodies we don't know but it's something that that the authors comment in the discussion finally um i just want to show a couple two pictures actually to uh slice i was impressed by this story uh i think out of a group from from germany and other countries in which they they analyze the the the mortality and also the incidents and and i was really impressed uh this is this graph reflects the infection or the attack rate of the population so you can see amazing peru 62 percent um and in mexico ecuador and panama which is my country really very high presume attack rate so the proportion of the population that are thought to be infected is actually 10 stein higher than spain or some other some of the european countries and actually if you look at the list um i think seven seven countries out of the first ten are are from from latin america and usa is right there i put a square so it's very also relatively high um but it's amazing which are the countries that have been affected if you would ask me probably in march or january which were the countries i wouldn't predicted that it was going to be latin america and the us they're more affected by the by the epidemic so interesting and the other final slide that i want to show you is really cool this is this is some electron micro photograph of the novavax vaccine the nova vaccine has a has the the entire um spike protein and has an adjuvant which is from from from a tree it's actually a plant-based adjuvant and when they did a photo a microphone photograph you can see these these are the spike proteins um and they form like a small flower like a rosette here and this is this is how how the the proteins associate in these uh in this vaccine and this is the photo of the of the adjuvant which is sort of a um ecosystem or geometrical uh structure so i thought it was cool that that they actually um look because some people thought that that the adjuvant was actually associated with the with the protein but they're actually floating there in the vaccine they're not interacting at least not in this in this um study of the of the nova magazine which is a vaccine that has not been um it's not as far as advanced as the mrna this is a protein adjuvanted protein vaccine that's it i'm not going to talk about this during the sake of time thank you let me stop sharing that was my update for today thank you very much excellent information as always um i wanted to go next to um carissa chris i don't know if you just to see if you have an update and then if not we'll come back we'll just we'll come back to you for questions um i think just a brief update from the the testing standpoint especially particularly as we move into what would we would normally see as the flu season that just to let everybody know that tri-core monitors our respiratory virus infection rates um across all of our systems and we're not seeing significant levels of influenza or rsv there's a bit of rhinovirus that we continue to see in the community but not high levels of flu a flu b or rsv however we along with the department of health continue to recommend that we test for these viruses when they would be suspected so that we can have a handle on what's going on in the community so just continue to just keep an eye out on that but we are not seeing flu or rsv at levels that we would normally see them at this time of year and that same pattern is being observed across the country with lower fluent rsv rates and that's beginning to mimic what was observed in the southern hemisphere and so we're hoping that we can at least hold off on flu or rsv as we continue to manage covid thank you krista can you just introduce yourself a little more formally sir sorry about that uh charissa colberth i'm medical director for infectious disease diagnostics at tricor labs um and um my colleague cecilia thompson is also on the call today thank you thank you thank you real for being here um marla can you do you have any updates thanks carla i just wanted to take a minute to talk about the anticipated changes coming from cdc regarding duration of quarantine for people who are exposed to sars kobe 2. as you all know the recommendation has been that people quarantine for the duration of the incubation period so 14 days after their exposure however there are some anticipated changes um to that cdc guidance that are currently in clearance at cdc and we expect to be released sometime in the next couple of days that are going to offer some additional options for ending that quarantine period early i think what's important to know is that this is not based upon any change to the incubation period for the infection but rather some modeling data looking at risk of infection so the time from exposure to infection is a bit of a bell-shaped curve that peaks around five to seven days and in the modeling um that cdc has done if you look at the tail between 10 and 14 days after exposure um you know around one percent of infections um developed during that time period so it's really looking at the probability of people becoming infected later after their exposure versus earlier again not a change in the actual incubation period of the disease itself what we anticipate based upon discussions and meetings we've had with cdc over the last few weeks leading up to this change is that there will likely be uh two options uh one reducing the quarantine period uh to just a simple 10-day or the date of um exposure you know assuming a person does not go on to develop illness themselves during that time frame and then also an option to be able to test out of quarantine early um by testing it around day seven we've had been having internal discussions um about how we'll implement this change in new mexico the risk after 10 days is not zero and you know if you look at the modeling data the confidence interval actually goes up to ten percent between one and ten percent um so it may not be a negligible risk cdc from what we understand is not going to include any tiered guidance for people who may be in high risk settings such as nursing homes or corrections where ending that quarantine early may have more significant impacts if someone does go on to develop illness so as that information is released from cdc uh new mexico department of health will be having a lot of internal discussions about how we'll implement this guidance in new mexico which might include some tiered guidance for those congregate settings so more to come on that great thank you thank you marla and um i'm gonna go lastly to to leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself and and give your update leslie hayes family medicine in espanola i'm just going to talk real quick i am actually just out of quarantine myself for covet and i just was going to talk real quick about the experience so and um i am 56 really no health problems other than mild asthma and i did have a hip fracture in may of this year i had worked together in an office for a day with someone who um we were masked and we were six feet apart for the entire day but i was told later that she had tested positive recovery it actually turns out it was family member although um she had developed a fever the day after i worked with her i tested just to be cautious on november 10th on november 13th while i was out walking i have always a sore throat in nasal congestion and they were just a little bit worse later that day i developed some diarrhea which is not typical for me and then by late afternoon i was so fatigued i could barely move headache and my sore throat was getting worse and i still did not believe i had coveted until the test result actually came back positive the next morning there were other clinic employees who tested positive we all tested positive within a two day time period none before since we cannot figure out a common exposure between us um and since everybody always asks i will say i do have really no idea how i got it it's possible the person i worked with actually was positive i did not go to weddings or family gatherings or anything i went to a grocery store in los alamos which has the lowest positive rate in the state and i had my daughter over to watch the bachelorette but we were also six feet apart in math so i really don't know how i was exposed um i isolated for ten days my symptoms gradually worse in the first five days and then i got acutely short of breath on day six my oxygen satin respiratory rate and pulse and temp all remain normal although respiratory weight and pulse went up a little bit and oxygen went down but none of them reached the abnormal range after that i've been gradually improving and um there are lots of health care workers testing positive recently um according to the guardian 900 employees at mayo clinic kotkovid in two weeks the vast majority of staff who were infected 93 were not infected at work and those who did get infected were mostly caught while eating without a mask during their break please do not eat with your co-workers that's really one of the highest risk situations there is um and then a thousand cleveland clinic workers were sidelined due to covet 19. the increase was mostly again reflective of community spread and like i said it is possible i caught this in the community but i would really be a little bit mystified how i did and we have had trouble staffing various parts of our clinic recently because we've had enough people exposed because community spread is just so high in my community and i suspect the same is also true for elsewhere in the state um i got out of isolation on november 23rd and cheerfully took a picture of the kob announcement because i was in that recovered and i was going to comment on so within the week after getting out of isolation i actually had two doctors appointments scheduled that have been scheduled over a month before and i called to make sure people were going to be okay with me coming into clinic and they were really quite nervous and upset about it and oh my gosh we don't know if we want you in and i was fine delaying it but they kept saying they wanted me to test and i kept saying i really don't want to test because then i just thought i would get into this whole thing of having you know positive rna for weeks and not being able to go so this was a meta-analysis um in the landsat and they looked at 79 different studies and what they found was that there was sars cov2 rna shedding for an average of 17 days in the upper respiratory tract so if you're testing the nose or the saliva 14 days in the lower respiratory tract 17 days in the stool and 16 days in serum samples however some people and i don't know if people remember but back in the early days of the pandemic we had a couple that we presented to the echo clinic who shed virus for close to three months and um or had positive rna for close to three months and what they found was the maximum duration of shedding was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract 59 days in the lower respiratory tract 126 day in stool and 60 days in serum and in general the older you are the more likely you were to shed rna for a longer period of time however what they found and this is the important part no study detected live virus beyond day nine of illness despite um persistently high viral loads from cycle threshold values um the cyrus cov2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the first week of illness and there were 11 studies that worked to isolate live virus they were all able to isolate live virus during the first week and none of them were able to get live virus beyond day nine and um most of them were not able to get live virus beyond day eight and they did find the highest likelihood of a positive culture on day three of symptoms which goes along with other things we said um and just a few thoughts one was i had what is considered mild coveted you know i did not require an er visit i didn't really need medical care but this was still quite unpleasant i was really close to bedridden for about 10 days and i think a lot of people think of mild cobit as two or three days of short sore throat and i think we really need to stress that mild cobit is really like a bad case of influenza for most people and then the other thing i think we need to stress to our patients is covet presentation is really quite variable um as i said there were several people who tested positive at the same time as i did one person had a very mild sore throat another person has fever and severe headaches another person had shortness of breath and mild hypoxia and then a friend was hospitalized for five days um requiring room desevere and dexamethasone and she actually is just as an aside spent the first two days of her hospitalization on a gurney in the er because of lack of beds so and i think people think you're either in the icu with it or you know you have sort of um the you know sore throat and fever and are sick for several days and i'm personally seeing a lot of people who have sort of a mild sore throat or a mild runny nose and they're like well i can't have covet i'm not sick enough and i think we need to stress that the presentation is extremely variable and that we need to be testing people for all of the symptoms and people need to be quarantining the other thing i just wanted to mention sort of the five stages of grief and cova diagnosis and five stages of grief as we all know our denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance and i also think shame and fear should be included somewhere on those stages of grief and i was a little surprised by quite how ashamed i was of having coveted and i have actually been making an effort to talk to people about it because i want to see if we can take away some of the stigma around it because especially i spent about 20 of my working day talking to people about how to avoid covet and the fact that somehow i managed to get it despite the fact that this is really something i do a lot and i consider myself fairly knowledgeable about it it was a little bit uh disconcerting and like i said i was a little bit embarrassed about it and i think we need to do everything we can to avoid covid but it is also very very contagious and it's easy to get even if you're following all the rules and so i think we need to you know sort of let go of that shame and embarrassment i think the fear is fairly obvious denial i myself have found myself being very annoyed when people come into the clinic and say they have no covet symptoms and then you get in the exam room and they're like oh yeah i've had this runny nose and cough for a week but i will say on the day that i developed covid um initially i'm you know with the sore throat and runny nose it's so common for me i didn't pay any attention to it but the symptoms i got later in the day were not normal for me and i still ate dinner with my husband that day and i'm like what was i thinking i did sleep separately from him that night but i should never have eaten dinner with him that day but it's so easy just to say no it's fine it's not going to be covered um anger i wasn't really angry at whoever gave me covet but i stopped to think about it and covet turned one year old during the time i had coped which means it probably went through a minimum of 50 people and i'm sure at least some of them were not following guidelines and i must admit to being somewhat irritated with them so anyway i think it's worth just kind of going through with our patients some of what they may experience with having covered then one other thing as i mentioned i had a hip fracture back in may and i was non-weight-bearing for two months and partial weight bearing for three months after that and it's made me think a lot about being disabled and what an effect that would have had on getting covered i honestly do not know how i could have fed myself if i got in covet while i was non-weight-bearing because there's my husband was leaving food outside the room but there's no way i could have picked it up and brought it into the room where i was i wouldn't have wanted him to come in where i was um i also don't think i'd have been able to get out of bed at all because i was so weak during that time that you know if you'd covered on top of it and i realized for many of my disabled patients this is always going to be an issue they're always going to struggle with this if they get co-bit and their caretakers are probably going to have to be much more likely to be exposed so we really should think about this with our patients who are disabled then the other thing is just when i was more severely disabled i interacted with a lot more people just because i needed so much more help and i had many more medical appointments so the people are going to be more likely to be exposed and this is not an issue for me i didn't need a paid caretaker fortunately but for my patients who do need paid caretakers it's been really hard to find them um people you know are scared about being in close contact um it's been harder for people to come across the border and many of the caretakers have been immigrants in the past so this has also been an issue and then people brought me lots of wonderful food while i was sick i was so grateful i did not have either the loss of taste or smell and then dr sosa already talked about the antibodies in detail this particular article if anybody is not following your local epidemiologist she's well worth looking at she just writes very down to earth articles explaining a lot of the research coming out i won't go through them in detail since dr sosa already went through the other study but basically there were three separate publications that show antibodies lasted 120 155 and 240 days with covid which made me very very happy and i've decided i refuse to be in the group of the five percent who did not have antibodies and um caveats um the study from dr sosa does look like they're going to be neutralizing antibodies um but uh if you have coveted antibodies but don't have the neutralizing antibodies you can carry the disease without um or carry the virus without actually getting the disease so the asymptomatic infection that dr sosa was talking about and there are of course the cases of covidre infection and that is all i had thank you very much leslie for putting a human face on this disease and and completely agree with you that really people a lot of people feel ashamed and they don't want to get tested they don't want to tell anybody and it's a really really big problem for to try to control this epidemic so thank you for bringing and show bringing us that story and telling us what happened to you and i'm so glad that you feel better thank you the other thing with the shame is i think it really contributes to the denial because people are so ashamed of it that they then are like no i couldn't possibly have cobit it's you know because covet only occurs to bad people who aren't following the rules so exactly thank you i just want to go there's a couple of questions about um we're still talking about antibodies um robert gish asked when would you need to vaccinate a person who had natural immunity would they need a booster effect i don't know yeah the answer is we don't know i mean the the in some of the trials are not uh discriminating against or excluding those who have had copied so we are going to see in the the data of how did how well the those who had coming and were vaccinated with some of the vaccine candidates are doing to see if it works us over a booster because we we can see after the first dose if their antibodies are higher um than than the rest of the non-infected cohort but we i think we need to see the the vaccine story especially that sub population of people who are vaccinated after having copied inadvertently or or or knowingly thank you nestor and do you know anything um trevor hawkins asked does the antibody response vary by age gender or ethnicity was that in that study yeah that i didn't see honestly i i know it changes with severity um you know mild disease have been reported to have milder levels or lower levels of antibody but i haven't seen uh stratified by age or ethnicity okay thank you and then kim cam joy can you hand me yourself an introduction i mean introduce yourself and ask your other question about the mrna vaccine i'm not sure i understood the question um i hope it's a good question oh this is kim joy i'm a nurse practitioner from espanola um i was wondering if there's data about the new the mrna vaccines that are coming out if it reduces transmission as well as prevents people from responding to the virus does that make sense yes we don't know yet i mean we we only know the the the protection from the seas or from severe this is which is what what they have communicated in the pre-release but we don't know if it uh decreases transmission um i mean if i have two guests i would say yes because there was such a dramatic uh decrease in symptomatic and also asymptomatic and severe disease that it's most likely that's going to be the the the story but but we have to wait and see what happened with with those who who were vaccinated and and see if there were secondary cases um in their homes or around them thank you nestor um there and then leslie asked a question given that five percent of people don't develop antibodies is it withdrawing levels after infection or vaccine to measure antibody response uh well i haven't seen that as a routine practice and most of the antibodies have been done as part of sort of prevalence studies um i'm wondering if if clarissa has like do a lot of people request antibodies for other reasons just to see they're being infected or if you can comment on that because i really don't know i mean you know we know that there's this five percent of of people that do not want an antibody response that i know that's going to be translated into a recommendation to test to see if you're immune or simply get the vaccine and move forward so so far our request for antibody testing has been almost minimal just hardly any requests have come in for antibody testings really since we went live several months ago and then once the vaccine is produced then we'll we'll actually have to go back and look at our antibody test to see if they would detect antibodies to the portion of the virus that are used for the vaccine and so and to look at our antibody tests in in the perspective of the vaccine there are a couple of um antibody tests that have come out that look at different targets antibody targets to be able to provide a little bit of a differential response that would theoretically be able to say was this a vaccination versus a natural infection maybe people can go back and think about their like hepatitis serologies and think about it in that type of context but right now we don't have lots of requests for um for the antibody and it's really unclear to me right now whether or not our current test would be able to identify individuals who have been vaccinated thank you carissa there are a couple of questions about testing capacity in new mexico i wanted to see get your comments and also marla's just to how we're holding up here in new mexico in terms of testing capacity i don't know who wants to go first i can start um we're we're holding on um sometimes by a thread and sometimes by a nice solid rope um but testing uh continues to be a challenge within the number of cases that has increased um that just increases the number of context contacts right now our hospital-based turnaround time is still at 24 hours so tests that come in through our hospitals are resulting in 24 hours at least through our tri-core systems and we've deployed rapid testing including both rapid molecular tests and rapid antigen tests at the hospitals all of the rapid antigen tests if they're negative they get backed up by a pcr and for the community based testing those turnaround times are certainly starting to slip into the three to four day turnaround times and so you know we're doing the best that we can to get through those those test requests but the volumes are incredibly high um and um everything everything anybody can do to help us on that front we accept uh any any help and support um marla i don't know if you have anything else to add thanks carissa the only other thing i'll add is you know we continue to try to find new labs to partner with to expand a test capacity in new mexico and try to decrease those turnaround times including curative which is the lab that's performing the saliva based test we started offering tests through curative at the balloon fiesta site last week and so you know we're doing everything we can to sort of diversify our testing and increase those turnaround times and offer more testing in communities thank you thank you both nestor there's a couple of questions about the anaphospholipid antibodies story one is if um if somebody has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome already are they at higher risk of of complications and also um trevor hawkins asks should we measure antipostolipid antibody to determine uh anticoagulation regimens in patients right well regarding the first question i mean i haven't seen anything specific until about till now about the antiphospholipid i guess most of these patients are usually taking some type of anticoagulation prophylactically and obviously if they get covey that should not be stopped because you know they definitely at least in theory have an increased risk of thrombosis um so and and i mean i don't know i mean the the frequency regarding the second question do we need to do this test routinely um it was so high 52 that i would definitely discuss that especially in a patient in the icu with a high level high risk of of thrombosis that you're making the decision should we do use prophylactic anti-violation or maybe um full-blown anti-population or therapeutic anti-coagulation i would definitely throw in if it's not too costly or difficult uh some some of the commercially available antiphospholipid tests because that may even as i said um take us to consider other things like plasma pharisees or or or uh deeper read them all or more aggressive anti-coagulation so so yeah i think at some point when people digest this this paper and and translate that into into maybe uh some trials to to see if it's worth doing it or or or actually changing the interventions you know we may see that in the future especially for the severe hospitalized icu patient that that may have these uh antiphospholipid antibodies thank you thank you nestor marla i'm gonna go to you just can you just clarify for the from the department of health standpoint who the who is recommended to be tested for covet at this time like what the recommendations are and that may answer some of the questions about testing sure you know our official testing recommendations haven't changed so anyone symptomatic anyone with a known exposure to a case people who are essential workers um you know so we've had pretty broad uh testing recommendations in new mexico and part of that was because we had great testing capacity early on when our case counts were lower we certainly have you know started to see the limits of our testing capacity hasn't really changed you know there are some more tiered recommendations saying you know a priority should be a person who's experiencing symptoms or a person with a known exposure and then sort of you know going down in priority from there but currently at new mexico department of health testing sites um anyone who'd like to be tested can be tested thank you and leslie asked the question what do you recommend about people testing before getting together with family because this may have they have been part of the problem last week she's shaking her head yeah i mean i think people want that to be a useful tool more useful than it is and i think we've talked a lot on this call about you know your test is a single point in time um depending when you were exposed you know you may not test positive but be incubating illness or you could have become exposed sometime after you had that specimen collected and go on to develop illness so it's not a perfect tool for screening out all possibility of exposure or illness and giving you sort of a free pass to to congregate with other people but i know people have tried to use it that way okay one more testing question if a if a positive patient completes their 10 day isolation but continue to experience loss of taste and smell should they continue to isolate or is that just considered a lingering symptom so the recommendation for discontinuing isolation is that someone has improvement in their respiratory symptoms so people don't have to be completely asymptomatic but their respiratory symptoms need to have improved um in addition to that 10 days before being released from isolation so we know that people may have lots of lingering symptoms beyond that 10-day period but their symptoms should have improved thank you very much um a lot i want to make a comment on the testing there was a paper i didn't have time to review it completely but i i did sort of a summary and and it was it was published in the annals of internal medicine if i remember correctly and the first author is uh lauren kuzerka in which they actually um by looking at the literature they came up with the false negative um rate of testing in different days according to the symptom initiation and for instance on day five which is the day the day five of exposure which is the day of symptom initiation for most patients it's like the the median uh incubation period they found 38 false negatives so so that reassures what marla just said that if you have a negative test and you have a very likely exposure it doesn't rule it out um like on day 8 which is day 3 of symptom it was down to 20 but it still has 20 false negative that you can still have copied later on uh but just in that time point and this is with pcr this is not with antigen or some other least sensitive test so you know it is considerable um um in real life i mean because people are tested in different moments and they may or may not be at that moment uh having rna in their in their secretion or there may be some some performance uh differences in the test so it's important that not to be complacent with a negative test if you have a strong strong uh history of exposure you can retest the person you know a couple of days later uh continue the quarantine until you're sure he's not really sick so i i just wanted to share that um and i think yeah the the librarian post the article really nice article uh in in the annals thank you nestor and um there's a question for you it says you and or marla how effective is measuring temperatures as a screening method for covet as it's used so commonly i know this has come up before and discussion i don't know what your opinion is esther yeah my personal opinion and this is not based on on a lot of stories that i review i think it's not that useful in it of itself because even the chances of getting a person with fever at that specific moment is probably relatively small because the fear is not constant it's not 24-hour not everybody has a fever um so um for me it's it's it's not that useful the the only thing that i see it's more of a and especially at the beginning of the epidemic was a behavioral thing that you know by checking your temperature people are more like aware that there's a pandemic out there you know you have to wear your mask you have to tell you're symptomatic if you have other symptoms it's sort of a more a more secondary thing than i'm wondering if there's studies that have shown you know what percentage of people have been detected on you know on the entrance to banks and places with just temperature check i have no idea i think it's probably very low not zero but very low i don't know what marla thinks about yeah i agree i don't i don't think that it's very useful beyond becoming you know a point where a person has to stop um and undergo some sort of screening but i think asking questions about symptoms and exposures is probably a lot more effective than just taking a temperature also those no touch uh temporal thermometers you know i get temperature screened when i come into the office and i don't know if other people have had this experience but you know my temperature varies according to that thermometer somewhere between you know 92 and 98 degrees um you know just depending what the temperature is outside and how close the person is standing to me who's taking um my temperature so i think you know they're sort of of questionable use i don't think you're going to really catch many people who are febrile through that screening who aren't also you know feeling ill or having other symptoms but it can be useful just making a person stop and evaluate their their own um well-being before entering a location thank you uh nestor there's a question where do you think bear satan ab will fit in covet care given the study used it in combination with room desevere and severe ventilated patients and patients not on dexamethasone right i think the indication is going to be just combined with rendezvous because that's the way it was study and for patients who qualify for and decipher which are patients hospitalized patients that require oxygen at least and and obviously this is this drug and rendezvir have been positioned somewhat earlier in the hospitalization as opposed to dexamethasone which is later when when there's uh signs of inflammation uh and more severe disease so i think that's that's the place but to be honest the i mean the the difference was only one day it decreased the hospitalization but one day no impact on mortality and other secondary markers so it's really really really really a modest um a modest uh finding in in the study but you know it got an eua anyway and by the way the wa show is not endorsing rendezvous so for the rest of the world hernandez city is not a it's not a thing as the young people say so it's interesting the controversy so if with no rendezvous nobody's sitting in the rest of the world thank you nestor marla i don't know can you give an update on the new mexico what is what new mexico is doing for vaccination distribution plans just in general sure yeah so we're continuing uh to do a lot of planning we had a tabletop um exercise last week with [Music] community partners and hospitals to start to discuss some of the troubleshooting for distribution um you know once we have an approved vaccine and distribution begins you know we definitely have put protocols in place our you know vaccine plan is available on our cbe.nmhealth.org website um anticipating some additional guidance from cdc after their meeting today with the immunization advisory practices council around prioritization of vaccine our initial allotment of vaccine from pfizer is slated to be only 17 500 doses so not nearly enough to vaccinate all healthcare workers that would fall into that a 1a category or 1a and 1b tiered category for prioritization um so you know hopeful to get more information from them as production ramps up and we have moderna who's now you know submitted their eua as well and so that may change our availability of vaccine but that initial vaccine is going to be the one that requires very low temperature cold storage so that'll be a logistical challenge in distribution and what we anticipate right now is that most of that distribution will happen through our hub hospital partners who have the ability to store vaccine at that temperature and will probably launch vaccine pods that target health care workers in their facilities who are at the highest risk first as we um use that first 17 500 doses which new mexico is slated to get originally we were told it was going to be around 50 000 doses um there's been some recalculation based on population levels so it's looking like 17 500 for new mexico right now um the va and ihs as federal facilities will get an additional separate allotment of vaccine in addition to that 17500 coming to the state from the federal government so more planning is going on additional meetings are scheduled throughout this week to drill down on some of that with uh county emergency managers and other people who will be helping in that distribution marla and that's 17 doses or 17 2 to 2 doses for or 17 health workers 17 000 doses so 17 500 initial doses and then there's supposed to be a second shipment of another 17 500 in time for that second dose 28 days later okay great super helpful thank you so we only have a couple of minutes left i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme link was put into the chat about 12 45 i believe so if you need to see me please use that and also we would love to have your feedback i also just want to apologize because we were not able to get to all of the questions again so you guys have a lot of really really good questions i wanted to also announce that the first responder results the echo was canceled today because of the holiday last week and on thursday there will be a critical care echo with michelle harkins and the topic is going to be monoclonal antibody therapy by sarah madrick one of her colleagues so that should be really great if you want to learn more about monoclonal antibodies then please attend that it's eight to nine on thursday morning and i believe that is it in nestor any other last comments no i just want to congratulate leslie hayes for sharing her experience it was really inspirational and moving and i'm really glad you you made it through uh but thank you for sharing that human part of the we i mean i get caught on all these molecular things but really it's it's it's more amazing that you volunteer to give that information with such uh you know sincerity and honesty so thank you leslie i really enjoy it really really thank you dr appreciate it yeah thank you very much leslie and thank you to thank you marla and carissa and cecilia for coming on and um we'll see you next week bye everybody,,11/30/2020
29,afternoon everyone welcome to the coven 19 office hours we're happy to see everybody today i hope you're having a good day so far um we would for those of you who haven't joined us before we would ask that you turn on your cameras if you have one we would love to see your faces we feel like this helps build community and we can all see each other so so turn on your cameras if you have them and and we appreciate that we would also ask that if you have questions during the about the presentations or anything that's discussed in the echo please put it into the chat box and we'll go we'll try to get all the questions answered that we have time for um and we would also ask that you refrain from from answering those questions in the chat box unless they're directly unless they're directed at you specifically so uh we have a couple of um other just a couple other announcements if we have a digital librarian on today and he'll be putting uh information into the chat box during the entire session so please keep an eye on that there's a lot of great resources that go into that as well and without further ado i'm going to introduce um our hub panel i'd like to introduce my colleague joanna katzman joanna do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself thanks carla hi everyone i'm joanna at katzman i'm a neurologist i work with carla project deco and at the unm pain center welcome great thank you and we have both mr sosa and leslie hayes and nestor i'm just going to have you go ahead and start and introduce yourself and then we'll go to leslie okay thank you my name is natural salsa an infectious disease division chief here at the university of new mexico hospital let me share my screen perfect can you see my screen good okay so let's start the update for today for december 7. so we all know that the vaccines are coming the vaccines are coming and i wanted to share with you a couple of notes first of all there was the publication by the advisory committee on immunization practices it was published in the mmwr for those interested in seeing some of the rationale behind the the group the first group which is basically healthcare workers especially those um in direct contact with covet patients and and nursing home residents are the first going to be vaccinated this paper sort of uh explains the conclusions of the of the um acip meeting so i encourage those who want to read it to read it um one of the publications one of the probably most important publication recently on on vaccines was the long-term data on the phase one of moderna modern as you know is one of the rna vaccines probably one of the the two that are going to be approved before the end of the year so they published in the new england journal just a couple of days ago their um the duration of the response uh to to their vaccine which is formerly called mrna1273 and without going into a lot of detail this is a small study with 34 uh participant 34 volunteers it was their their early phase study and you can see these are the graph of the different levels of antibodies these are the the rbd antibodies and you can see that you know people now on a response especially after the second dose and that response those antibody levels seems to be sustaining time so at least and this goes all the way to four months 119 days so that's very encouraging we know that the immunity induced by the vaccine is sustained uh some some like specific antibodies like neutralizing antibodies uh may fall in some other places but again the the half-life is pretty long at least more than probably it's going to last more than six months maybe even up to a year so those are good news obviously we need more long-term follow-up but it's uh the conclusion and the and the analysis and the comments of the of the editors and scientists that i have heard from these papers that is encouraging news that the the immunity induced by this mrna vaccine um it's not short-lived it seems to be uh long-lasting and that's that's uh important uh the other the other paper that i review has to do with transmission kinetics and it's a very well designed story uh from the epidemic in china and and uh in which they they actually it was published in science by this group of investigators from china in which they they actually described the the transmission kinetics um and controllability of such kobe 2 with the intervention that they did and in fact they study a thousand hundred and seventy eight sars kobe patients and their contacts and they they studied how many of their contacts got infected they had up to fifteen thousand six hundred and forty closed contacts of this of these patients um for a total of 19 000 um separate exposure in in the in the in the hunan's uh provincial center for disease control there in in their in that area they identified 210 epidemical clusters 831 uh secondary cases and some sporadic cases and the important conclusion of this paper is in this graph which i'm going to explain this actually in this circle what you see all dots all of the dots that you see are people with uh with the sarcoby2 infection and then you can see some chains of transmission which is basically these points um united with a line so as you can see there are many many points which have no points connected to that means that people who did not infected other uh other contacts and there are yes like um you know 15 to 20 percent of people who actually infect it and they and you can see those that infected infected several um of their close contacts so the conclusion of this of this study was or something that we knew that the transmit the transvisibility of the disease is very heterogeneous in fact 80 of the infections can be traced back to 15 of the affected individuals so there was another you know um 65 70 percent of people who actually did not infect anybody and you can see it in in the graph in the bar graph um close to 80 percent of people did not infect or infect zero zero or have zero secondary infection and then the the the secondary infection were produced by by a minority of patients uh so that was interesting in the way they they describe and and prove this something that we have already commented in this that the transmission it's really heterous that's why you sometimes you say well i was infected and nobody in my home got infected how could that be because the transmission is very heterogeneous and there could be one person in a party infects 20 other and in fact they found the largest cluster was 20 individual and the range of secondary cases uh was between zero and ten the other the other phenomenon that was observed in this in this study was how things change in china before and after the lockdown and you can see for instance the transmission to household contact the ultra ratio of transmission increased before the lockdown it was two after the lockdown a ratio of 3.79 almost four four four times the ratio um and that was the only one that increased all of the other transmission like extended family members social context and community went down and you can see from one to 0.94 63 to 4.1 37 to 20 meaning that that yeah you need less outside the home but there's some more transmission inside the home because you are obviously not working you are at home you are with your relatives so that also points out the importance of of having some infection control measures when you have or or you're taking care of a of a relative recovery 19. so i thought it was a very elegant and very detailed study out of china the other study from investigators in the u.s and we have been talking about these you might recall at the beginning of the epidemic that people thought that weather change was gonna um affect the transmission all these investigators have taken data um from throughout the year here in the united states of temperature um rain ultraviolet light and correlated with the transmission of kobe 19 adjusting for some uh intervention variables it's a very complicated uh science then study but i can i can give you the conclusion was that yes cold temperature or or low temperature and they use 52 fahrenheit as as a cutoff it is associated with increased transmission but this association is not very strong and obviously other factors like mask wearing social distancing mobility um affect but there's definitely you know a relationship and you can see they actually model if if you if you um if you have a warm temperature and it it goes on for several days these are days on the on the uh x axis you can see that there's a difference between them the number of cases per million that are expected and the lower the temperature um the higher the number of cases so there's definitely uh this inverse relationship between temperature and number of cases according to these uh investigators so something that is interesting but it's obviously not definitive and in fact their conclusion was that the incidence of disease declines with increased temperature um and it's lower in warmer versus cooler temperature and that can be in part an explanation for this this enormous uh rise that we see in the in the in the number of cases especially in the northern hemisphere but again this association is small and transmission is likely to remain high even at higher temperatures if people do not implement all of the other public health measures another interesting paper on vitamin d and we have i have discussed in this um forum um a couple of paper there was a small paper from spain if you remember they gave it high they gave high dose of vitamin d to very sick kobe patients and they saw a mortality benefit there was also story out of of the uk in which they have values of vitamin d levels before the the pandemic and then they they evaluated the clinical course absorbed with low and high vitamin d and and there was a association between low vitamin and a more severe disease so this study was out of india uh it was published in the scientific uh reports of of nature and it's the title is analysis of vitamin d level among asymptomatic and critically kobe patients what they did they actually grouped the patients um that they were seeing in in their hospital in in india into a group a which were patients asymptomatic 91 asymptomatic patients consecutive patients and they they hospitalize this asymptomatic patient just for isolation it was sort of a hospital hotel isolation so they were essentially coming positive by pcr but asymptomatic and they call that group group a and group b were patients in icu essentially patient with respiratory failure and and critically ill secondary to covet and also pcr positive and then they they um they look into their inflammatory markers and and vitamin d the the groups were slightly different obviously the asymptomatic patients uh were uh slightly younger 10 years younger 42 versus 51 um and and but when they look at the vitamin levels vitamin d levels specifically they found that those asymptomatic patients have had a higher um mean uh um level of vitamin d compared to those who were sick who have 14 so there was apparently this this um difference in the levels of vitamin d in the more severe patients and to have lower and this was highly studied or was statistically significant and then they they did they um classify the patients by international levels of vitamin d they have deficiency or not uh and i think they use the cutoff of 20 and you seen that cut off you can see that in the group a um a relatively small percentage of patients have deficiency of vitamin d but then when you look at the really sick patients almost um 80 or 90 percent have deficiency of vitamin d so so it's another study that is associating uh low levels of vitamin d with with a severe coping we still need a prospective control trial of vitamin d to see if it really works but it was an interesting interesting finding and in fact the conclusion was very strong i i i think we all we can conclude from this story was that there is an association between low levels of vitamin d the answer we copy but i'm i'm not um ready to say that that taking vitamin d will make your coffee go away or or or it's a therapeutic intervention because they didn't do this on on this trial but it's another another uh study associating um vitamin d with with severe calorie and and the the next paper that i'm going to mention it's it's an animal paper but i'm presenting it because we are going to be studying this medication called mood no pita beer in the next couple of days we're going to start two trials at unm so i sort of want to familiarize everybody with this when you um hear about this this product this is this is a so-called uh mk4482 now it's the name it's mono piravir it's similar to rendezvous in the sense that it inhibits rna proliferation but the big difference or is that it's an oral drug it's something that we can we can give orally has good uh bioavailability by mouth so they publish the studies in ferrets ferrets as you know it's it's is one of those uh animal models that are that we are able to infect in the lab uh and and and study and when they did first they they proved that this drug the monopilabi or mk44 82 decrease the viral replication at concentrations around 10 um 10 to 1 you can see how precipitously the the the number of of buyers the viral fighter falls so it's it's active in vitro that was the first step the second thing that they did is that they um they they proved that they can infect uh ferrets with with sars so this is this is the normal um days that the the ferrets uh shed buyers and you can see that all the way to day six or seven um these ferrets infected with the high dose of virus shed virus and then the next step in this experiment was to actually treat these these ferrets with with with mk44 and you're going to see and this is the graph that basically shows the different um [Music] arms of therapy black is the infection without any treatment with just vehicle drugs so no drug is the placebo to put it in a in a human way so they gave the vehicle and you can see that the viral excretion lasts um for several days in these ferrets and then when they're treated 12 hours after the inoculation you can see how rapidly it is a yellow and blue curve how rapidly the viral low goes down with the the blue and the yellow doses which is five milligram per kilo 15 milligram per kilogram um at 12 hour post infection and then 36 hour plus infection so starting a little bit late so this is the moment when they give the drug there's also a marked decrease in the in the viral tires in the in the first faster than obviously vehicles so so they showed that they were able to to decrease the presence of virus in these animals these animals do not develop severe disease so there's no like survival or or or long um ct scans or or mris of the lung to show improvement because they they have sort of an almost asymptomatic or pulsy symptomatic disease and then the other experiment that they did i'm going to skip this one is that they actually put treated uh ferrets with with uh untreated ferrous treated infected ferrous with untreated furs and vehicle treated ferrets with um on twitter first in the same case to see if they could prevent transmission and and essentially it did the the first that were treated um um did not transmit to the other to the other animals and illustrated in this graph those who were treated um the the contact ferrets were not infected uh so so it not only decreased the viral load in the ferret but it prevented transmission which is something that that may be attractive also for for human epidemic um so so this drug definitely works on decreasing the viral load and decreasing transmission in these animal experiments we're obviously about to start um phase two three trials uh with this product which uh it's america um oral antiviral and finally i just want to show you i always bring a cool a picture the this this photo is actually an electron photograph of the nasal mucosa you you have asked a lot about the sense of smell what is the mechanism this um investigator from uh from germany actually did 33 autopsies in patients who died of kobe and and they did different immunofluorescence but they took a picture of the nasal mucosa you can see the the respiratory cilia here and these are the cells and all these little structures are viruses both extra cellular and intracellular and this is intra cellular in the mucosa you can see that they make the image bigger and bigger and you can see the typical um viral particles with the spike proteins uh proving that in fact there is infection of the of the olfactory mucosa and probably this is what is causing the loss of sense of smell actually this paper in nature neuroscience actually look into invasion of the cns so it was more more complicated but i just wanted to bring this uh photo showing the the proof at least the photographic proof that the nasal mucosa is invaded by these sars cov2 virus and and just to finish two two uh nice articles one um uh policing jama about graphic medicine uh the best of 2020 actually shows some cartoons and illustration very nice uh and most of them are related to the pandemic so i i encourage people to look into this paper and actually click on the links and go into the into the cartoons or or um all the graphic material that they have they're really uh something different and and and some of the cartoons were really moving really interesting about how um graphic artists actually uh perceive and interpret the epidemic very nice and then sort of a review paper what we have learned and the question remaining regarding kobe 19 was published a couple of days ago in clinical infection this is for those who have access to this journal it's an interesting because they have a table of all the lessons learned and another table on the question remaining or the things that we still have to clarify with this um pandemic so i thought it was very very informative paper and this is one of the one of the cartoons which i love i actually i mean it takes a while to read it but i'll invite you to look at the at these um in the graphic medicine in jama which was really really interesting one of these cartoons really really fun so that's i'll start sharing here and go to the question thank you thank you very much nestor um i'm gonna go ahead and go to leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself and get and and proceed with your presentation leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine with el centro family health in espanola and hang on just a second [Music] um shoot where is my well you're looking for it i'm going to have chris introduce yourself and just see if she has any updates and then we'll come back to you carissa can you introduce yourself hi chris culbreth i'm medical director for infectious disease diagnostics at tri-core reference labs and no no updates for today but happy to take on any testing related questions great thank you all right can you guys see my uh powerpoint yes yes you can all right so i was going to talk just a little bit about anasmian egyptia um and i've actually turned around time for testing i've been interested in anastasmia for a long time because my husband his father and um his nephew all three of them have congenital anesmia so i've been uh reading about this the whole time we've been married and i will say that the covet and osmia and ajucia are just not well studied despite having really a huge effect on quality of life and so when you go to fill out the little evaluation form at the end and it says was there evidence presented you're going to have to say no because i actually could not find any evidence especially on treatment um despite the fact i really did look but there has been a lot on a lot of the covert groups i'm on with kind of anecdotal things that people say really worked and i just wanted to mention those so just some definitions anaosmia means you can't smell anything at all hyposmia means you have a decreased sense of smell pear osmia is an altered sense of smell and people will say for instance chocolate smells like burning rubber h ucf means you can't taste it all i don't know how i got smell in there you can't taste it all with a juicia and then this juicia is things taste weird so and there was a paper last month in scientific american where they were talking a little bit about the anosmia and one of the suggestions they made that um it might actually be more useful as a screening test than temperature checks it's far more likely to affect asymptomatic patients and be the only symptom that people have um some studies suggest it affects up to 80 percent um others were a little bit lower about 45 percent i don't know how well you could smell through a mask but i think it would be more useful than a temperature screen and um dr was just talking about how it support attacks the support cells in the stem cells and does not directly affect the neurons and it is different from the usual upper respiratory infection where the usual cause of anosmia is just nasal congestion and then um uh the an article from the guardian they'd interviewed a couple people with um some smell thing uh smell centers and again they said between 44 and 77 percent of covet patients experienced complete loss of smell during the compute phase of their illness and one study of hospitalized coveted patients found that um only about two-thirds had recovered their normal smell function within six to eight weeks and about five to ten percent actually have a serious impairment um so total or near total loss of smell even at two months and um it can be a very frustrating symptom for a lot of people and agencia this is an article on taste loss in a nutrition journal and it seems to affect especially sweet and bitter and it's important to notice that covid related dejucia is actually loss of taste most of the time loss of taste related to a cold is due to loss of smell secondary to it this is actually primary loss of taste and this can actually be associated with significant waste weight loss and malnutrition um people on some cova groups um these are physician covid groups um that i'm on um have said that they've lost 35 pounds because they just have no interest in food um one thing that this article mentioned is that you have to watch people maybe actually taking in too much salt as they try to get flavor and my husband has always been very into textures of foods and colors he pays far more attention to that and he he doesn't have any problem with taste but because of his lack of smell he is much more interested in texture of food um than most people are and most of these safety issues and other issues i actually am bringing up from having lived with somebody for 25 years with anosmia food safety is actually very important um one family story is that my um mother-in-law and father-in-law got married and my mother-in-law was working a job she really loved and my father-in-law went to make dinner one night and cooked some rotten food and got very sick and he insisted that his wife quit her job and stay home and cook for him after that so very important to follow food safety guidelines always important but especially if you can't smell and to watch expiration dates and to put the little stickers if you open a a container and put it in the fridge or put leftovers in the fridge put a sticker on with the date that it goes in there um follow recipes for spices my husband apparently before he married me was cooking for his girlfriend and decided a whole head of garlic would be better than just a couple cloves and she had to leave the house because the whole house smelled and the food was inedible natural gas leaks are an important issue and so making sure that the gas safety is there personal hygiene issues can be a really big deal for people if they can't smell and especially for people who live alone um can worry a lot about it um social withdrawal is very common with anosmian something to really be aware of and caution with scented products i know we've all known the elderly woman um who has the decreased sense of smell and puts on lots and lots of perfume so warn people to be very cautious with scented products and then smell training and this is one that has absolutely no evidence behind it but at least half a dozen people um uh on my physician group have said that this has actually worked wonders for them it won't work for complete anosmia but it may be helpful for either hyposmia or perosmia and again i can't find any data on it this site www.absent.org has some information on how to do the smell training basically you need a smell training kit and um they do it with essential oils all you need basically are four different things that have very strong odors they use rose lemon clove and eucalyptus you can choose whatever odors you want they said to sit somewhere quiet and basically you open the jars one in a row and smell them and try and think about the smell and it helps to somehow re-establish the connection to the brain and um uh like i said people who have done it have said it actually has really made a big difference for them and then for the loss of taste there is this berry called miracle fruit and it has not been studied at all that i can find for covid related loss of taste but it has been studied with chemotherapy and it'll work better for partial loss of taste or disc juicia but it apparently really enhances taste and it makes sour taste sweet and if you have low level of taste it will really enhance the flavor of the food and again i could not find any data on it but several people have said it made a big difference on their ability to eat so some and you can actually buy tablets of it you don't have to buy the berries you can buy tablets of it there's at least half a dozen different brands on amazon when i looked and then this was an interesting article and spiegel and tux who i believe are both economists did a research paper and then they did a paper in a lay journal yale insights and if you want to look it up i would look up the late paper because i'll tell you the math on the actual research paper was really hard to understand and they looked at various counties often in the same state and compared the count and this was for states that had no state policy just county by county and they saw which policy interventions that the states passed seemed to make things better and they really stressed that all many of the available interventions do work but masks stood out both because they were extremely effective they decreased the fatality rate by about 12 percent compared to a place that didn't do masks and there was also a relative lack of economic trade-offs with masks and they did mention it has to be a mandatory mask policy um and they said recommending masks really doesn't do much it really does need to be a mandatory mask policy some other things that predicted declines in future fatality growth stay-at-home orders really seem to make a difference beach and park closures and that actually doesn't make much sense because beaches and parks are outside and they said possibly it's because people tend to socialize and have parties at beaches and at parks and they thought the other thing is if you close the national parks people are coming in from out of state and so you decrease the number of people coming in from out of state restaurant closures definitely made a difference and then they said high-risk business closures and i looked throughout the article and i could not find exactly what they defined as high-risk businesses and um i don't know if there's a standard definition somewhere that i missed but they did say some things that are actually counterproductive one was closing low-risk retail businesses such as bookstores and clothing stores and they think the reason is is that when everything was closed that people tended towards higher risk activities like spending time indoors with friends so you don't want to shut down things that have a very low risk of infection because then you're going to actually possibly push people into higher risk things the other thing and this totally makes sense as they said limiting gatherings to 100 guests is actually counterproductive because then people feel like oh i'll just have 98 of my friends over and we'll still be below 100 and the state says that is safe and then this is just an article from washington post on some inequalities and testing and i just thought it was kind of interesting and frustrating and they were noticing since august when the nfl training camps the nfl has conducted nearly 700 000 coronavirus tests in one week they administered 43 000 tests to almost 8 000 players coaches and employees major college football programs supply dozens of tests each day in soccer does nearly 5 000 tests a week and major league baseball conducted 170 000 tests during its season but in the meantime many registered nurses are unable to get testing through their employer last month registered nurses gathered in los angeles and ucla that week had conducted 1248 tests on their athletes and healthcare workers at ucla were not allowed to get testing through their employer they had to go get it through their own private physician or through the doh or anything like that they could not get it through their employer and national nurses united the country's largest nursing union did a survey of their 15 000 members and about two-thirds report that they had never been tested which i just found kind of astonishing and i would like to pause to give a special shout out to my organizational central family health um el centro has provided testing since the beginning for any employee who is concerned or even just wants to get tested and they've routinely anytime there's been an exposure tested everyone in the building to be on the safe side which is what i think healthcare organizations should be doing um some other interesting articles um jeffrey siegelman is a physician who is a covert 19 long-hauler and he wrote a piece in jama that i thought was quite good and then there was a piece in new york times this week natural immunity from covet is not safer than vaccine talking about the vaccine and natural immunity and how they work um this article from medium was excellent on the mrna vaccines and how they work it's something that you could easily refer your non-medical colleagues to if they want to read up on them explains why they're safe and how they should work and then the last one was just kind of fun it's from new england journal and they had five different covid patients one with mild disease moderate severe critical and then expert i did the mild patient and basically you order tests and put in interventions and you'll be happy to hear that the mild patient survived through to the end of the simulation when i did it so but anyway it was it was kind of fun might be worth doing and then the last thing next week instead of talking about articles i would like to actually have people um contact me and there are many things about cobit that have been awful but i think we all have things that we have learned from kova that is like you know what this was actually very useful and i want to continue doing this for me the two that immediately popped to mind i've mentioned several times telehealth and how very helpful i think having telehealth around is and then the second thing is i realized i was not cleaning my stethoscope nearly enough um prior to covet and i think i will hopefully continue that afterwards and so i will put my email address and my phone you can text me or you can email me but i would love to hear things that you have found useful from koba that you're going to continue doing after covid and that is all i have thank you so much leslie for those really great great information um so i just want to encourage everyone to put their questions into the chat if you have them and it doesn't have to be about these specific presentations either anything that you're that you want to know more about it that you have questions about please put it into the chat and i'm going to turn it over to to joanna to start with our questions thanks carla um thanks nestor thanks leslie thank you all for being on the line and being so attentive um i want to start with some questions and actually reiterate what carla said please put in any questions you have in the chat regarding anything regarding to vaccines or testing or anything that's on your mind um this first question is from philip hertzman he says uh are there any studies related to the effectiveness of mass advertisers having nano silver or copper oxide threads etc any evidence that these materials inactivate the virus um do you know nestor do you know about that no i just remember just to refresh a recollection that one of the materials in which the virus lasts less it's copper it was one of the those that that you know were a few hours as opposed to days uh but that's that was in the lab not in a mask and actually like a metal plate where they put the virus so so but but i haven't seen anything specific on on the on copper mask or or any or nanoparticles either thank you nestor um uh lynn colemeyer are you on video or are you able to unmute and ask your question dr colmeira um i i'm driving so i'm not gonna take off my cam put my camera on but i can ask my question um i think you can see it in the chat about what what do we tell a young um 30 year old worker outside not really within 20 feet of anybody and ellen i was there for another reason and saw he was not wearing a mask and say that they're going to fire him if he doesn't wear a matter thanks dr kohlmeyer so it's a young gentleman who's never had any kind of legal claims against him who's it sounds like his uh it sounds like there's a mass mandate either in his state or and or with his job um and he's uh kind of not wanting to wear a mask um any uh maybe i'll start with nest yeah i would add that um yeah we're in washington um and i know there are you know some new restrictions but he's his work is incredibly intense and i'm sure he'd probably be fine wearing a math but um you know but but it would be very difficult he's always outside and he's never within 10 feet of anybody otherwise you would wear a mask in those situations of course gotcha nestor leslie do you want to comment on that thanks dr colemayer no i mean i i it's just an issue although the the he seems not to be close to anybody i i guess at some points people will approach him or you know if somebody wants to ask him something in the work or something so that's what i think even in under those um unusual conditions wearing a mask makes sense because at some point somebody's gonna you know get to him and talk to him and and if he's an asymptomatic spreader he can infect that person or vice versa the person can infect him so um you know it's sort of sort of an extraordinary circumstance in which he's always outside he's always listening from other people but i think uh you know out of discipline if everybody wears a mask it's probably easier from a public health uh policy but that's my personal opinion not based on any on anything thanks nestor and leslie yeah i would agree with nestor even though it's unlikely um to cause transmission um we have a one of my colleagues had a patient just this week who um her only source of um contact with the outside world was uh someone who she had a 10-minute conversation with outside and she ended up getting covered from it so it can happen less likely does not mean won't happen thank you leslie there's a another question from trevor um hawkins um he says there's no real downside to vitamin d supplementation so maybe should we be recommending it to everybody at risk leslie do you want to answer that um the one downside to vitamin d supplementation if you get your levels too high it can contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation so i i might consider um i think everybody should be on i think it's 800 units of vitamin d a day for osteoporosis prevention if you're going to do higher doses than that you might want to get a level check before you start it just make sure you're not at the higher end leslie this is joanna if if the level is below normal then how much would you recommend for a kind of re-supplementation i have never actually found an answer to that i generally start at 5000 units a day and recheck in three to six months to see where they are um but i've never found a specific study looking at that or anything like that but um 5000 units a day in rechecking seems to work fairly well so that's what i do i do 5000 units and recheck in a month or two um there's another question thanks leslie from adelia munoz is there a link between covid and hsv1 um nester do you have any have you seen any links between that any relation no no i haven't okay um and then jonas uh pologue says any updates on the uh vaccine from russia have you seen any articles about that or any news no the news is that they are they started um vaccinating like priority groups in in russia over the last couple of days uh there's no um apparently they they're not doing the phase three they're just going ahead and or at least have not published the phase three we only have the phase one two study and and then they went directly into into mass vaccination that that's all i know and it started a couple of days ago because i saw the news and and the videos of people getting the vaccine in moscow and just to remind the you know the vaccine that the russia vaccine sputnik uh v or sputnik 5 is essentially an adenovirus vaccine they use two different adenoviruses human adenoviruses the first time and the second time to prevent immunity to the adenovirus it's in some regards similar to the chimpanzee adenovirus that astral seneca is using so it's a it's a viral vector vaccine or an mrna or a protein vaccine is actually a viral vector similar to the astral seneca oxford vaccine thanks nestor i think isn't the johnson johnson vaccine also an adenovirus uh made from an adenovirus yes i think so thanks nestor um there's a couple questions from dr hayes and also dr cindy johnson the first is from dr hayes leslie do you want to ask your question about the um antibodies so i was just curious um you mentioned last week that about five percent of people who have coveted don't develop antibodies is that going to be a problem with um you know their immune system not recognizing the proteins so they won't develop it with the vaccine as well or is it um likely related to something else in the vaccine will work just fine right i mean i don't think we know uh we know that the virus in in the process of of infecting a person fights the immune system i mean it has it has proteins that actually degrade the interferon uh intermediaries so so my hope is that that five percent once they see a purified protein like like in the case of using mrna or an adjuvanted vaccine may have an immune response but we don't know we don't know if those people who do not uh the the viral proteins are going to recognize the vaccine protein because it is devoid of the all of the other inhibitory uh factors that the virus has when when it infects a cell i think we need to we need to see and and and in fact it's interesting to see the efficacy was 95 in those vaccines so i wonder if that five percent are people who do not mound an antibody but we'll see when we get the phase three results and the immunogenicity and see what percentage of people actually react to the to the to the vaccines we'll learn more about that thanks nestor um i wanted to ask you a question about patients who've had covet you know many many months ago um should they be receiving the vaccine this was from rick rick foster right that that's a good question and um in some of the studies in the protocol that i have reviewed they actually asked the patient if they had copied but they didn't measure baseline antibodies so i'm sure uh they're just indeed in those twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand volunteers that have participated in the phase three studies uh there's gonna be us you know probably five percent three percent of people who actually got kobe before and were vaccinated so we're gonna see what happens if they have any type of of uh of worse outcome less immune response more immune response i think we're going to learn that when when they publish the the the experience of the of the studies because i know that we we have vaccinated in the clinical trials people who have covered in the first wave and then they presented for vaccination in uh later in the year so we'll learn about that too when we look at the the different subgroups of people have been vaccinated my bias or my my way of thinking is that the vaccine is going to be a booster if anything if there is no disease enhancement like it happens with dengue which is a bad thing that you get a disease and it's worse when you're vaccinated if that doesn't happen the the most likely scenario is that it's going to be a booster that you're gonna you your memory cells are gonna remember the spike protein and when it gets into your body by via a pector or via mrna uh you're gonna have a robust immune reaction but that's that's just what i'm hoping is more hopeful uh or wishful thinking that that than you know we haven't seen anything on data but i think that's that's what's going to happen if we don't have the the antibiotic enhancement disease which is what we fear but there's no evidence of that so far thank you nestor and that was a similar question uh pamela defern asked that a similar question to that as well so thanks nestor for that cindy johnson wants to know about um the monoclonal antibody uh treatments and are we kind of moving in that direction in new mexico and i think dr parata is now now has a clinic at unm uh with in terms of that can you speak to that nestor yeah that is correct last week uh in the medical arts building uh not not really in in around the hospital but a little bit further uh to the west in the medical arts building where there's other dermatology rehab and other and other clinics they have set up an infusion center in the same area where they take care of patients with kobe that that have been discharged from the hospital um and so they have a few infusion uh shares there and they they they actually started giving the monoclonal last week i i haven't really checked with them how many doses have been administered but i knew there was one on that tuesday was the first patient um so yeah so we have started giving the eli lily product the bam bam la nimiba which is should the clinicians on this line be referring patients uh to this clinic if if appropriate yeah there's a mechanism i'm not aware of all the details but i know that patients uh over 65 or who had a who have a very high bmi or 55 years old with with risk factors um if they're diagnosed they should be referred the other thing is the the it has to be referred soon i mean the therapy is given i think less than than three or four days after the the test so if a person was diagnosed a week ago it's probably too late because it's already mounting its own antibody response so so yeah i mean i'll i promise i'll find out how the referral is but i i i know it's there's a mechanism for primary care physicians emergency room physicians if they identify patients who send them to the to this uh clinic for for um for that i'm going to get the phone number and find out how can you refer patients sounds good and um maybe if i can find it too maybe we can elena martinez might be able to send it out to everyone as well nestor um just wanted to let everybody know the slides are elena sent out the slides um just a few minutes ago uh the cme should be out momentarily and just wanted to also let you know marla sievers will be on the um call next week and she's going to be talking um more specifically about vaccines uh coming to new mexico next week as well as that was a question from fred fox um about how vaccines are going to be allocated to new mexico i'm sure everybody's going to be interested in hearing about that so carla back to you um we have many more questions to get to thanks everybody thank you very much um i also know i was just going to say that it wasn't i mean in the paper today they were talking about the presbyterian um is now also offering that i don't know if anyone is on from press or could give information about that because i think they're doing the same thing at presbyterian as well um the let's see um jeff miller do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question jeffrey are you oh there you are there you go jeff miller in family practice in albuquerque uh i was i was just wondering if at unm has there been any starting of rationing care related to the limitation of medical resources and if not what what sort of procedures are set up by with the ethics committee or otherwise given that there's a reasonable expectation we may be faced with that problem that's a that's a great question i'll tell you what i know uh we have set up first a therapeutic committee to try to to streamline all the guidelines uh and and actually revise some of the guidance uh news on rendezvous marie city the monochronol so so we have said of that and and i heard the department um our the chair of the department of medicine dr ingrew has also called for like uh to create a committee for the uh crisis standard of care so to to help uh clinicians with difficult decisions if we get to the point that we have to decide uh the use of ventilators or beds or or therapy so so they are working on that the elc the emergency uh committee is actually uh getting that into into action i don't know if they have already uh you know started meeting and discussing a specific situation but i know that that have been discussed since last week when we saw the big um increase and the percentage of of of patients outside of the icu et cetera so yeah so it is definitely uh happening um or will happen very soon at the university hospital thank you nestor um chris maybe you can just comment on antibody testing in general but there's a specific question within a family cluster with children and various positive covid um people are covet positive what is the role of antibody testing and those who are asymptomatic or negative yes i think that's an interesting question right i think the um we should always go back to what are we looking for the um test to tell us um the you know we know that um we have not in the past used the antibody test as a test of immunity and so i think those who are in the household if they've been tested their pcr negative if they continue to be close contacts and they continue to if they begin to exhibit any symptoms they should certainly be retested and then those who are out in the community no matter what your covet status is whether or not you've had the infection previously or exhibit antibodies should continue to wear mask and social distance and and all of those things um so so other than satisfying the curiosity of family transmission i would not recommend using any antibody testing of continued asymptomatic individuals as nester mentioned previously the vaccine is still going to be distributed to people who have been previously infected and whether or not your antibody positive shouldn't change the social interaction pieces that we know help to mitigate spread so it's not something that i would recommend certainly satisfies some curiosity but not anything i would at all recommend at this time thank you super helpful chris will i have you i'm going to ask one more question um fred fox i had the question that you previously mentioned your lab was evaluating some of the rapid uh point of care pcr platforms are you can you talk a little bit about what's going on with that i'm sure our laboratory is currently supporting testing using the roche liat system which is a rapid point of care pcr test and that test has a documented limit of detection very similar to the in-house big box laboratory tests can detect very very small levels of virus and so that's a little bit different from the isothermal type of test from the abbott id now so abbott id now though molecular is is not quite as sensitive and so that testing is limited to only symptomatic populations and so not all rapid molecular tests are created equal definitely consider the id now a little bit more similar to your rapid antigen test and treat it in a very similar way the roche liat is highly sensitive and so that can be treated more like a standard laboratory molecular test and carla i have an update from from alicia barrata chi tiger text me that i asked her the question you guys asked me uh so so she says that for unm provider there's an ad hoc in cerner so if you're you're an unm provider and you're seeing a patient with that you think it may qualify for the limit you can you can ad hoc or request the therapy through the through the emr and they also they're not taking outside referrals except for uh patients from first choice first nations and igss ihs sorry indian health service and um and the phone number for those who who are within those uh restrictions is 925 6212 okay and that's that's the clinic but as as i said it's restricted to unm providers first choice first nations and iahs okay great thank you nestor and i'm not sure if anyone knows the answer to this but pamela duffin daphne sorry was asking is the hospital at home initiated by the cms by cms last week the reason for starting the infusion clinics that are affiliated with hospitals providers are paid at inpatient rates do you know any anything about that no not really and i think it's a separate because the e way for the for the monoclonal specifically says outside the hospital so the reimbursement is is an outpatient and and the opposite was rendezvous rendezvous we haven't been able to keep it at homes or or in in facilities because it's it's was given to the university this is my understanding for inpatient in-hospital uh administration and building and we are actually discussing if we can discharge somebody with with uh with uh who's who hasn't finished it's five days or ten days or in this year and we haven't been able to do that we have to either discontinue the rendezvous or or or keep them in-house to complete the five days because of those restrictions great thank you thank you very much um let's see we only have a couple more minutes any pressing questions here you know i'm not gonna um the question about the vaccine availability i think we'll wait till next week because marla said she's there they were having a meeting with the cdc today actually and she's gonna bring all of that information to us next week regarding vaccine availability and distribution in new mexico so i think on the 10th it's going to be on the 10th is going to be the committee that is going to discuss uh and i think they're going to they're going to broadcast that meeting so i i mean i'm on service on that day but i would love to see and hear the the data from the phrase three from the fisa first three and see what the the scientists in the committee actually asked pfizer so if you guys have you know time free time and you can find the link it's probably gonna be out of the fda um and that they i'm almost sure they're gonna they're gonna broadcast the that meeting in which they actually discuss the data and and and you know and vote on on giving the the approval or not to the to to the pfizer vaccine so that that's going to be interesting it's going to be on the 10th thank you thank you very much nestor and i just wanted to um introduce winona beakley she's a nurse up in santa fe who's a colleague of ours and she may come in in the near future and tell us about what they're doing up there at um but now do you want to um introduce yourself and just talk about room design for a minute i apologize i've got a new computer it's not allowing the camera um i'm monoavikle with access research group up here in santa fe and just coming back to what you were mentioning earlier nestor we will be offering um probably later this week or early next week rem de severe in a clinical setting in a clinical trial setting for outpatient use and so um very similar it's exact same dosing except a shorter course of therapy three infusions and so maybe next week when we have a little more time and dr gorgos is available as well uh we could do just a quick update on which therapies we will have available great thank you maybe you can just put your contact information into the into the chat as well i will do that right now all right um thank you very much everyone we just have a couple of minutes left i wanted to announce that um uh we do have two other cova 19 clinics um here at unm one is on uh critical care which is the first and the third thursday so we won't have one this week but next week michelle harkins will be having her critical care clinic and she doesn't have a um she doesn't we don't know what the presentation is going to be yet but but it's always very very interesting we talked about monoclonal antibodies last week and um joanna do you know the what's about to um the first responder what's happening today uh i'm not exactly sure about the topic but it's usually about uh mental health uh burnout or self-care resiliency and related to covid it's been folks all over the country national expert in mental health and resiliency it's at two o'clock mountain time uh today every monday um as usual so that's today and then um every thursday from 12 to one on alternate weeks there's a mental health and there's another mental health and resiliency alternating with the substance use and chronic pain echo as as well excellent thank you yeah the topic today for the resiliency is um how will things get better individual and organizational strategies for promoting optimal coping and enhanced performance during the coven 19 pandemic thank you sounds like a very important subject yes so thank you everyone for joining and we look forward to seeing you next week and if you if you need cme please fill the cme out and we would just we would love to have your feedback as well also send me information on what you have found beneficial i'd really love to hear from you i posted it to a physician group on facebook and the responses have been so interesting and i'd love to hear what particularly in new mexico people are finding beneficial thank you all thank you bye-bye [Music] uh like you,,12/7/2020
30,everybody can you hear me okay great thank you well welcome everybody to our monday office hours infectious disease echo i'm joanna katzman i want to get started right away and wanted to remind everybody that if you have a video camera and you're able to turn it on please do so it allows us to be able to see you and we can kind of see each other and it's uh more bi-directional and in line with the echo model that would be fantastic i would like to introduce my colleague carla thornton carla do you want to say hi sure thank you joanna i'm carla thornton infectious diseases here at unm thank you thanks carlin carla will be asking some questions a little in a little bit but i want to get right to we have presentations from our leader dr nester sosa who's the division chief of infectious diseases at university of new mexico um dr sosa has a presentation uh followed by that of leslie hayes and then we've got a great update from marla sivers who's one of the senior epidemiologists at the new mexico department of health um so without further ado i just wanted to let everybody know that we also have a our digital librarian kent noseworthy who's going to be putting many things in the chat and just wanted to remind everybody please do not hesitate if you have any questions um you know burning questions during the presentations from either dr sosa dr hayes or marla sivers please uh please put that in the chat so that you don't forget so dr sosa we are ready thank you thank you hello everyone let me see if i can share my screenplay in presentation mode can you see my screen really well good okay so really an exciting day for for the united states there as you know they're starting the vaccinations so i decided today to review the data the published data of the pfizer vaccine which is the one that that hopefully some of the healthcare workers and nursing home residents and employees will receive in the next few days and actually there was a lot of discussion last last week at the with the fda meeting but but we uh we're lucky to see that they publish their their data um in the new england journal on the 10th so we have access to the to the complete publication besides the report so this this trial was actually the the phase three trial with some safety information for the phase one and two and the the article is titled safety and efficacy of and this is the name of the vaccine bnt 16 162 b2 mrna covet vaccine or better known as the physical mrna vaccine this uh product is actually a lipid nanoparticle formulated with a nucleoside modified rna that encodes um the sars kobe 2 spike protein so so basically it gives the cells the information to to produce the full length spike protein in a in a in a specified uh um three-dimensional structure that is more amenable for for antigen presentation and antibody development and the way they conducted this trial uh they actually administered uh 30 micrograms of the of the vaccine which was the highest those tested in the in the earlier in the phase one and phase two study that we i think we have discussed before and and the way they stole it was two doses 21 days apart um and this is different from like the astra seneca for instance is 28 days apart the one that have been studied uh by the university of oxford and this uh analysis was uh showing the data of um healthy volunteers or volunteers 16 years of age of age and older although they had a small group of 12 to 15 they did not show those results at this point nor did they presented to the fda um and and they excluded patients with a history of immunosuppression either because of medication or or underlying condition and also um patients who had history of copying nitin although in reality they didn't uh exclude those who didn't know had covenanted so there were some patients who actually were vaccinated uh who had been exposed previously previously to copy by vaccine but it was a small minority and then the primary endpoint which is the most important where they confirm copy 19 cases and they they call confirm copy 19 cases patient who had at least one symptom and you know the classical symptoms of fever fatigue and osmia et cetera and they had to have also a pcr a positive pcr um and they actually uh started counting the cases for the primary and bone 10.7 days after the second dose that was the the moment when they said okay we're gonna really start the the the primary endpoint evaluation although they look at other other moments in the vaccination um times but it was actually for the primary important was seven days after the circles let me advance here and and one thing that i want i want just everybody to to be clear is how vaccine efficacy is calculated because you know maybe it may be intuitive but there's actually a formula for for vaccine efficacy and it's actually um a hundred times one minus the the irr and the irr is actually a ratio is the the the ratio of of patients who develop the disease among those vaccinated divided by those who who develop the disease in this case kobe 19 divided by those vaccinated by the placebo and if you use this example let's say that we have 10 000 patients and 10 develop the disease in the in the in the real vaccine in the active arm of the trial and a hundred of ten thousand develop the disease in the placebo that gives you a zero point one and then one minus point one it's it's point nine times a hundred is ninety percent so this will give you the the the so-called vaccine efficacy it's a very relatively simple formula i have seen it calculated with just by person vaccinated person but in this trial they actually use person a year so they have to calculate the follow-up and incorporate a time of follow-up of these patients in the in the formula and and they define it as um you know this formula where the irr is calculated to confirm cases of copy illness per 100 person years okay so how they did this trial had more than 40 000 participants and you can see the disposition of the patients 44 000 were screened they ended up randomizing and 43 eight um and and um some of them were assigned to the to the b uh to the to the bnt to the active vaccine um and and others to the placebo obviously this is a one to one randomization so it was equal uh probability of getting the placebo or the active um of the active vaccine and then at the end uh they ended up analyzing 1800 who who actually received the those one um i'm sorry eighteen thousand and eighteen thousand receive also the placebo and a similar number received the second dose uh of the vaccine and the placebo and you can see um very few patients if you if you take into consideration this huge trial of 18 000 only 48 and 95 discontinued after the trial after after those those two there was one patient died um unrelated death in the in this um in this arm against two and the placebo and obviously were things that you might expect if you enroll enough people that that some things might may happen to them uh during the follow-up um the distribution or the balance among the groups was was very similar because this was a randomized trial but some things to um to point out the uh white white race was actually the majority as you can see over 80 80 to 83 in each in each arm were white um very very small uh representation by other races only nine percent african-american ethnicity they had close to 30 percent latinos so so it was 27.9 and 28 in the in the bnt and placebo arms and that's that's important this is a different i think with moderna with some of the others that have higher uh higher representation by other by other races and ethnicity this was as you can see mostly mostly whites you can see the countries the age uh there was 42 percent of the of the patient were actually over 55 so that's important to have a good representation because this is this is the group more susceptible to the to the worst complication of kobe 19 and there were a significant proportion of these uh subjects um and this is probably the representation of the of the population in the u.s and in other countries 35 percent of the of the subjects were uh considered obese uh with a with a bmi over 30. and then let's let's we're going to see the safety and the efficacy the safety uh they actually collected data on the reactorgenicity which is basically and then they deal with with like an electronic with an app in which people after they got the vaccine they registered their symptoms and there were local reactions and systemic reaction and and and the authors of this paper actually divided the analysis uh between the groups and between the doses so it was um less than 55 over 55 and and and that's what we're going to see in the next few graphs so the first the first graph uh are the the younger groups 16 to 55 and you can see this is those one on top those two and these are local reactions so we're we're basically talking about redness swelling and pain and you can see really the the significant uh the only really significant uh event was was pain on the side of injection which was different from the placebo significantly different from the placebo so just to to have a sort of a ballpark idea around 80 percent uh of the subjects um developing in the injection site but but the great majority were either mild or moderate pain the red line are the the more severe pain so so that's something that we are going to expect in probably the the the biggest proportion of of of of participants or in this case of people who are vaccinated um if we see this is the same graph for but for for over 55 and the first uh detail that that that comes to mind is the fact that older folks have less reactorgenicity so you can see that here it's it's really averaging between the first and the second those around 66 and 70. so around 70 of the uh great older than 55 have had pain in the in the in the area of injection so those were the local the local uh reactions the systemic reactions are a little bit less frequent but nevertheless significant you can see the fever um and this is the age over 55 fever was 11 in this group fatigue headache more or less 20 25 but it was also present in the placebo and the placebo here was actually sailing it was not another vaccine so so you know it's reasonable to expect some degree of fatigue in in probably one third to half of the of the subject and you can see the the the second thing is that there is a difference between those one and those two in the systemic event so it's more much more frequent the the fatigue and the headache during the second dose than in the first dose but nevertheless nothing really really uh extraordinary here and you can see you know few patients have muscle pain diarrhea chills joint pain etc and this is greater than 55 and younger than than 55 you can see a very similar picture again those two is more more reactogenic than those one because probably the immune system already reacts more vigorously and you can see that some of the patients had um severe fatigue and some of the patients have severe headache um but usually the authors make the comment that the great majority of these symptoms go away after 24 maximum 48 hours so that's that's reassuring and then there were very few uh serious adverse event actually for uh and this you know taken into consideration the size of this trial for related serious subversiven um among the vaccine recipient and you can see that they're you know not really um anything anything to be concerned at this point shoulder injury related to the vaccine lymphadenopathy one patient had a ventricular arrhythmia and leg paresthesia we may have not may not nothing to do with the vaccine and and um and that there were two uh in the vaccine recipients one from atherosclerosis and another one cardiac arrest and remember we are enrolling in this patient subjects who are are older than than 55 and then really older groups so and they were also for that in the recipients also completely unrelated to the to the placebo obviously hemorrhagic stroke a myocardial infarction um but no no no none of the death were related to the vaccine or the placebo were just um you know random events that occurred to the to this large number of participants then the other the other data here is the efficacy and and they actually that the main endpoint that they look was a patient without any evidence of infection before those seven days of the second dose and the vaccine efficacy um it's 95 as you have heard in the in the in the press in the news if you look if you include those who who had kobe during the the in the in the time between the first and the second dose it didn't change significantly 94.6 um efficacy so so that's that's like the main main finding regarding uh efficacy um if we um analyze the efficacy by different groups you can see and in this column the vaccine efficacy it's really pretty uh similar across all um age groups 95 93.4 so very very very consistent among all of the groups the only common that i would make is because some of these groups have so few events the the ins the confidence intervals are really wide like in this case more than 75 there was only five cases in the in the placebo group so so as you might expect when you apply the calculation the confidence interval really are really wide i mean from -13 so non-protected to 100 protected uh in the case of the greater than 75 and the same thing happened because there were so few uh african-americans you can see yeah the efficacy was 100 but it was because there were zero and seven cases in the in the vaccine and placebo respectively so so you have to interpret that with caution but overall very consistent uh over 90 percent efficacy in in all groups studied even with underlying condition and then how soon the vaccine protects uh this is the curve of the events every square here it's a it's a kobe 19 event every circle is a it's a kobe 19 event uh in red the black vaccine group and glue the placebo and you can see that the curb tends to divert after more or less day 12 day 10 to day 12 and they make it bigger here so you can see that around day 12 you start seeing the benefit of the first dose um because the as as i mentioned this vaccine was applied um you know day 0 and day 21 so even even the first those seem to be to provide or confirm some protection and you can see how the curve divert to the point um of that and then the dark the dark marks are the severe disease and you can see there are more severe disease and the placebo only one here in the in the in the vaccine arm so so obviously this this vaccine protects against disease in general and also decreases the incidence of severe disease in those vaccinated so and this is this is probably the most important uh graph and so so for the discussion and this is my last my last slide essentially or before last um there are some unanswered questions i mean we know that the ficus is 90 95 but there's still questions about it does does this vaccine prevent transmission that wasn't really analyzed in this paper or in the report to the fda for that they need to look at asymptomatic infection and we don't know if it prevents asymptomatic infection they do comment in the paper that they they are going to have a serologic endpoint which is going to tell us if the vaccine worked against asymptomatic infection or not but we don't have that information obviously this this was the median follow-up of two months uh for severity and efficacy so we really don't know um you know how long the protection is going to last and and obviously despite being very large trial i mean if there is an event that is less than uh it's less frequent than point zero one percent it's probably not um this study was not detected or it was not i'm sorry designed to detect uh such an infrequent event so we have to wait when they vaccinate you know hundreds of thousands of people to actually see those very rare events events if there's going to be any uh and finally there are some subgroups which which were really not um reported there were 196 hiv hiv-positive patients in the study but they didn't report the immunogenicity in that group they excluded immunosuppressed they excluded pregnant and bacterium females although the the american society of obstetric and american college of society society of or college of uh obstetrics and gynecology actually um um said that that if if uh if a working person in a kobe war like a nurse that works in icu is pregnant and requires the vaccine that the vaccine can be given because they they think there's not um data that there's any any um ill effect with it but it obviously wasn't it wasn't stolen in this group and then again the less than 16 still need future uh or newer studies and then the other thing that has been speculated it's uh it because the graph separated at 12 days um could we use just one dose and vaccinate more people and that's something that this story was not designed because obviously at day 21 people got another dose so you don't know how long that that single dose protection really lasts so so it's it's impossible to tell but those are some of the questions that i that i have uh after reading the the the pfizer report for the to the fda and these and this paper and and just and and i have heard this quote several times but i just want to um remind this quote by whistling treasury which i think it's it's uh um it's uh important at this point where we are um and this this happened when when when the the the british got the first victory against germany in egypt um and he said now this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning so so that's what we are i think right now thank you i want to start stop sharing and and go to to carl and joanna thank you thank you dr sosa so much that was a fantastic review of the the pfizer uh vaccine really appreciate it um for everyone on the call right now please please continue to put in put your questions in the chat um so you don't forget them and so we have we can get to them as soon as our updates are over with we're gonna turn to uh dr leslie hayes our ambulatory specialist dr hayes and then we're going to proceed on to uh marla sivers has some updates from the department of health regarding vaccines hi so i'm actually not going to be um talking about studies this week i um got curious there are definitely things that i've learned from cobit that i think i will learn in the use in the future and i asked my covid group on facebook and the providers i work with what they have learned from kova that they will use in a post-covert world and um i got so many really fascinating responses i'm not going to get through all of this today i'm just going to go through um the first few slides especially because i want to hear what um marla has to say but i thought i'd just start and um one of my favorite comments was the experience of the pandemic reminds me of those blue kid pills the kids the dentists used to get kids to chew to show them all the places they missed with their toothbrush and covet has definitely shown us where the gaps were and i know that's a pink pill the blue ones looked really pretty awful and i decided i couldn't put that up so by far and away the three most popular responses that i got on what people thought that they would continue to do differently after the pandemic is over because of their experience with covid were telehealth masks and zoom and if anyone is not following andrew cotter and his dogs on twitter you definitely want to do it this is his zoom meeting with his dogs to discuss um the the business so today i'm just going to go over what people said they had learned about telehealth during the pandemic and so people said there were a lot of advantages for providers from telehealth telehealth has opened up a world of possibilities i can leave for a month continue to see patients not have to ask anyone to cover for me telehealth visits are especially helpful for our patients with transportation issues time management is so much easier if you can do telemedicine for things like medication checks and follow-up visits for a lot of issues and i think this is a really important one we have a mechanism in my department to switch your schedule to remote if you're sick but not that sick so then we don't infect each other working from home does not equal low productivity i think we've all been kind of shocked to find that we are actually as productive or more so when we work from home we can also do things like get the laundry done and sweep and mop the floors in between patients for people who have long commutes it definitely saves on commute commuting time someone posted that they live in a chicago suburb and they were saving an hour and a half every day saves on gas eating out and buying new outfits and very cost effective cherry on top is the kids are ill you don't have to get emergency child care and somebody who couldn't work from home commented that hopefully everyone else has learned that it's feasible to work from home so the traffic is better for the people who actually can't work from home and then some visits just are better over telehealth according um uh so newborn televisions um it's so much nicer to have people i'm getting an echo somewhere um it's so much nicer not to have to make people schlep a newborn baby out things like reflux dacross that cryostenosis constipation if the baby is cooing and term and looks well it's just as easy to see them over the phone laceration evaluation is another thing that people said works well over the phone and then definitely for i have found for patients with substance use disorder and mental health issues that they're often willing to tell me stuff over the phone that they're just too embarrassed to say in person and then um social anxiety severe depression generalized anxiety ptsd all of them can be much more open over the phone than they ever were in person um people mentioned for rare conditions if there's only you know one specialist who deals with your condition in denver sometimes it's really helpful to be able to get an expert opinion um over the telehealth and someone else mentioned they're in oncology and they're two hours from new york city or philadelphia and but a lot of the patients hate to leave home and they can actually get sub-specialty opinions uh without convincing the patients to travel and then advantages for patients it's a great time saver one physician mentioned that they didn't have to take time off or drive two hours round trip for a fall appointment they just closed their office door for 15 minutes and then they were back at work and then also for patients who have a baby and don't have child care it's been a real blessing for them sometimes they're distracted but someone calling and connecting with them is better than nothing somebody did mention one disadvantage and i've definitely had this where some patients are not making their appointments a priority you're calling them and they are shopping i had one patient who was driving and doing a video call i made him pull over um i've definitely had patients who were you know comparing the prices of uh various cuts of meat while i'm trying to talk to them um having people over they're not making their appointments a priority as much as they would if they came in then the other thing is payment um i think we've all realized we were providing just a huge amount of free medical care over the phone before now and that actually can be put into a telemedicine build um everybody's hoping insurance will really continue to cover and patients really appreciate it it makes follow-ups much easier especially for patients with transportation issues and also hopefully insurance companies will continue to allow us to build just for phone sessions we've gone mostly to phone in my organization because so few people have smart phones or video connections and much of northern new mexico just does not have the bandwidth to do zoom for patients with economic and other barriers there was a lot of disagreement among the comments about whether or not it was more beneficial or less i personally found it to be very beneficial one person her comment was telehealth for what she called sdoh social determinants of health patients is ensuring that they will continue to do worse i'm not totally sure that's true but definitely there are patients who it's made worse um somebody said the majority of their patients just don't have the technology to do telehealth and they have ended up in the er more than usual out of medication and doing worse than before and technology is a barrier but transportation is also a barrier so it's hard to say which is harder for people and somebody commented that it seemed worse for the rural and elderly patients but better for the more urban disadvantaged patients who have a decent video signal somebody else said that their english as a second language patients um just were not able to do the telephone visits and they've been transferring into this clinic who would see them in person and somebody else commented that televisions are a great way to reach many of the underserved and marginalized patients and the home bell and elderly are happy to have the telephone visits and they have been following up more and then somebody else said they'd had the opposite experience from patients who were struggling with telehealth and instead they'd done several research qi projects and they found that the number one barrier for their patients was transportation so the expansion of telehealth had really let them reach patients who otherwise had had very inconsistent care and now and i've certainly had this happen as well that patients who really need an in-office visit for a pelvic exam or something else like that just want to do all of it over the phone it's like no i really can't do this visit over the phone and um somebody else commented that they're less privileged patients had a hard time getting the office for appointments whether they were working or they had to go pick up their child so they were much better able to follow up with video visits and i think yeah so and i'll go on to the next section next week thank you dr hayes um fantastic um and it'd be curious to see what other people um are doing in terms of their uh televisions and uh zoom visits as well well that was a nice break from turning now to marla sivers to talk about vaccines again um marla are you there i'm here great um what can you tell us in terms of you know vaccine distribution in new mexico and um uh any any gaps that dr sosa did not provide what would you be able to share with us and we also had some questions in the chat that i can either go over after or you can certainly maybe get to right now sure i wanted to share some updates from some phone calls that i attended over the weekend with cdc and members from the fda and asip advisory committees where they discussed some of the recommendations that they have now posted on the cdc and fda website so just sort of to share an update from those calls and share what's happening in new mexico so as you all know the fdi fda immunization advisory committee met on december 10th and recommended that the fda grant emergency use authorization for the pfizer vaccine in person 16 years of age and older and the fda issued that emergency youth authorization on friday evening and shipments of the vaccine began over the weekend some vaccine has already arrived in new mexico today and some healthcare workers in one of our hub hospitals will start receiving their vaccine this afternoon so we are expecting additional shipments of that initial 17 500 pfizer doses to arrive to continue to arrive today but also to arrive tomorrow and wednesday and vaccine distribution will begin immediately hhs will be rolling out additional supplies of vaccine as they become available and part of how states will get their allocation is based on not only their population but their demonstrated ability to mobilize the vaccine and get it administered so all vaccines that are administered are reported through our statewide immunization monitoring program through the impsis nmcis and that gets reported daily to hhs and so as we are able to demonstrate our ability to get the vaccine distributed and show that it's not sitting in a refrigerator or a freezer somewhere we can expect that we'll continue to receive additional distributions week by week so the pfizer uh vaccine is two doses administered 21 days apart um there was some discussion um over the weekend you know what would happen if a person was not able to get their second dose on the 21st day um and there was some discussion about sort of a three-day window on either side of that um to get your second dose um it looks like what's on the cdc website is you know up to three days before day 21 and if you go past day 21 then getting your second dose as soon as possible um after day 21. so the vaccine is shipped in multi-dose vials that are not diluted and frozen as you all know and the vaccine has to be thought at room temperature um for at least 30 minutes so brought up to room temperature diluted and then administered once the vaccine's been diluted and reconstituted it's only good for six hours and after six hours any remaining vaccine must be discarded so there's an fda fact sheet that's up on the fda webpage this morning that walks through all of the dosage handling and administration instructions just a warning it's quite long it's 29 pages but it is available on the fda website today the pfizer vaccine should not be administered to individuals with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine and the discussion this weekend the two adverse reactions in the uk are still being investigated but the current thinking is that these two healthcare providers who had severe allergic reactions were reacting to one of the lipid nano particles in the vaccine um so that's the current thinking and the full dosing and contraindications for people who have previous known allergies as in the package insert they did recommend that people who had had serious reactions to other vaccines or injectables sort of proceed with caution basically you know have a risk assessment discussion with your health care provider make sure that the vaccine would be administered in a setting where a severe allergic reaction could be appropriately managed and that that person should be observed for 30 minutes following their vaccination so those people can still be vaccinated but it's a you know discuss and proceed with caution make sure you're getting the vaccine in the appropriate setting um the most common side effects is dr said we're really injection site pain and redness chills fatigue muscle aches joint pain typically these reactions developed within one to three days following the vaccination and similarly resolved with within one to three days so fairly mild reactions um let's see there's really no data currently on the safety and efficacy of using the vaccine and pregnant and lactating persons however the american college of obstetrics and gynecology did come out with a statement saying if you're a person who would normally be prioritized for vaccine because of your work or your exposures and you happen to be pregnant you should discuss with your provider but that they would recommend proceeding with vaccine unless there was another reason not to like one of these you know severe allergic reactions the vaccine should not be co-administered with other vaccines so you can't get your flu vaccine and your covet vaccine at the same time they recommend that you wait at least 14 days before or after before administering any other vaccines people who were previously infected with covet 19 can be vaccinated as long as they're outside their infectious periods so if they've met the criteria for recovery and they're no longer in their infectious period they can receive the vaccine however there was some discussion that people may want to sort of de-prioritize in that first 90 days following their infection they will have some natural immunity and while vaccine supplies are very limited those people may choose to sort of de-prioritize themselves during that 90 days post-infection people who have received who had coveted and received a monoclonal antibody treatment the current recommendation uh discussed over the weekend was that those people should wait 90 days before receiving the vaccine so those are people who've received treatment with monoclonal antibodies um there were some questions about how getting the vaccine might affect future covid tests so there's no reason to think that getting a copic vaccine would affect your test result from a pcr or an antigen test um there are some igg and igms that look for that spike protein and so those current serology tests would not be able to determine between uh you know vaccine response or a response from covet infection so how that will impact you know ongoing serial prevalence studies is sort of unknown at this point so i think more information to come about that people who get their first dose with the spicer vaccine should also get their second dose with the same vaccine product there's currently no evidence about mixing vaccine products when people get vaccinated they'll get a card which gives information about the type of the vaccine they received the date they received it when their second dose is due and also importantly a link to a phone app called v-safe that will be used to conduct um active uh post-vaccine monitoring so people who enroll in be safe will get a text message every day for the first five days um inquiring about any vaccine reactions and linking people to resources if they report vaccine reactions and then after the initial five days they'll get a weekly message for the next five weeks they'll also get a reminder by text when it's almost time for them to get their second dose and then there's some ongoing monitoring at 3 6 and 12 months post vaccination through this v-safe phone app there's a copa19 vaccination tool kit which has been posted to cdc um and on december 17th so thursday this week the fda advisory committee will be meeting again to discuss emergency use authorization recommendations for the moderna vaccine and so if the panel recommends an emergency use authorization i suspect that fda will move quickly on that like they did with the pfizer vaccine if the moderna vaccine is approved we're expecting about 40 000 doses to come to new mexico um in that following a couple of weeks many of those are going to be distributed through a federal pharmacy partnership program with cvs and walgreens which will target long-term care residents and staff and i'll in the chat i'm going to put a email address that clinicians can use to reach out to the vaccine program if they have questions about when their you know clinic or healthcare setting may be prioritized for vaccine and how to get connected with those resources so i'll put that in the chat so people have it thank you marla that was an amazing update and we are so appreciative uh for your time and all the meetings there was so much more so i tried to give like a really quick kind of the top questions that uh came up and um even though dr sosa reminded us this is not the end i have to tell you i feel almost giddy with excitement that this is finally happening yeah well if you're if you're giddy i'm gonna i'm gonna really get giddy then i'm gonna follow your lead if you're giddy that's good news marla um i'm gonna turn it over to carla who's uh who has lots of questions um i know there's most of the questions are vaccine related and since we have you uh we'd like to you know be able to ask you and nestor lots of vaccine related questions today so carla thank you thank you joanna um you amazingly you answered a lot of them violet in your in your discussion but there is a and i'm not sure if you talked about this specifically but fred fox was asking where in new mexico is the pfizer vaccine being distributed so that initial allotment from pfizer it's a very small number of doses 17 500 doses and it's being primarily distributed to our partner hub hospitals so these are the hub hospitals that have been working you know since the beginning of the pandemic as part of our triage and transfer team um you know they're the primary sort of health systems located in each of their health regions throughout the state and so they will be receiving sort of those first doses to vaccinate their priority health care staff such as nurses who work you know in the icu uh critical care providers respiratory therapists intensivists each hospital has kind of created their priority list there's obviously not a vaccine to be enough vaccine available initially to be able to vaccinate everyone on that list um so hospitals will have sort of their own pri prioritization protocol and as we get more vaccine you know those will start to become open pods rather than closed pods and i know many hospitals are planning on working with partner institutions first responders ems and others in that priority group in their region to help distribute vaccine to those folks as well thank you marla and there's another question about the navajo nation was that is that allotment include the navajo nation or did i think they got separate vaccine is what i read they got a separate vaccine allotment and also uh federal facilities like the va and ihs are getting a separate allotment as well okay perfect thank you and there's a question about bell's palsy is i don't know nestor if you want to comment on this was there um bell's palsy scene related to the vaccine yeah there was a not on the pfizer vaccine but i saw the report for the astra seneca vaccine there were three cases of facial paralysis on each arm actually three in the placebo and three cases in the in the treatment arm so so and you know the if you have 40 000 patients you may see some facial paralysis the the incidence is around 20 to 30 cases for 100 000 people so if you have 40 people and you follow them long enough some of them will develop facial paralysis and and it could be unrelated to the vaccine but but yeah there were three cases in the vaccine in the astrazeneca stories uh but there was also three cases in the in the placebo i don't remember if there were any in the physics i don't think there was any in the pfizer because i i look at the data and i didn't see facial paralysis but i may be wrong but i remember clearly but it's it's something that is expected with this huge number of people who are enrolled thank you very much um there's a question from may goldenberg about is vaccine contraindicated for those on tnf blockers or other immunosuppressive medications i don't know marla or either if either of you know that uh currently no um the only contraindication that fda is currently um stating is people who've had a known allergic reaction to a vaccine com to a vaccine component that's part of the pfizer vaccine so that may change um as we learn more over the next few weeks but currently it's not a contraindication they do however say you know there's not enough information to know um about the efficacy of the vaccine in that group and what their immune response will be right thank you and another question about dial should dialysis patients be prioritized or do you know where they are in the prioritization scheme i think people with uh significant underlying conditions are in phase 1b so still in that first tier after we sort of get through um the healthcare worker priority thank you jeff miller do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question i'm not sure if you feel like it was answered or can you go ahead and unmute yourself okay sure oh i can you hear me [Music] oh sorry i was asking for jeffrey miller to unmute himself i apologize no problem can you hear me yeah so uh my question is uh with the fate when you're talking about getting to patients there are different priorities of patients how is the system going to determine when someone can go get their shot so for example would doctors have to write an order that hey my patient has this pre-existing condition or how are we how is that going to be figured out so i think some of that is still being figured out um however you know once we get into um a period where we're sort of past the phase you know one a group moving into the phase one b group if we have more vaccine available from moderna that doesn't require the ultracold storage you know then i think the plan for the vaccine program is to engage their vaccine partners people who are already doing vaccines you know in clinics throughout the community who are enrolled with the new mexico vaccine program to start to actually have those clinicians be able to place orders for the vaccine and vaccinate in their clinic that's a little further down the line you know not until after the first of the year until we have more supply i think will those um you know that roll out get firmed up a little bit more so i don't have a great answer to that question except that you know that's sort of in the planning phase as we uh move to the period of time where we have more vaccine available thank you marla there's been a couple of questions i know you said that you were going to put um some information into the chat but about how physicians in the community who are not connected to these hub hospitals how they are going to access vaccine for their patients yeah and that's you know again going to be a distribution through the vaccine program i put the email address in the chat so people can email the vaccine program to inquire you know specifically about when their clinic would be able to order okay thank you very much um joanna back over to you thanks carla um and thanks nestor and and marla as well um there's a question from daniel smith daniel do you want to unmute and ask your question uh sure hi uh this is dan smith uh here i'm a director of pharmacy at the new mexico behavior at health institute and um uh i'm just getting lots of questions from people worried about egg allergies and we know lots of vaccines sometimes are derived from porsche elements or bovine elements and my read is that that doesn't seem to be an issue with the at least the pfizer vaccine i think modern as well and just looking for some confirmation of that point and then i think daniel you also asked about um is history of guillain-barre a contraindication thanks daniel thank you nestor or marla do you want to take that one yeah i just say what i know about the manufacturer this vaccine because it's not derived from a virus it's actually a synthetic product of mrna and then lipid um components which which accompanied the mrna there's no um link which either egg or or any other animal product that we know of it and that's what there's no advice on allergy to eggs or or any animal product because it's completely synthetic it's done essentially in the lab uh and not derived from from like cell cultures in in embryonated eggs or something like that that we used to do with with the influenza vaccine uh thank you nestor um and i think we talked about uh melvina mccabe asked about the distribution to ihs hospitals and i think marley you said that that was a a separate distribution line as as was the the va hospital um i think as well as the pueblos as well too marla ihs will have their own um allocation so not all uh tribal entities you know are part of ihs so the ones that aren't will coordinate with department of health but ihs facilities will get their own allotment great um i'm wondering if uh laura perrajone if you might want to unmute and ask your question about those people experiencing homelessness oh hi thank you joanna that's so nice of you to allow me to ask my question yeah so um i have a question about seven day quarantine i know that the you know that new mexico doesn't have the seven day quarantine but we do have a lot of people experiencing homelessness at the largest shelter here it's about 300 people a night there and many of them don't you know it's difficult for them to stay the 14-day quarantine and so we were wondering dr sosa if you have any thoughts about that for certain types of populations like people experiencing homelessness would you consider a seven day knowing that they perhaps might stay seven days so you could assure at least seven days of quarantine and then would you consider then doing like um we have an id now um abbott id binax testing unit there and i was wondering what your thoughts were on that it's still a pcr i know and i've heard it's not as accurate but would that be a reasonable thing um to do um yeah i know it's kind of like off label right now but what are your thoughts on that yeah no that's a great question i really have uh i haven't really thought much of of of of that and and the logistics of vaccinating homeless persons and um you know the use of of the uh um binax uh id now so i i don't really have i don't know if marla or some of the other uh in the in the in the group can can answer but i really haven't really thought of that to be honest laura marla any thoughts about the seven a seven day quarantine yeah hi dr paran um i i've seen your written proposal about this um and i think yeah yeah david shared it with me and um you know i think that for your setting and the resources that you have available including the binax testing you know i think your your reasoning and your plan is sound and makes a lot of sense um and i know you're sort of waiting for some more official feedback from department of health about that but um i did see your proposal and you know i think you're kind of utilizing all of your resources and making the best of a really difficult situation to try to make sure people is or you know are as protected as possible yeah and i guess my question was also around like using like because we have both the binax now the little you know the one that looks like the pregnancy test but we also have the id now little machine that apparently is pcr and more accurate like if if that was a situation where you would say let's end the quarantine at seven days you know would it be would it be better preferable i mean obviously it's kind of difficult sometimes because we have a huge number of people in there but like would it be would it be okay to say if you're trying to compare the id now test machine you know the machine versus the binax cards do you guys have a preference around that i guess that's kind of another question i have like yeah in general i can tell you it's we don't have carrissa here to help us but in general the the obviously the rapid test the lateral flow test have a slightly lower sensitivity than the than the more formal you know machine base electronic reader pcr so so if if i i guess if if you're planning to shorten the quarantine you like a sensitive test you don't want people with infection be released from quarantine but it's it's a cost uh effectivity analysis and it depends on you know the resources but obviously if i have a choice and and and cost is not an issue i will select the most sensitive test uh in order to to prevent people from from escaping detection uh because in fact yeah id now and some of the antigen tests require a higher viral load they're a good indication of of transmissibility where their sensitivity is slightly lower than than the than the standard pcrs or the more sophisticated pcr determination correct okay thank you so much this is super helpful so so you would say just overall um i mean obviously i'm waiting for the doh i just wanted like it was that asked dr sosa days like yay um to just ask for like the scientific back background piece of it um okay so so yeah so um so uh marla i will just await whatever you guys decide and then i just wanted to know like scientifically was it okay thanks laura thank you thank you great appreciate it um i just wanted to turn to uh dr fred fox would you like to unmute and ask your question you have got a great question or maybe i will just an interest of time be able to read it whatever um would you like to ask it or you're you're muted sure my question had to do about the availability of the vaccine to rural and small town healthcare providers since the pfizer's going to the big places and the first modernist going to cvs for long-term care facilities that leaves small town and rural healthcare workers out in the cold initially for phase 1a are they looking at that for any other way to get vaccine to those groups of healthcare work so is spicer going to also be distributing to to the smaller hospitals in other words yeah so the hub hospitals will be doing uh some redistribution to their spoke hospitals um so you know if you look at your designated hub hub hospital um you know in your area so you know like for roswell um eastern new mexico medical center is the is the hub hospital but they're working with their spoke hospitals so those smaller community hospitals around them to help identify those people in phase 1a and distribute vaccine through that hub and spoke model that has existed as i said kind of from the beginning of the pandemic to help make sure we're allocating you know hospital beds and other hospital resources effectively thank you marla i just wanted to point everybody to the um at 12 45 the cme link went into the chat and even if you don't need it you can certainly fill it out and always give us pointers in in terms of how we can do better um just in the interest of time i'd like to invite dr laura tomadi she's one of our project echo senior research scientists to come on and just tell you a little bit about a project that um that she's doing um in terms of looking in terms of improving uh the quality of this office hours infectious disease echo dr tomati hi thank you all so i know that we're um almost that time but i wanted to thank you all so much for participating in this echo and hopefully it's been helpful to you um we especially as the landscape of covet is about to change pretty drastically we'd really like to hear from you on how we can improve this echo what has worked for you um so we're going to be conducting just a a small focus group sometime between the 18th and the 22nd um right after the session today you will receive an email from that new mexico govind19 email address that you get the you get the registration info for this session you'll be getting an email from the email address that will invite you to um participate in a focus group where you would give us feedback so that we can make this the best possible echo for everybody involved um please please share your feedback we would really appreciate it um just so you know that email will go out to folks who have attended three or excuse me four or more times so if you've only if you're new to the echo you've only attended maybe once or twice uh you are super welcome we hope that you will definitely continue to join us however we're hoping this time to just do the focus groups among the folks who have attended for more time so please email us um at that email and let us know if you are willing to um you know give us your feedback we would love it and we'd really appreciate it would uh hopefully just take a little bit of your time um so thank you i hope you all have a good day thank you so much laura we really appreciate it and we we certainly appreciate everybody on on the line right now and every week um with that i just wanted to let everybody know that we have many weekly uh echoes at two o'clock today we have a first responder resiliency echo that is talking about coping with grief um we have an uh dr michelle harkins has a critical care echo this thursday and i'm just uh it slipped my mind the topic but i think elena martinez might be able to post it in the chat um and then um i believe um over the course of the next couple of weeks dr aurora is is having echo covered 19 um conversations kind of global conversations about a covid19 that you might be getting emails about as well so really wanted to thank dr hayes dr sosa and thank marla for coming on today and give a special update on vaccines and um hope we all we will see you all next week and i really hope you might be able to participate in the focus group sessions we'll learn an awful lot thank you everybody thank you carla you,,12/14/2020
31,okay okay that was a little louder okay welcome everybody to office hours it's december 21st and i'm joanna katzman i think i'm i think carla thornton is not here today um and uh i just wanted to let everybody know it's really good to see you i we had a great session last week talking about the new pfizer vaccine and really appreciate dr sosa dr hayes and dr sivers being on and giving such great updates just wanted to let everybody know that if you have a camera and it's on fantastic if you don't and you can put it on please do so it really is in line with the echo model and we can see you and it aligns with better uh better teaching also our fantastic digital librarian kent knowsworthy is on and he's always ready uh and always uh putting evidence guided and evidence-based information from our speakers and our subject matter experts into the chat which you can copy and paste and put into your browser and and take with you right away and finally um please don't hesitate to put any questions i see some already coming in to put any questions that you have into the chat because we have eliminated the pre-registration pre-registration questions and i really want to get your questions covered as soon as possible so with that i'd like to turn it over to dr sosa dr nester sosa nester is our chief of infectious disease at university of new mexico school of medicine and we're so happy to have us having him lead us so thank you nestor thank you joanna thank you very much let me get my slides on the screen one second okay i have prepared actually two sets of slides one with the latest article and if if there are a lot of questions on the modern vaccine i also have a few slides with information from the modern vaccine but i'll leave it for the for the end after the discussion um out of respect for the other for the other um experts here on in the panel i i already saw a question on the new uh strain or new variant uh from the uk so i decided to start with with that uh and there are a few um communications already scientific communications about this on top of everything that has been um discussed in the in the late press so this is this is one of those uh you know high uh headlines that the really scary headlines that i that i saw over the weekend the secretary of health of of england saying that that kobe 19 is out of control and there's this new this new strain so what do we know about about it before i go into that i'm just going to give a brief overlook or overview on how these mutations are identified because you're going to see people throwing letters at you with you know the n501 mutation which is very important blah blah blah so i want to just a quick review this is sort of a biochemistry thing so you know the proteins are made of of amino acids so there are a lot of amino acids that can make a protein and they are identified either by the three letter code like alanine is allah but they also have a letter um so in order to sort of uh uh to get an abbreviated um uh change in the in the proteins the the the way the the the scientists refer to these changes in protein is they mentioned the new amino acid i'm sorry the original amino acid in the protein in which position the change has occurred and the name of the new amino acid so in this case um there was uh asparagine here and was substituting in position 501 by y which is basically theoretic tyrosine or tyrosine so that's that's essentially what these numbers and you're going to see these numbers and they're others like when there's deletions or insertions they are slightly different but that's that give you a general idea so what is this new this new stream first of all it was detected in september so it's not completely new started uh you know the scientists in the uk and many other countries they actually doing uh genome sequencing of of the virus circulating to see what type of mutations that we know the rna virus do mutate so they have changes here and there uh but then all of a sudden like it happened a few months ago with the d6614 mutation this new uh this new strain seems to be uh seems to be becoming more frequent in the uk and it's already reported in other in other places in in europe so they they actually no notice that this new variant which are calling either bui 202012 0 1 or b117 it's so complicated also people refer to it as n501y because this is like a dominant mutation in the in the receptor binding domain um actually this new variant has between 17 and 23 mutations so it's really a pretty a pretty uh mutated uh spike protein from the virus and some of the mutations are important the 501 the one that sometimes gives the name it's in the receptor binding domain so this is the area where where actually the the protein attaches to the ace two receptors so any changes there obviously need to be uh studied carefully there's also uh another important site in the other side of the protein the sort of the furing cleavage side and there's a mutation there so that that may have some some translation into changes in the behavior of the virus it may have occur and this is a speculation um because the virus is circulating human population we're using convalescent plasma so it may be a disaccumulation a mutation may be actually a mechanism of the of the virus escaping the immune attack of of you know from from from serum plasma or antibody use um they have already been more than 3000 isolation of these uh of these wires with these mutations and it's actually according to a source very frequent 62 of the recent strains from london have this mutation um and there's also this is also speculation they feel because it's becoming so prevalent that it's also um transmits more rapidly or or more readily but to be honest i think we still we know that the mutation is there we know that it's it's becoming abundant or frequent but i think all of the other concerns are still theoretical we need to confirm uh that in fact is transmitted with experiments in ferrets or or other animals to see if their emission is or in cells to see that it transmit more readily uh we have to see the clinical course to see if it's more severe or less severe there's no reports of that it's too early yet yet we need to also see and there's another concern do the vaccines also cover this this strain where we have to take serum from people who have been vaccinated and see if that serum neutralizes the virus this this strain we haven't seen that they're probably running to do these experiments in the uk as we speak but we we haven't seen any any publication or pre-publication though the monoclonal antibodies like bangla limit works against this we don't know we have to do the experiments and the experience have to be reviewed on public so i think there's many many questions i wouldn't really um you know be too too concerned although the warhead organization and some governments are already restricting travel from the uk the uk went into a lockdown because you know it's the careful and the right thing to do uh until you get all these questions answered because if all the questions the answer is a wrong answer if the vaccine doesn't work the monoclonals do not work then you need to find alternatives so in the meantime the good thing is to try to to prevent the transmission so that's all i'm i'm going to say but it's so and if you see in the illustration i i skipped that but the it has a deletion so it had lost par these two amino acids position 69 and 70 which is actually in an important area of the virus and this is the receptor binding domain has several highlighted in red several mutations in this area which is the area where the virus attaches to the to the a2 so you can you can you know you can speculate that yeah those changes maybe maybe alter the behavior of the virus as a whole and make makes it could make it more efficient to infect cells we just don't know we have to to wait for that okay let's move on uh and these are all the changes it has many many mutations this is a list of the mutation i already mentioned the n501 the one um that that it's in the in the active site and there but there are many others so that's that's important and people are looking for these mutations in their in the virus that they're isolating um there's another interesting paper out of korea i'm always impressed by these studies done in japan korea and in china about contact tracing because they do have like a very sophisticated way to do contact racing um and the story goes the the the the investigators in korea found three uh young adults um uh with with uh with sarcoby2 with infection and they couldn't you know find who infected them so they actually use uh an app that actually um uh evaluates where you you have been in the days before your infection so they can actually track you know uh geographical where where have you been and they actually during this this um investigation they found that these three persons not related not family they didn't know each other had been in a restaurant at the same time the same day so then they went ahead and look at the at the close circuit tv of that restaurant and they actually were able to to establish where these persons were in the restaurant and they found that one person that we call the infector is case b case b infected these two other persons that were detected through this contact racing um one person interestingly enough was 6.5 meters away from the infector b um and only five minutes in the restaurant without a mass so they coincided only for five minutes in the restaurant the other were coincided in the restaurant or where together in the restaurant or at the same time for 21 minutes but he was also 4.8 so you know it was kind of unusual these long distances i mean they were unmasked so they when they look at the distribution they found this is case b this is the the blueprint of the of the restaurant yellow are the tables um the see the shares around the table you can see there are four shares around each table the infector that we're calling in factor mr b mr b was here and mr c and a the two person that became infected from this person were uh 4.8 and 6.5 meters away and what they discovered is that the air movement and they studied the air movement in the restaurant um the the stream from the ceiling air conditioning move like this as you see the arrow it bounce against the wall here and then it goes straight into these two persons so only those two persons became infected all of these other person that were in the restaurant did not become infected so this highlights one the possibility of transmission in a longer distance number two the importance of air circulation in a room obviously this person who was in front of me also got infected this was his um you know the person that went to to to eat uh with this person b he also got infected but then that b infected these two that were relatively far away so i think it's a it's an elegant experiment that combined you know the close circuit tv uh airflow uh airflow dynamics in the in the in the restaurant and obviously the contact tracing app that was able to put this person in the same place at the same time um using this uh technology okay the regarding therapeutics is a new um a new drug that has been studied for kobe uh this was part of the nih act study in fact it was the act ii and it's called varicity which is uh it's a janus kinase inhibitor and i just want to show you quickly the results of the story varicity um the janus kinase it's it's it's really an intracellular enzyme that that helps the inflammation so it's sort of pro-inflammatory so in many rheumatic disease rheumatologic diseases um you can use this inhibitor of the janus canis and decreases the inflammatory cytokine production it may also have some antiviral effect and also increase increases the lymphocytes so the investigator at the nih decided to to treat the patient with rendezvous which is sort of the standard of care for hospitalized patients with with hypoxemia and they added by sitting into one of the arms uh and actually the varicity was given every day four milligrams for 14 days with the render severe for less than 10 days or up to 10 days they actually um did this top of line randomized uh in which one arm receiver and their cv varsity but we did this study at unm we were one of the sites uh dr harkins was the uh the principal investigator so one arm had rendezvous very seating the other one rendezvous alone they unroll a thousand over a thousand patients um and what they found the main result was actually a shortening in one day of the recovery the the endpoint was time to recovery and they found seven days with the rendezvous varicity versus eight days so um one day short no no big not a big finding but at least one day recovery although when they look at patients in what they call the the level six which are patients basically on high flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation so these are patients who are sicker than the regular patients that come and are receiving oxygen by by just a nasal cannula they are in high flow or non-invasive but they're not intubated or ecmo so that that's that group in that group particularly they found a larger difference 10-days recovery versus 18 days rendezvous so it shortened it shortened the recovery by eight days the combination of rendezvous by sydney and there was also a 10 um a trend towards lower mortality the 28 day mortality was 5.1 for the combination 7.9 from the during this year but it crosses one so it was not uh statistically significant so i think a lot of places hospitals um infectious disease society of america are analyzing these results and and and thinking and considering the addition of barista i would say if anything for patients who have this more severe disease with high nasal high flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation this is the the graft that we have seen this similar graph you can see how varsity uh recovery tended to be better than placebo almost throughout the whole uh period of follow-up okay and then another this is more an epidemiological study which i found very interesting um and and answers the question in part the question what happens if we let the virus run unmitigated uh and this has happened in some places in latin america for instance peru people are are studying the the prevalence in peru and it's over 50 percent um in in some areas also in some areas of mexico is over 50 percent of the population have already been infected so this this scientist actually did a study in brazil in two cities in brazil they did in manaus which is in the amazon it's a two million uh um two million uh inhabitant city in in the in the center of the amazon and sao paulo which is one of the largest cities in the world and you can see they used uh you know some modeling and they they actually tested uh donors in blood banks and and donors you know in in in these two different cities and you can see that according to them close to 75 um of the of the people that lives in manaus brazil have already been infected by um october uh of this year so and you can see this is the curve in gray you can see the curve how high when a number of cases per day and then it went down but it probably went down because of her immunity actually because a lot of people had already been infected according to her calculation obviously much less in in sao pablo which is a different they did a different intervention here the the epidemic was basically left on mitigated there was no significant contact tracing because of lack of resources so the the epidemic really uh became very widespread here it was much more controlled and nevertheless they have close to 25 29 uh positivity so interesting uh epidemiological paper and finally i think dr herzmann i don't know if he's here but he he asked me to review this this paper which i have already seen uh and and you remember that early in the epidemic people were um speculating that maybe if you if you get something like if you if you get mmr vaccine or if you get bcg the tuberculosis vaccination it may help indirectly protect you against kobe 19. well these these authors actually did a study i'm going to show you the study they did a study in which they they took 80 people and they divided the 80 people in 50 and 30 50 were um younger folks who who presumably had received or had evidence in their medical history of uh of reception of nmr2 so the newer the the current mmr vaccine and then the other 30 were older folks who were not vaccinated or had natural infection and they actually measured the levels of antibodies in both groups and they found that those who had a high level of antibodies against mumps which is not really similar to kobe but but this was the finding so patients who had a high mumps tighter not missiles not rubella which are the two other viruses and vaccine exclusively mump there was a clear-cut correlation between high antibodies and protection so people with very high level were basically functionally functionally immune meaning that they have been exposed um very close exposure to to to sarcoby 2 and no no infection or they became infected but were symptomatic if their level was 1.1.3 and so on the lower the level of antibodies against mumps the higher the severity of the disease so it was a it's obviously an association uh it needs to be um corroborated by other studies but it's interesting that if you have antibodies against mumps which has not been reported before you seem to be protected so there you go so you know the the logical thing would be to do actually mmr vaccination and and and prospectively evaluate that intervention but i think probably now with the vaccines coming down down the down the line it's it's probably not a big big issue but it's interesting nevertheless this finding and finally i just want to i'm not going to do any any um vaccine study today but i just wanna for for those who who because i get a lot of questions um in other in other sessions that i do how do mrna vaccine work i found this illustration very simple so the mrna vaccines are actually um messenger rna encoded in a lipid in a lipid nanoparticle and this is done number one to protect the mrna from from lysis when it's entered into the into the human body when once it's injected and second because the lipid uh code helps the the mrna enters a cell it produces what we call a transfection of the cell and then the mrna gets into the cytosol into the cytoplasm of the cell and and and then it's translated into the proteins that in this case all of the mrna vaccine that we have so far encode for the spy protein and then the spy protein um is either release and and it stimulates production of antibody or it's actually presented to the to the cells using the major histocompatibility complex is presented to cd4 cells and cda cells and they recognize either the parts of the spike protein or the whole spike protein and then there's an immune response cellular and humeral immune response so this is the way so injecting mrna mrna becomes protein protein is partially digested presented to the immune system as foreign and then there is a reaction or or production of antibodies and cellular immunity and that's what converts the protection that we have seen recommended reading i i found uh actually jama the journal of american medical association um reviewed the most viewed articles so if you can go into the jama webpage and look at these they have many articles but one uh really struck me it's an editorial or a viewpoint from dr burbrick uh we have heard about like the social determinants of health and he elaborates on moral determinants of health so really very interesting very engaging reading of these of these papers i highly recommend is it doesn't it's not related to copy directly it's just direct uh you know related to to health in general and what he calls the moral determinants of health and finally uh don't forget today is the great conjunction of saturn and jupiter in the sky um this is a photo i took in my patio a couple of days ago so the two planets are gonna um are gonna be very close in the sky so i really uh invite you to do it this hasn't happened since since um the year 12 26 so so it's been it been more than 800 years since this two planet have looked so close in the sky so please uh tonight look at the look at the the sky for for a minute and look for this it's usually very close to the horizon uh looking west um you're gonna see and probably probably uh below the the moon the moon is is higher up and finally i'd like to thank everybody who's been in this um in this echo uh thank you really for helping me walk through this pandemic uh keeping me interested and motivated and sharing knowledge and learning from from you guys and thank you for for uh diaco project to give me this opportunity i just wanted to [Music] give everybody happy holidays thanks i'm going to start sharing here dr sosa i think we all want to thank you so much really it's i really want to thank you for helping me personally get through the pandemic you've been really a life source and i think a source for all of new mexico so thank you so much really thank you for your amazing uh teaching and wish you a happy new year um wanna move on to don't forget to continue to put in your great questions and wanted to move on to dr leslie hayes who's also been so instrumental leslie hayes is a family medicine physician and an addiction medicine physician in espanola with el centro family health all right can you guys hear me yes we can all right so for those of you who weren't here last week i asked um the providers in my organization and also on a cobit group on facebook what they had learned from the pandemic that they were going to continue to use afterwards and the questions the answers i got were just so interesting so i just enjoying them so a lot of people talked about the things they were going to learn about infection control and given how much controversy there is nationwide i was really surprised healthcare workers there was no question everybody was just like masks masks are great we're going to keep wearing masks so people talk they're going to wear mastering flu season possibly for the rest of their career all the time and then everybody should be wearing a mask when we have uri symptoms kids should wear a mask in school during flu and cold season children can be more resilient than we think they can wear masks all day at school while some adults can't wear one at the grocery store and people are talking about they just happily and blindly ran into rims in emergency medicine and i've always amazed we wear masks for the kids for rsv but when they were in the emergency room asked for them so but another comment was i touch my eyes way too much and to avoid hospital break rooms handshakes can go away forever blowing up birthday candles this one actually makes me sad i love birthday cakes i love birthday candles but and i didn't even think about it till people started talking about it but really it's kind of gross to blow all over a cake and then eat it schools are incubators of disease take children out of schools infectious diseases and children practically disappear and some of the practices such as hand washing before eating that people always said oh we can't possibly implement it maybe we can do them in the post covered world i love this one i recognize that my estimation of a 20 second hand wash was actually much shorter than an actual time 20 second hand wash i never realized how many times i licked my fingers in life turning pages opening up plastic produce bags etc it's kind of disgusting in retrospect i still haven't figured out how to properly open the plastic produce bags just taking me an extra 15 minutes at the grocery store to open them without licking my fingers handshakes time to do away with them i cringe when i think of how little i used to clean my stethoscope also the whole cleaning the stethoscope thing when those sand wipes are out it's so easy when you have to hunt them down it's much harder and at the very least get rid of ties meetings there are a lot of disagreement on meetings um many people were of the opinion we should never have an in-person meeting again um it's much easier to have visiting professor presentations virtually because you don't have to pay for travel zoom family meetups are a nice way to connect with people there should be a lot less meeting you should go through email and meetings should make decisions information should go through email and then other people were like i really miss in person meetings more than anything it's too easy to get distracted with zoom i love zoom meetings i can just you know pause in the middle of my rounds and then go back and finish seeing patients i remember everybody's names and there's no travel to cities i don't love visiting i definitely think this is true somebody commented that every meeting should at least have a zoom option and then people deciding whether or not to have their videos on or off the weekly department meeting is much better attended now um people talked about conferences and annual assemblies being virtual not perfect and you miss out on some stuff if it's not in person but it's really much more convenient you can play the sessions back and you don't miss sessions because they overlap and your money goes a lot further and then one comment that all board certifying agencies should just give all of the physicians and physician assistants and nurse practitioners maintenance of certification credit for this year because we've all spent so much time learning so many different things and then some consume meeting disadvantages there's no boundaries for work-life balances so many 7 am and 6 pm meetings and then somebody said just you know it made her sad that um people didn't want visitors or in-person um meetings to continue and so much of the humanity in medicine is that personal connection and then there are some interesting comments about visitors um and many people were saying they actually wanted to continue to limit visitors even after the pandemic maybe not a popular view but it's nice not having spouses present ov visits the office runs much more efficiently without guests or kids so nice not to have arguing parents grandparents and sibs in the room no parents coming back to the or to put the kids to sleep the kids do so much better without them it is much easier to take care of patients with a single family member in the room rather than finding my way through a crowd without extra visitors i can ask personal questions about safety and trauma without asking the parent or partner to leave and i think it's definitely something worth looking at of you know putting limits on the visitors i know when i was in the hospital i found i slept much much more than i did whenever i had visitors and i just i could focus on recovery so but this comment i think was really really important no one should ever be made to die alone in a pandemic and i'm gonna go through one more thing here self-care um taking time off when you're sick does not make you weak a lot of people commented there's no reason to wear anything but scrubs to work ever again the importance of self-care allowing people grace during difficult times and somebody commented that now that we're working from home so much it's often hard to ask for time off because it's just too easy to call in remotely a lot of people talking about biking to work to avoid public transportation and then never take any opportunity to see loved ones for granted before covet i almost didn't go to a friend's birthday party and they didn't know it would be the last time they could hug or see her same with visiting long-distance relatives no more i can just go next year and this was my absolute favorite comment how about women physicians to look great even without makeup dress clothes or high heels so and i'll go through the rest of them next week for two weeks thank you thank you dr hayes uh fantastic um and just a reminder that dr hayes also said yes we are not uh we're not gonna meet next week but we will we will meet the first monday in january thank you dr hayes super super interesting comments i think a lot of us can relate to many of those um and let's turn it over to marla sivers from new mexico department of health i know you've been really busy and have some updates possibly on the modern vaccine yeah thank you joanna just wanted to share a couple of updates about the approved or the eua authorized moderna vaccine a couple of differences i'll just highlight from the pfizer vaccine i think one of the most important being is that it doesn't require the ultra low uh cold storage so makes it a little easier for distribution and so our first shipments of the modern vaccine will be arriving in new mexico this week and that initial allotment the state of new mexico has earmarked for our long-term care facilities so our our initial moderna allotment will be earmarked for residents and staff in both nursing homes and licensed assisted living facilities and that vaccine distribution will happen through the federal pharmacy partnership with walgreens cvs and a local pharmacy group called vita pharmacy so we're looking forward to getting those vaccines distributed in long-term care facilities as you know they've been really disproportionately hit with not only cases among their residents and staff but deaths as well so hopeful that this is uh you know a positive sign for long-term care the moderna vaccine is approved for use in people 18 years and older so you remember the pfizer vaccine is approved for use in people age 16 and older so a change there or a difference and the madonna vaccine the second dose is administered four weeks later for the pfizer vaccine that's 21 days for moderna for weeks on modernist site they say one month the cdc site says four weeks hopefully they'll get a little more precise about that time period because i can already imagine all of the questions as you know does that mean 28 days 30 days 31 days so hopefully they tighten that up a little bit to just cut down on the confusion many things about the vaccine are the same they're also recommending that the vaccine not be co-administered with other vaccines and that you wait at least 14 days before or after receiving another vaccine [Music] the moderna vaccine is in a multi-dose bile that contains 10 doses it's not diluted unlike the pfizer vaccine um and same recommendations for vaccinating pregnant and lactating people uh people with immune compromise i think that was my only update for today thanks thank you so much thank you so much marla we so appreciate you coming on we know how incredibly busy you are and uh you do so on your own time and we're so appreciative um i think we have carissa uh colebrook on too and i just wanted to introduce carissa culbreth as one of the medical directors from tricore lab chris are you there hi i'm here can you hear me yes yes and i'm not sure you have any updates but just wanted to just want everyone to know that you're here if there's any questions about the laboratory testing or anything else that chris is on today thank you um great well let me um let me start some questions um and uh i think i might well i'm looking for the first question i think i might ask uh nestor or marla the first question and that um i think there's just there's either maybe there's not controversy but i think there is a difference in the two vaccines and that the moderna trials have um has have shown that um there is some um protection or lack of uh once once once patients are vaccinated with the moderna vaccine they're unable to kind of um spread the virus to others that there's kind of no shedding or there's no ability to spread but that hasn't been the case is my understanding with pfizer just yet can you kind of clarify that uh for for me or for us yes i can i can at least give some comments um yeah that's correct i mean pfizer uh did not mention anything about infection prevention there was one table in the document that um moderna sent to the to the fda in which they actually mentioned that before dose number two so patients got their first dose and when they went for the second dose they did a swap and they found 14 patients or 14 subjects with a positive pcr in the vaccine arm versus 38 positive pcr in the placebo meaning that there were more asymptomatic infections much more in the in the placebo than in the vaccine so the conclusion or the the the analysis of that data means that that at least it confers some protection and when you calculate vaccine efficacy in that very limited information is around 66 so there's a around 60 to 70 percent prevention of asymptomatic infection but this is very limited you know it's just one one swap in day you know vaccine day number two or or yeah vaccination day number two um what pfizer mentioned in their paper was that they they are going to do serology and they're going to do they're going to present an analysis on the serological conversion of those vaccinated with the placebo and the vaccine and they're going to know if there was more asymptomatic infection in the placebo than the vaccine but they haven't really done that they're probably running the test right now to be able to to publish or communicate that information so that's that's all we know but you're right pfeister has not really revealed how the ability of the vaccine to prevent infection moderna very limited information 14 against 38 uh from you know 13 000 um people who receive the the vaccine or the placebo um approximately so uh my my personal take is that there there is going to be some effect in in in viral infection we just have to really look at more data to see how much and how significant it's going to be that uh reducing the the the pandemic or the the reality in a population based uh uh situation thank you thank you nestor i mean if you think about any of the other you know if you think about polio or measles or monks mumps or any kind of large vaccination programs the thinking is that you're probably not going to be able to transmit the disease once you're fully vaccinated but i guess the the truth will be in huge large scale vaccinations and see what happens is that right okay and i just wanted to let you know i wanted to introduce we have folks on today from peru and nigeria and welcome welcome to you all um so i think we answered dona um orgaron's questions about the mutation from britain nestor sosa did um and we have a question from a rick foster a rick would you like to unmute and ask your question about the neutralizing antibodies yeah thank you two brief ones how does the neutralizing antibody which is the one that is going to cure you relate to the igg antibody that we test for and is there an update on how long that uh post-infection immunity may be conferred yeah i can i can answer there have been a few studies in which they actually uh determine igg antibodies so general antibodies against anything any part of the virus versus a specific neutralizing antibody which are usually directed against the spike protein and there is a correlation and carissa can can also help me there is a correlation so when when a person develops general antibodies within those antibodies there is a subpopulation of of really effective neutralizing antibodies so there's a general correlation um so so it's it's it's a yes the question there is there is correlation the the the second part of the question the duration we still don't know i mean with the the latest study uh earlier studies show that there was a decline in the antibody production but i think the feeling of the experts now based on the latest publication is that the high fly for those antibodies is pretty long we're talking 160 days half life so it's going to last much longer to to decrease and also uh we are encouraged by the fact that that the immune system has these memory cells both memory t cells and memory b cells that although they may not be producing antibodies or actively circulating in the blood they're hiding in the in the lymph nodes waiting for the virus to enter and once you get exposed to the virus the the reaction kicks in there's like a like a mnemonic or memory reaction with newer antibody production and also uh t t-cell response so so the hope is that at least for for you know a good several months we're going to have uh protection we don't know further than that because there's no really uh long-term studies the bodies have been around only for less than a year or or a bit over a year so so um so we don't know but at least from the kinetics of the curve of antibody the slope is really very slow so you can you can make that there it's going to last for a few months um hopefully enough to to control the pandemic yeah just an fyi i actually had coveted and i had two eliza tests one in may was 3.69 and i just had one two weeks ago it was 3.64 so that's seven months that's pretty good you're hanging in there good that's good that's very good thank you so much rick seems like you're you're doing well yeah um thank you for the for the great question rick uh carissa did you want to add to anything that that nestor said no uh nestor hit it right on the head um we had a study that we conducted at our facility um among a very small study about 35 patients that had a positive antibody test and looked at the presence of neutralizing antibodies in those patients with a collaborator from the university and found that neutralizing antibodies were detected in a good number of the population i think about 70 of the people that had antibodies we detected neutralizing antibodies in and there was a good correlation between the signal to cut off ratio that's generated by the base the antibody igg screen compared to the neutralizing antibody titers thank thanks carissa thanks rick for the great question um jeffrey miller had a question that i think early on in the epidemic we talked about quite a bit which was ivermectin um and just wanted to ask you nestor have you seen any recent articles on the benefits of ibermectin um or not so much in recent literature right yeah there was a publication a retrospective a study from from florida in which they found some benefits of ivermectin in hospitalization but this was really early in the pandemic people were getting acetomycin hydroxychloroquine it was really not a very uh pristine methodologically speaking pristine trial there was also study from bangladesh and and more recently and this is completely off the record investigators in colombia actually told me that they completed a randomized double-blind placebo control story with over 400 subjects and they found no benefits in early copy so i think there's a mixed bag we haven't really seen any any conclusive evidence in favor or against but most of the societies like idsa nih are not incorporated number mectin based on what is available so i think we need to wait for the publication of the studies but you know talking to these colombian colleagues uh my my bias is that it's not going to be um you know a miracle cure it's you know they did a very well designed study and showed no benefit early on so um it's it's unfortunate but i think that that's the way it's going to be thank you nestor i think we can uh plan not to use either ivermectin anytime soon right now thanks for the great question though and then we had some questions about from donna or goran and john foster earlier when you were talking nestor about you know what was going on with that mutation in the in the uk is it really due to that gene mutation or could there be an could there be just could there have been one or two super spreader events that might have caused kind of the outbreak and and then a trevor hawkins asked could there be a fitness cost to the mutations that would make the virus less virulent that kind of a different kind of question so wanted to get your take on those yeah those are a great question i don't think we have the answer for all of them i mean we can sort of uh analyze the situation obviously it doesn't seems to affect the fitness because it's it's going up if you look at the frequency it's becoming more prevalent in in some areas in the uk so at least it doesn't look like it's uh you know it's a weak virus or or a virus that is not able to infect humans um the the why why it it occur we don't really know i mean there i've i've reviewed three articles on the weekend um on this thing and and people think that it may be the pressure of of of using convalescent plasma in some cases that there is there is a similar strain isolated in south africa and and we have seen a virus evolution within us a person within a patient especially immunosuppress you give them plasma and the virus keep changing or mutating like we we used to see this with hiv all the time that that you put patients on therapy monotherapy therapy and the virus just keeps evolving more and more resistant so something similar may have occurred with some of these viruses the more they interact with the human immune system the more mutation they accumulate and some of those mutations help them um fare better so so you know that that's that's what we know we still have there's a lot of experiments and verification that they need to do to answer these these questions one question that i saw uh about this same subject so i'm going to just ask it and and carissa can help me they in one of the publications one of the late press publications they mentioned that because this affects the spike protein um it may affect the sensitivity of the of the pcr especially if you are if you are doing pcr tests of that section of the of the genome so um it it could it could happen so i do i don't know carissa have you heard anything and do you think it's it's is that possible because that's a concern they they they're asking like you know then we're not going to be able to detect if we use just a pcr that detects uh just the the the mrna for the rna for spike protein yes so actually the majority um we went back and looked at our assays our pcr assays actually when um the vaccine came out just to check to see if there would be any um cross reactivity between the vaccine and any of our assays and we know the vaccine also targets spike there's only one assay that we use in our laboratory and and spike tends to be a less common target for pcr testing so we only have one assay that we're using in our laboratory that targets spike many of the others target um the orf um one a and b or the n proteins um and so so it's less frequently recovered but in our our lab we are doing collaborations and many people are doing this across the country collaborations with individuals who are doing um sequencing of the virus to be able to identify common mutations and there's some databases that have the manufacturer primers and probes aligned with mutations that are being observed around the world to be able to see this proactively and so right now the mutation that's been observed is not aligning with any of the molecular assays most likely because spike is not commonly targeted thank you great um there's this is joanna again there's been a number of questions about um kind of vaccines for healthcare workers that might work not in hospitals but in kind of more solo or small practices not so getting the vaccine for themselves but also how they can start looking to kind of access the vaccine for their patients and i'm wondering if maybe marla might be able to start to speak on that perhaps if she might have kind of answers to that now that we have both the visor and moderna vaccine sure i can uh let you know uh what the plans are that are underway um so new mexico published our draft vaccine plan um actually on our cv.nm health.org website so if you've not taken a look at that there's a short kind of executive summary and then the longer plan kind of lays out what new mexico's plans are for prioritization of different groups um and you know for this very first tier where vaccine supply is very limited you know targeting obviously those front-line health care workers um primarily in hospitals who are taking care of hospitalized patients um and then people in long-term care settings as we discussed then as more vaccine supply becomes available in the next few weeks you know then we're looking at moving down into sort of from tier one a to tier one b which looks at you know other healthcare workers and people in other congregate settings as being a priority group and then expanding from there you know week from weeks so the goal is of course to get as many people vaccinated as possible as quickly as possible part of that just depends on how much vaccine is coming into the state and it's not uh you know really in our control we get an allocation each week from the federal government and we don't know until right before it happens how much we'll be getting and so those decisions about uh priority distribution have to be made as we get that information week to week however the way to get plugged in to vaccine availability is through our immunization program and so i think this week insists the new mexico vaccine registry if you're a vaccine provider with the state of new mexico there was uh new features in cis to be able to start um kind of pre-ordering vaccine so looking at how many healthcare workers you have in in your facility who is at high risk who would you prioritize you know if you had vaccine available so starting to gather that information more widespread from you know all private practices you know physicians offices um hospitals other health care settings so trying to really anticipate what that need will be for rolling that out and so log into your sis portal and look for that those new features to be available where you can start to communicate what your vaccine needs are going to be if you're not already a vaccine provider with the state of new mexico reach out to our vaccine program and there's a dedicated email address for that and it's covid dot vaccines at state dot n m dot u s so you can reach out to the program directly using that email address and get some more information about how to get plugged into vaccine distribution if you're not already participating in the statewide program and then as more vaccine becomes available especially the modern vaccine which is easier to distribute you know what we hope to see is that you'll be able to get a vaccine through a provider like walgreens or cvs a pharmacy provider the way you do now you know for your flu shot or your or your tetanus shot that sort of thing um so like i said the goal is to make sure as many people are getting vaccinated as quickly as possible but it's really just the constraint on supply that's going to dictate sort of how that rolls out and the public health offices will also be involved in vaccine distribution so as we start to move to the next priority groups and looking at people like ems and other first responders the public health offices throughout the regions will be taking a lead role in helping distribute vaccine to those groups as well and so that's another option is um connecting with your local public health office especially if you're in one of the more rural areas of new mexico to talk to them about availability of vaccine clinics when they think that will be happening and how to make sure that you know when it's going to happen so you can be plugged into those resources marla outstanding thank you so much for that update i think you answered uh literally about eight questions there and i think many more that uh people did not check but were thinking in their mind um do you mind just chatting to uh do you mind just typing in in the chat that um that email or web website if you don't already are not hooked into vaccinations um you know the address that you could yes i will do that and i see there's another question about um adverse event reporting right so i'll just touch on that quickly so there's you know there's the vaccine adverse event reporting system um by fda which will be very important for monitoring adverse reactions there's also a new web app um for people who get the vaccine so it um is based on your smartphone it's called v safe it's optional but people can opt into it and it's sort of a real-time surveillance system for adverse events so you'll get your first message about your vaccine experience how you're feeling after having the vaccine within two hours of receiving it and then uh daily thereafter and you'll be uh monitored for several weeks so those will be two primary uh sources for tracking those adverse events and then also again through the vaccine program at department of health thanks thanks marla um marla i know this the cdc you know um shortly after their criteria for how they were going to vaccinate the u.s population came out meaning the healthcare frontline healthcare providers and and then nursing home people in nursing home in congress setting second they then added another kind of category whereby elderly and fair individuals who are living in multi-family housing whereby their their younger their their kids and grandkids who are taking care of them who who might be at risk for giving their elderly patients elderly family members covet would qualify under kind of that nursing home category is new mexico going to stick with that same criteria yeah if you look at the draft plan we submitted you know it was sort of um high-risk folks you know with underlying health conditions or people who were elderly but not living in sort of institutional settings uh were in that sort of late phase 1b tier you know phase 1b moving into phase 1c i think it's tricky right how do you identify those people and i think that's where the healthcare providers who are seeing people in private practice are going to be important with helping identify those folks and making sure they get plugged get plugged into that whether it's through a pharmacy through the um health department or in their own office so i think that's primarily how we'll be able to identify those folks but yeah it's a question and the same question has come up about people who you know work in um not necessarily in health care but other essential industries right because that's another group that's been talked about as being prioritized and so how will you identify those people and make sure that they really get appropriately placed in line so i think um that's one of those things that's going to be sort of challenging uh to make sure we're getting to the right people thanks marla um really appreciate it just want to get to one or two more questions before we i have some closing comments there was a question about um when there might be studies or when we might be able to vaccinate those younger than 16. um nestor do you know of any studies underway or when that might be done no i just know that uh for instance pfizer included some patients 12 to 5 to 15 in their study but they didn't analyze that data they didn't present it and i know moderna said that they were going to start studies and younger so i think uh 2021 the first half of 2021 would there probably be be testing and and i think that the you know knowing that that it's safe and effective in adults is going to simplify the work in in children they sometimes they do just correlates or protection so if children receive the vaccine in a small group and and there's no significant side effects and they mount an immune response you don't need to enroll you know 40 000 60 000 children in a study you can do it with with somewhat uh less numbers of of of subjects based on the data from the adults but they they need to do it but probably not as as difficult as it was the first few studies joanna could i just add um for pregnant and lactating women acog has come out with a statement saying that it should be a discussion between the patient and their provider and um that there have been um several pregnant patients people who got pregnant despite everything in the studies who have done fine so far so we should not just say no um that they shouldn't get them because pregnant women are definitely more at risk from covid that's what i understand um is that more pregnant women are taking it than not so but that it is a decision that is between the uh with the ob gy and our family medicine doc and their patient thanks leslie really important and there's one more question about the vaccines given to prisoners and those in other congregate settings marla can you answer that uh yeah my understanding uh based again upon you know our draft vaccine plan was that people living in other high-risk congregate settings were going to be in the next group so sort of the phase 1b thank you marla well wanted to remind everybody that all the sets of slides are in the chat so please look for them as is your cme link is in the chat actually again it's it was in the chat at 45 minutes after the hour and kent noseworthy our digital librarian just put it in the the chat now um the cme link even if you do not need cme and if you have a few extra minutes please fill it out um dr uh tomati who is leading the focus groups uh wants to thank you if you've been able to participate in them and nestor and carla and and i and leslie also want to thank you very very much wanted to remind you all that we will follow up the first monday um in january we won't be meeting next week our other programs this week the first responder and critical care are not are not going to be held we're kind of off the rest of the week and then i also wanted to just let you know that we're starting a a climate change in human health echo uh mid february we have speakers from uh noah from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration from the national institute of environmental sciences from the cdc from the yale climate uh change center many speakers all over the country speaking eight consecutive weeks from mid february to mid april on wednesdays at 10 a.m i'll give you more information after the first of the year but mainly just wanted to thank you all uh for participating and being our colleagues and have a wonderful and safe and restful and happy new year thank you you,,12/21/2020
32,good afternoon everyone welcome to the covid19 infectious diseases office hours we're so happy to see everybody happy new year to everyone um we missed you and uh we'll go ahead and get started today i think we'll have a lot of a lot of uh good interactions so we ask that you turn that you leave your camera on if you have one just because we feel like it really helps us build community and we like to see people's faces so please leave those on if you have them um i'm going to go ahead and do our introductions of our hub team in just a minute if you have questions during this session please put them into the chat box and we'll try to get to all the questions that we possibly can we ask that you refrain from answering questions that are directed at the hub team unless we ask you to answer them so thank you for doing that and ken our digital librarian is here today he'll be putting all sorts of interesting things into the chat so please keep an eye out for those as well so i want to first start by introducing my um co-facilitator joanna councilman joanna do you want to introduce yourself hi everybody joanna castman here i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm happy new year and hope everyone is staying safe thanks thank you joanna and i'm going to i'll do introductions at the hub team we have everybody here today which is exciting dr salsa dr colbray um marla sivers is here and also leslie hayes uh dr leslie hayes so we'll have them introduce themselves when they give their initial presentation um and then we'll go to questions but please um if you have a question at any point just put into the chat and we'll start with questions after the um presentations so dr sosa would you like to introduce yourself first hey nestor you're you're muted sorry sorry only one weekend i'm doing this i already lost my abilities happy new year to everybody and and it's it's a pleasure for me to be here i'm the division chief of infectious disease here at unm uh hospital so i'm gonna start sharing my screen and and um giving you a brief update i really like to go into the question and answer session because i'm sure there are many many interesting questions uh coming in the future let me just just one second my computer is kind of slow today there you go can you all see my slides okay perfect so let's let's start obviously the the number one uh sort of headline is the uk variant so i'm although i mentioned it i think in the last office hours i'm just going to go over what we know because we have a little bit more information about it and the initial information that we had was basically a press release uh or a comment from a group um in the uk but now there are a couple of preprint publications so we will soon have uh you know more scientific verifiable data about this uk so i'm going to go over some of the information that that we know um and first of all this is really nothing surprising now and this this complicated graph is basically the spike protein and all the mutations that have been reported in the literature and you can see that some of these mutations are associated either with circulation in humans and that's something that it's going to happen when the virus goes from one person to the other or even within a person it's going to mutate and change sometimes to escape the immune reaction that we we produce or um when it goes to another host like like the minks or or the the the ferrets in in the laboratory or even lions in in sews or or cats or dogs there are some mutations that are expected and we have seen this uh in in many publications but but obviously there's one uh important um variant and is the uk variant that has many uh changes in the spike protein and that's what has generated uh so much interest but it's really something that is expected that we knew it's going to happen at some point in fact the more genomic information you look the more changes you detect some of them are simply meaningless for the virus other will increase uh somehow the viral fitness so this this uh variant called uh b117 uh and there are a couple of other other uh names or numbers to identify but essentially it has 17 uh relevant mutations in the spike gene uh and again the mutations are in the yin not in the protein so so i if i say spike protein mutation is not it's not correct it's actually the yin is what mutates the protein changes as a consequence of that uh 14 of them are non-synonymous meaning that they translate into an amino acid substitution and it has an important deletion or a part of the of the genius is missing two uh um uh or six base pairs which is basically two amino acid in the protein and and some of this mutation apparently they have um uh implication biological implication and that's what's important for instance the mutation n501y which is which is the probably the most important in this and also in the in the variant that was detected in south africa this mutation increases the binding of the virus to the to the h2 receptor so in theory can be associated with a with a better transmissibility there's also another important mutation near the furing cleavage side the p61h and then the deletion that that and it's interesting because this deletion have been detected in patient treated with convalescent plasma or immunosuppressed patient that that have has had had the virus for a long time in their blood and and and after having the virus persistently in their in their system in their blood in the respiratory tract this deletion appears so so it seems to be sort of an immune scape or a strategy of the virus to escape the the immune detection by antibodies so all of these are are present in this uk variant and that's what so concerning for the biologists and and epidemiologists and in fact it can be um in some some commercially available pcr testing um is detected because the the the gene the the s gene is not amplified so they call it a drop out of the s gene and and carissa can probably clarify that when when she speaks but but it's a sort of a uh rapid way to to look for these uh for this specific variant uh if you have a lot of pcr that do not amplify the s gene um and finally probably the most important thing is that it increases the transmissibility and that's how being observed in the uk and in fact they there's a pre-publication by this group uh in the london school of of hygiene and tropical medicine in which they found uh in their in their modeling and their study that increases the transmissibility by 56 percent um the reassuring point is that they they look at hospitalizations and severity uh and and they found that there was no association with more severe disease so that's that's the good news the bad news is that it seems to be more readily transmitted transmitted and once it gets into a community it seems to become the prevalent the prevalent um uh variant or strain in in the community so it basically out competes all of the other all the other variants and in fact this this um mutation has that the old mutation the d614g substitution that we knew from previous studies that increased disabilities so it's sort of an improvement on top of of an improvement um and then there's this other uh publication that have been posted in biological uh org in which they go and and do like an analysis a geographic analysis of what's going on with the different strains in the uk and and essentially what's happening is that this new variant the b117 um the picture on the left on this map of england if you can see it's increasing it's expanding the the red the more red the the map is the more expansion of this uh of this strain as opposed to all of the other strains are in the blue area which are contracting or diminishing so so it's obviously substituting or or or or out competing as i said the other the other um variants and it's becoming the more prevalent especially in the south east of of england especially the areas around london and the other detail that i want to mention is that they calculated an r uh an rt and and for this specific variant is obviously more transmissible the rt is higher much higher than the rt observed with the with the other lineages that have been circulating in the uk um and as you know this this variant has been identified already in many other countries including uh different places here in the united states the other the other article that i i i'm really going to mention uh very superficially there have been a review article a short but very informative article about reactions to vaccines allergic reaction and because we are seeing these uh infrequent but but but important reactions with uh both with the physical vaccine and to a lesser degree with the monday vaccine i think it's worth it for all um clinicians or practitioners in this in these echo to take a look at these and essentially they mention all the type of reactions so we have immediate reactions and delay reactions some of them are obvious like side reactions etc but but what have been reported with the pfizer vaccine and as i said with the moderna have been um probably ig ige or non-ige and it's important to try to characterize and in fact the in this review article they they go over i i don't have it here but they go over some blood tests that need to be performed in order to distinguish an ige mediated reaction from a non-ige and what to do with the second dose so i really invite you to read this interesting review article about about vaccine reaction obviously it's a preliminary information but it's sort of uh give us a road map what to do especially if you're going to implement vaccination at some point in your community or with your patients and and finally i just want to mention something about a therapeutic that we have been sort of monitoring as you know we have already the rendezvous the dexamethasone the varicity which are uh have received eua approval and there is this um tosilisumab that we have discussed before which is the il-6 inhibitor it's a monoclonal antibody that it's supposed to decrease the inflammatory reaction so it should help the patient in the hospital the patient that has this inflammatory reaction to try to decrease the progression of the disease and in fact there was a publication on the 17th of december in the new england journal tosilisius map in patients hospitalized with copenhagen pneumonia of carlos salama this was a multi-center trial called the impacta trial which is one of the one of the largest trials with uh with this uh specific uh monoclonal um and uh it had a lot of uh minority they enrolled patients here in the united states and also in in different countries in latin america and africa uh it was a two to one randomization so two two to one the proportion of patients who got the tucsilicious map versus placebo and they essentially enrolled patients hospitalized with with moderate kobe so no no no patient on on high flow nasa cannula no b-pop c parts are just admitted with some uh with oxygen or even without oxygen and they gave a dose of eight milligrams per kilogram and that those could be could be repeated 80 to 24 hours later if they they saw if the investigator noticed no improvement in the in the patient they enrolled around 400 patients in in the two arms uh they ended up with like 200 in one arm and 115 in the other the the groups were well balanced most of the patients were category 3 which means that they were hospitalized receiving just oxygen by nasal mesocannula the age were around 56 in both arms and a lot of non-white races and ethnicities you can see 57 latino american alaska and 13 black 14 and only 11 were non-hispanic whites so so really a minority uh majority study um and the main results and and what is was statistically significant is that toscilicium was associated with decrease in the need for mechanical ventilation and death they basically combine the two outcomes uh progressing to mechanical ventilation or dying in a single sort of an outcome or composite outcome and they found 12 percent in the tosilicium arm versus almost 20 percent in the placebo and this was statistically significant with the decrease in the ratio and the hazard ratio of almost 50 percent um of decreasing the in the risk of progressing to to mechanical ventilation of that when you analyze only mortality there was no difference in mortality it was a statistically uh there was no no statistically significant difference so uh they they sort of come up with some hypothesis to explain that but it seems like the silicon map and this is something that has been seen in other studies uh decreases the inflammation and prevents the patient to to require requiring from requiring mechanical ventilation but not necessarily uh prevents mortality and is something that i don't think we understand i do not understand really clearly um this is the the curve interestingly enough this trial which was done more recently included patient in corticosteroids so 80 percent of the patient received glucocorticoids uh in the placebo and and and tosilesium arm and also more or less 78 receive uh some type of antiviral uh 52 percent were specifically received so this is more applicable to what we're doing in the hospital nowadays um so and and there's there's a review of all of the relevant uh publications that have been done with toshilisuma this also came out came out really recently and includes this impact a trial and you can see this is the the forest plot of mortality and you can see there's no mortality benefit in any of the study in the combatta impacta the back bay which are different severity and different inclusion criteria but no difference in mortality and when you look at mechanical ventilation or there's the combined output you can see that most of the studies are on the left of the of the of of the forest plot meaning that it favors dos elixima we're sort of reassuring the finding of the impact so this drug seems to to help um for some reason decreases the proportion of patients that go into mechanical ventilation but the end result the death at 28 days of any causes is not is not affected and that's the conclusion basically of the authors and finally uh for those who are seeing patients with long covet i strongly recommend the the british have produced this um guideline it's actually very complete guideline on on long term effects of kobe 19 it has many sections and how to evaluate the patient how to follow what type of intervention so i really um it's too expensive to review really but you can find it in the nice and the national institute health and care excellence there are like the the of usptf of the of the uk where they produce all these guidelines um uh evidence-based guidelines on how to manage and i thought this was really good and i'm gonna read it um you know more thoroughly and and uh so to learn how to how to manage this patient with long-term copy okay so that's it thank you very much thank you so much nestor um let's go ahead and move on to um leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself hi leslie hayes family physician and hang on just a second let me find my powerpoint shoot where did it go there it is um and i'm gonna go away from what i was talking about with the things people have learned from covid and uh just i wanted had some primary care updates i wanted to do this week and the first i just wanted to mention um before we had the covet epidemic we had the opioid epidemic and the opioid epidemic was getting better until we hit cobit and unfortunately it's gotten a whole lot worse over the last year and cdc sent out an advisory warning about a substantial increase in drug overdose tests primarily the living driven by um fentanyl which is manufactured in mexico and put into many things including oxycodone alprazolam and heroin they noticed a particular increase from march to may of this year when we started to do the mitigation things with covid which often any disruption in the supply will lead to an increase in overdose deaths because people end up getting drugs from a non-standard supplier so they don't know what they're getting um in addition there's been a lot more fentanyl on the west coast than there was before it was mostly an east coast issue up until this last year but now it's definitely involving a lot more in the west coast and there's also a significant increase in deaths involving methamphetamine so and here's just a map showing increase in drug overdose deaths new mexico actually had less than a lot of places we were definitely going down before covet hit so this was a little bit of a disappointment and things that the cdc recommends is increase the use of narcan or naloxone and overdose prevention education expand access to treatment for substance use disorders if anyone out there is a primary care provider not currently certified in buprenorphine i would encourage you to get your certification um expand contingency management for stimulate disorder and i'd love to see the insurance and medicaid the state start paying for contingency management intervene early with people who are at high risk for overdose and then improved detection of outposts overdose outbreaks due to fentanyl and um last time i checked the doh did not have the fentanyl strips do you know if doh is providing fentanyl strips at all at this time so that people can check their drugs to see if it contains fentanyl okay thanks because i haven't been able to find any place in the area where my patients can get it so and then i wanted to talk a little bit i mentioned the acog practice advisory um and i just wanted to go through it in a little more detail it's on vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against covid and acog states that they don't feel that kovid should be withheld from anyone who meets criteria for vaccination if you're a healthcare worker and you meet criteria because you're a front-line worker you should definitely get the vaccine if or it should not be withheld from you it should also be offered to anyone who is lactating if you're going to discuss it with the patient you want to discuss various things that um about the vaccine how much back cobit is there in your community if you have very low rates it's going to be different than if you're in a very high rate how effective the vaccine is how the risk of severe maternal disease pregnancy definitely is a risk factor for more severe disease and also that we really don't know safety of the pregnant patient in the fetus there were 23 patients in the pfizer study who got pregnant and there were two miscarriages both in the placebo group but it's really not enough for us to have any data we need the studies but um most of the major organizations say they don't expect it to have any adverse effects based on the way it works they did say though that a conversation with a clinician may be useful but it should not be required and make sure that people know the vaccines have not been tested in pregnant women pregnancy testing should not be a requirement prior to prior to giving the vaccine and we should support pregnant women who decline and one thing i want to mention um a big thing i've been seeing on social media is that the coveted vaccine causes infertility this is absolutely not true i know i've had a couple patients ask about it and it's useful to know why people are thinking about this and why this is not true i also think there are probably many young women who are declining the vaccine without asking us about it so i think it's worth bringing up but the reason actually is a little bit screwy which is apparently there are some amino acids in the covid spike protein that are similar to amino acids in the protein syncitin one and this is a vital protein in the placenta and the thought is that this will cause auto antibodies to attack the placenta and make women unable to maintain a pregnancy so even though there are some similar amino acids the actual spike protein and synsite and one are quite dissimilar antibodies to one are not going to affect the other the american society for reproductive medicine um states that they do not see any increased risk of infertility um will be associated with this nor do they think there will be any increase in first or second trimester loss um any increase in cell birth or congenital anomalies so they definitely recommended that the vaccine be offered in addition the covet itself is significant risk for infertility i believe this was the paper that dr sosa presented a few months ago on the um antiphospholipid antibodies in serum and antiphospholipid antibodies are found at half of all hospitalized patients in this study and antiphospholipid syndrome is a known risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes including infertility so covet itself can definitely contribute to infertility and then this was some really bad advice that i found online and i wouldn't bring it up except that it showed up on at least i swear a third of the timelines i saw on facebook within the last week and initially reading through it i was like well some of this isn't too bad it's just kind of you know basically be healthy sort of but then some of the stuff is really really bad advice and i i think it's important that we as medical providers talk to people about it and i will add that nothing in here had any um evidence space at all behind it so i'm not going to read it out loud just because i felt like my iq dropped a point every time i read it but um i did want to go through some specific things that they mentioned um the first was that the woman talked about being on dexamethasone and zithromex she didn't say why she was placed on those but um i think it's important we talk to our patients about the deaths and methods on not being universally recommended especially not during the first week because i think people will read this and you know come to us and ask and then i have not been able to find any paper showing a benefit from zithromax and several that showed no benefit um she said that everyone should prone all the time i don't i was not able to find any studies where they've looked at anything outside of hospitalized patients with hypoxia it's probably unnecessary without lung involvement and i put this picture in as you can see they've had to do all sorts of propping to get this woman prone and proning is uncomfortable for people and just the idea of having people prone without necessarily having to just seems like people are already miserable enough from kobet let's not make them do something that's not going to be a benefit um and then they specifically advise that people should be walking and walking a lot with covid and we've known all for many years that it's not necessarily a good idea to be pushing exercise and recommendations from about five years ago from mayo clinic is that it's okay if your symptoms are above the neck such as congestion runny nose minor sore throat but not to exercise if you have symptoms below the neck such as chest congestion hacking cough or upset stomach don't exercise if you have fever fatigue or widespread muscle aches i would say at least 80 percent of my patients with covid um were not going to meet these criteria for exercise and in addition a covet has the extra burden that it has has myocarditis and the substantial percent of patients and we really don't want to be recommending that these patients exercise and you know there's a lot of talk about whether or not we need to do cardiac testing on everybody or just people with symptoms but for sure we don't want to be universally pushing everybody out to exercise even walking without at least talking to them about whether their symptoms are such that they should be walking and then the dumbest piece of advice that they had in there and i think this is actually the dumbest piece of advice that i've seen about covet and there's a lot of competition for this but they recommended that you set an alarm clock and wake up every two hours all night to go out and walk around and my very first night on call as an intern i woke up a patient to assess them and i remember the nurse threatened me with physical harm if i ever woke up another patient to first without a really good reason and i'm going to say that's usually good advice that there's rarely a good reason to wake up a sleeping sick person and um this is especially true for covid we're finding being sleep deprived worsens the outcome and that cobit 19 affects sleep um this article by james hamlin was actually better than anything i could find in the medical literature about the relationship between covid19 and sleep and i think it's well worth reading and then just some additional reading um there's a suggestion that the new um variant actually affects children more and that may be one of the reasons that they are not is going up this was actually a very sad piece from npr and i have not heard this from my fellow doctors in new mexico but i've definitely heard this from rural physicians elsewhere in the country that many people are saying they're going to leave their small community when they're done because um people are just not being very kind to medical providers across the country and then this was an article from the atlantic on the new virus and one of the things they said in there that was i had been taking some solace and the fact that the new virus at least does not increase the likelihood of bad disease but they said that um epidemiologists actually would prefer that the virus be more fatal and less transmissible because if you look at the exponential growth you're actually going to have more people die from an increase in are not than you would if the virus itself caused more severe disease and then this next one kelly gets a vaccine was just a very sweet book it's available as a pdf or you can actually order it as a book and it's for when the vaccine becomes available for kids how to talk to kids about the vaccine and then this last one was from dr seaver she sent it to me and i've been reading about individual reports about psychotic symptoms but apparently there are a significant number of patients less than one percent but enough that it's pretty scary who actually develop severe psychotic symptoms and you can get them weeks to months after covet and you don't necessarily have to have severe covid and i thought that was worth reading and that was everything i had thank you so much leslie um let's go to marla can you introduce yourself and if do you have any up you have any updates please you can give them now yeah something's going on with your audio um actually we still can't hear you marla unless other people can't but i can't really hear you you know what you might wanna um i'll have carissa introduce yourself do you wanna call in by the phone yeah okay and just stay on you can just stay on video but call in by your phone that would be awesome thank you all right um carissa i don't have you in my view here but i think you're still on i am can you hear me um yeah we can hear you now hi i'm christa culbreth medical director of infectious disease diagnostics at tricor i don't have anything to present today but happy to take any um questions great thank you all right so i think we'll um wait for just a minute for to let marley get on her on the phone just let me know harlow when you're on and we can actually go to a couple of questions i think before we have marla introduce herself um can i can i like regrout the the question that i post when i was presenting to carissa uh it's about the the s gene dropout is that an easy thing to detect i mean because i guess you can we can take like a quick look at all the pcrs you have you guys have done at tri core and see we have a lot of the so-called dropout i i don't really understand that much so i would appreciate if you can explain to us if it's very complicated to look at that and and if we can sort of a fast way to find the variant or at least something that has the this um deletion the thing um so from a diagnostic perspective we only have one assay um at tricor that detects the s gene um and that's the assay by diasoren called the simplexa assay um and we'd already been in conversation with the asorn as soon as the variant was identified and they've done in silico analysis and there's no um it's unlikely that their assay would be affected by the mutations they should be able to still detect because of where the primer binds in the gene the benefit for most of these assays and they were developed intentionally across all of the eua approved assays is that they all target two different genes and it was intentional because we didn't know early on what was going to happen with mutation within the virus and so that allows us to be able to identify the virus even if there are mutations that would affect the target binding region in our lab we have actually been able to identify a couple of other types of variants right the virus is going to have some small mutations because of some of the changes in that we've seen in the ct values of each of the different targets and so we have collaboration that we have ongoing to do sequencing anytime we see these types of anomalies of lower or higher ct values than we would expect in a specific target and so we work with unm the state lab and lanl to be able to sequence when we see discrepancies we also send out a number of our isolates to those same three groups for sequencing just across the board so that we would be able to see a variance in other targets and other regions if they begin to emerge in the state thank you very much uh marla are you ready what's that i'm reaching out to her to get it to call into the session thank you calvin um okay i'm gonna go ahead and turn it over to joanna to start with the questions and we can come back to marla when we get her audio great um thank you um so calvin uh just let me know when maybe marla's on or marla just let me know when you're on um thanks carla thanks nestor and and leslie and carissa fantastic um heather brislen are can you unmute and um ask your a question i think it's a question everybody is really interested in um yeah when you're vaccinated are you still able to transmit yeah exactly so i'm assuming you know when we vaccinate people with the flu vaccine we say this doesn't mean you won't catch it it just hopefully won't make you sick or it'll keep you from getting sick so for those of us that are seeing people get vaccinated or my mom that says you know now i don't have to wear a mask when i go to target those kinds of questions what do we know about transmission after you've been vaccinated yeah the information um that both modern and pfeister took to the to the fda for their for their approval really didn't look into transmission in in any you know in any significant way it was really i mean there was one um uh part of the study in the modern trial in which they actually did a pcr when the patients were gonna or the subjects were gonna be vaccinated for the second dose they did a pcr and they found that they were less positive in those who got the vaccine compared to the placebo so apparently the first dose did decrease the possibility of having a positive pcr on your second appointment for vaccine that was it they didn't do a formal analysis and they and that was sort of a efficacy around 60 so you can say that there are some very preliminary evidence that there's a decrease in the in the transmission but it's definitely nothing nothing uh dramatic um pfizer in fact didn't make any comments on that and they said that they were going to look at the serology because they did serology in different points of the study but they didn't analyze that data so they're gonna they're gonna know if they have been asymptomatic infections in the placebo and vaccine group but they haven't really uh analyzed that data that's gonna come out in the next few hopefully three weeks or months um when they start running those serology studies on the on the patients and then say okay those who were vaccinated did not seroconverted meaning they didn't even have uh asymptomatic infection the only thing that they look was symptomatic and severe disease and they showed this 94 95 efficacy in preventing disease very little except that that pcr test that was done on the second vaccination moderna we have no other really objective information on the prevention and transmission so we have to wait okay thank you really helpful thank you nestor and i'm happy to say that marla's back on so marla sivers uh it's all it's all you marlo two on you and meet yourself now star six okay can you hear me now yes we can hear you okay thanks sorry for all of the technical difficulties today i just wanted to uh briefly talk a little bit about vaccine roll out i anticipated there might be a lot of questions during this session about that um and while my division isn't primarily responsible for vaccine distribution um just wanted to sort of share what was happening that i'm aware of so over the weekend there was a big update to the vaccine registration portal so if you signed up a couple of weeks ago on the vaccine registration portal go back and visit it today it looks quite different there's a lot of new information that you can enter for your registration on the portal including underlying conditions your occupation there's several other occupation categories in more detail that's now allowed in the registration website so this is sort of a classic building the airplane while we're flying it situation but it has been updated i looked at it this morning when you first log on it asks you for a confirmation code um if by like me when you signed up you didn't get a confirmation code you can enter your email address and it will find that confirmation code and send it to you so that you can update your pre-registration so currently there's 230 000 people who've registered on the vaccine registration website the registration website is open to anyone and will be very useful the more people that we can get to use that website for registration rather than reaching out you know to hospitals pharmacies or their health care providers individually so that we have a single site for inventory tracking and management and we understand where the demand for vaccine is so that doses can be allocated appropriately so unless you're a hospital employee or employee of a long-term care center that already has a defined vaccine distribution point and plan please sign up on the new mexico department of health website for that vaccine registration i know when you first sign up it seems like nothing happens but i do work with a couple of people on my team one is a nurse down in the las cruces area and her partner who's an emt who signed up on the vaccine website um when it first came live and then on friday both got in a text message letting them know that vaccine was available for them and got an event code and were able to go online and make an appointment right away to receive vaccine in their community interestingly they were directed to receive their vaccine at the walmart pharmacy in las cruces so that's just sort of an example of you know vaccine is being pushed out through multiple sources and signing up on the website is really your one stop shop to get connected to available doses in your area we're still in phase 1a of distribution so that you know very first priority group for healthcare workers who are providing direct care and first responders we've only received as of last week a little over 49 000 doses of vaccine in new mexico and most of those have already been given so currently a vaccine supply is quite limited we receive shipments from the feds from hhs each week but it's variable about how much we receive and when we receive it so you know as soon as we get vaccine the goal is to get it out and get it distributed and administered as quickly as possible but currently the supply is quite restrained so i know i've talked to several health care providers who are providing direct care who said you know i i signed up i said i was health care but i didn't get a vaccine appointment i think that's really just a function of the amount of vaccine that's available in the state at the moment so um the last update we received from the vaccine program internally was that we expect to be in this very first phase of rollout phase 1a probably for the most of the month of january before we start sort of moving down that priority list a little bit more and i don't know leslie if you have experience from your clinic with vaccine distribution that you can share but things are rolling out and i think having a lot of vaccine arrive um during the holidays kind of didn't help us get this rolled out as quickly as we would like since we got shipments you know the week of christmas and the week of new year's so we would expect in the next couple of weeks for things to really start to ramp up and i know many of the federal vaccine partners cvs and walgreens that are working with long-term care have vaccine clinics that happened over the weekend and many scheduled for this week so we expect the rollout to be increasing in speed that was all i had today thanks so we are a vaccine site and i gotta say compared to all of the people on my physician groups on facebook it is going very much smoother in new mexico than anywhere else seems to have gone and um i will also add that seeing people come in for the vaccine is the happiest group of patients i have seen in 25 years of working here it's people are so happy to get this vaccine so but it's gone very smoothly from our standpoint so marla leslie thank you so much oh marla fantastic good to see you uh in person and on the phone with clarity um i'm gonna just while you're well you have such good uh i.t support i'm gonna go and ask you a few questions right now um um there's a lot of folks as you know on this call that are not from new mexico can you just um remark whether this is a new mexico what you're speaking about is is for new mexico um residents or can other residents from other states sign up for this that was a question yeah so it is specifically for new mexico um and other states may have their own sort of portal to do this vaccine sign up but the one i'm referring to here is specifically for new mexico residents thanks marla and that was another question another question is are are other states working through their departments of health in a similar fashion or is it extremely variable or many states doing very similar work that you're doing marla it's extremely variable you know cdc put out some broad guidelines for how vaccines should be prioritized and distributed but each state have the opportunity to to make their own rollout plan and prioritization and so it does vary from state to state you know but i think what leslie said you know things seem to be going a bit more smoothly here in new mexico than we've seen in some other states um you know florida comes to mind uh their vaccine rollout has been quite bumpy in the way that they did that so it is really really variable right now um because we don't have a unified you know vaccine distribution plan at the national level right thanks marla um another question that might be for for you and or carissa um possibly nester too from from carol hennessy is there a planner protocol to get antibody testing after each vaccine dose um i guess to see if the patient um developed you know made neutralizing antibodies also does it affect the pcr test once someone has been vaccinated let me take the some part of the question can you hear me yes yes yes so so no i don't think there's any plans to measure antibodies i mean the efficacy was so high in the clinical studies with 40 000 patients 30 000 patients that and the and the protection you know real life protection was so strong for severe disease and for for disease in general that it's probably not necessary i mean it's not necessarily unless you want it for research purposes or to do something further but really i mean it's one of the most efficacious at least in in the on paper one of the multiplication vaccine that we have maybe similar to some other live virus vaccine that we that we have in the on the market so no i don't think there's any any um any need for antibodies unless unless you you have your personal curiosity or something but it's so effective at least on on the studies and and uh the second question was regarding the pcr right how it how it might affect the pcr test once you right it shouldn't it shouldn't because number one the most of the rna it's injected into the muscle not really in the respiratory tract and and as karissa said sometimes this pcr actually detect more than one um section of the virus and we're just injecting one the spike protein so it's very unlikely that that mrna is going to show up in the throat or in the nose of a person very very unlikely what you're going to have at some point is antibodies to the spike protein so if you want to know if you had a natural infection after vaccination you probably have to look for other antibodies like nuclear protein something that we do with hepatitis b that we look for for different parts of the of the virus to know if you were vaccinated or or or or if you had natural infection the same is going to be with with the with the spy protein but with most of the spike protein vaccines but but no the pcr should not be um positive at any point if you have a positive pcr they were unfortunately infected despite the vaccination thanks nestor carissa do you have anything to add on that no that's exactly correct um and many of the antibody tests are monoclonal antibodies so they're two specific targets if one does want to use an antibody test to check vaccination status you would need to identify what target was used for the antibody test and so i just i think it would be a very messy approach and it's not something that we do to check immunity to any other vaccine really save just a couple that we use um so it's just not recommended very helpful thank you i wanted to add on what dr sosa said that for people who get symptoms that last more than 48 hours after getting the vaccine you do want to check the pcr because there have been a fair number of people who have gotten the vaccine only to discover they were infected in the week before so don't just automatically assume that it's related to the vaccine if people get symptoms so very helpful very helpful uh leslie and that brings me to another question by lisa kutchen and says if someone has had covet is it recommended that they still receive the vaccine and if so how long after kobot should one wait to get the vaccine i know this one so this is leslie the current recommendation is it can be given as soon as the symptoms have resolved um but because there's such a shortage of the vaccine and people who have had covedor seem to be nine immune for 90 days they're recommending waiting the 90 days and then getting after that thank you thank you a question from martha d'ambrosio have mederna or pfizer provided any information on the action of the on on the efficacy of the of the of their vaccines against this new variant do you know if anything's come out um publicly not yet i haven't seen anything published but i i saw a declaration by i think the the biontech ceo saying that they were doing the experiments that they are looking into that uh and it was a matter of a couple of weeks that's what he said to the press great um uh and and thanks carissa had to uh drop off we we appreciate dr culbreth's information um there's a question from rolando about um indomethacin um benefiting or not benefiting uh patients with cova-19 nester might you comment on that no i haven't seen anything on on in the meta scene i remember at the very beginning that was like many years ago uh the question of the french authorities and the use of ibuprofen but that has been basically debunked and people with copied or patience would covet can can take a nonsteroidal if they don't have a contraindication or acetaminophen for that matter if they feel ill i don't know about indometacina specifically to be honest i haven't read or heard anything great and then i have one more question then i'm going to turn it back over to carla um i've seen kind of in the uk a couple of different things that they're doing or one is that they want in order to maybe because of this new variant spread um perhaps delaying the second dose by a few weeks so that they can increase uh more more doses and and get more uh more people more citizens kind of uh more people vaccinated and one is kind of just some anecdotes of mixing the uh visor with pfizer the first vaccine second the madarina or just some you know some conversation about that and and yehuda pat also asked that question can you respond to that nestor yeah i'm yeah it's it's kind of hard i mean i've seen that i was surprised to see that from the from the authorities in the uk because we have been you know fighting to to you know to respect the evidence and science and all these and all of a sudden uh we are looking at non-really scientific or no data based decisions based on the situation in the uk et cetera but i think we don't have information to answer any of those questions can we give half of those can we give we just want those uh can we space the doses more than what the study showed all of those are interesting questions they may help solve an epidemiological problem or a short-term vaccine problem but they're not based on the data i mean we have the two large trials in which they did the vaccination in a very specific time frame using two doses everything else is just a speculation you know uh supposition on the on the part of the authorities it may be necessary i mean i remember like with yellow fever that's like when we had a yellow fever vaccine in africa uh they decided to to have the dose of the yellow fever vaccine to give it to more people and that was it was successful but again those are decisions that are made more out of desperation than based on science and i'm i am afraid that people are going to start i mean if they're questioning the vaccines as it is now with very robust trials in mind if we start huffling the dolls or or spacing it you know three months or something people are going to be more confused in my opinion but i you know it's hard for me to and i think pfizer has already pronounced that they do not recommend um doing any of the what the uk suggested obviously right it's it's a little i mean it really questions kind of what why we have even uh you know food and drug administration and advisory panels and robust you know phase one to three testing right you know so but i'm going to turn it over to carla uh thank you nestor so much thank you joanna and i just wanted to um say you know there are so many questions about the vaccine in the chat there's a lot of them so we'll definitely the ones that don't get answered we'll keep them and we'll just answer that i mean ask them first next week um there's been a i a couple of people contacted me offline and they're i believe there was something in the chat too about people uh specifically marla in new mexico who signed up through the website and then had got called over the weekend or got notified who didn't have any pre-existing conditions really wouldn't have fit into phase 1a do you know what that was about or can you comment on that yeah interesting i saw a little bit about that um over the weekend as well and yeah i don't really know sort of how you know how that happened it might be something that the vaccine program can kind of trace back um through the website but yeah i thought that was interesting too okay but that's not something that's supposed to be happening it sounds like good okay um so i think kim joy asked this question a couple times so i want to make sure that ken that you felt like it got answered by nestor just a minute ago about but she said she was worried about the possibility of the decision to reduce the the vaccine to half dose to double the numbers kim do you feel like did you have any other questions about that or is that yeah i think my covet anxiety is just showing and yes he did answer it appropriately i just want to mention when they did the phase two stories uh before the large trial they used actually escalating those like like modern used 50 micrograms so half of those and he built antibodies but that's just you know laboratory there was no efficacy there were very few patients you know in the in the tens and not in the tens of thousands so so it's difficult to to uh to extrapolate you know what happened to 10 patients in a phase one or two study to a whole population so that that's the the sort of the leap of faith that that we're being asked but but if you ask me 50 micrograms in those antibodies i still remember my slide with the it was very similar to 100 microgram in the in the but we don't know durability we don't know uh if that is going to be the same when you enroll a thousand or 10 000 patients to be honest thank you thank you nestor um there was a question very early on about uh one of our providers amy why said that patients are asking her to provide ivermectin do you have any thoughts about ivermectin or what is the data behind ivermectin yeah i don't know what's going on with our mech team but my my uh social media especially the spanish speaking social media is exploding with papers and things that they're sending me and this is how i summarize it i haven't seen a single well-designed double-blind placebo control study published in the literature in in a respectable journal there have been a lot of pre-prints uh communication summary of evidence by by groups which sometimes have like a hidden agenda that actually showed efficacy of vibramectin i think we need to wait for a good peer review large trial showing or not showing efficacy i can tell you off the record that there was a study in colombia um by by very reputable investigators and they didn't find and it was double blind placebo control early therapy using appromenting and they said that there were no uh no useful no no no benefit in the arm there is a publication a pre-publication from egypt 600 patients and they found that it was a miracle drug zero death zero progression zero zero zero across the board i don't know if that's real uh so we have to wait for it to be peer reviewed and published uh none of the none of the idsa nih cdc uh the european medication authority have given the blessing to ibraheem so i think it's a lot of a lot of speculation a lot of excitement on people who look at this pre-publication but nothing really solid that we can say yeah definitely this this is effective um and it's been published thank you very much nestor so as i mentioned we'll we're going to hold on to the rest of those questions um i have wanted to give a few minutes to my colleague winona weekley we know if you can unmute yourself and introduce yourself who is going to let you know about some information about referring outpatients to clinical trials here in new mexico um outside of the university and also we are going to put some information in the chat of slides a couple of slides to give a little bit more detail about that in those clinical trials well now can you unmute yourself i think can you hear me yeah okay good afternoon everyone happy new year um i'll be brief because i know we're coming close to one o'clock um i'm here with my colleague dr linda gorgos our principal investigator kate morton our clinical pharmacist we are access research uh we were on a call a couple of weeks ago and introduced ourselves we're a santa fe based research program with a background particularly in infectious disease our team is comprised of experienced doctors nurse practitioners clinical pharmacists i'm a nurse we have coordinators and what we wanted to let people know is that we are now officially able to offer access to outpatient clinical trials for covid we are currently enrolling two trials and we have two or three more that will be quickly on the books we believe uh one is the remdessevier trial for outpatients specifically and the other is a monoclonal antibody so we are anticipating having access to an oral therapy and possibly an inhaled treatment as well as a vaccine in the next month we operate seven days a week to make sure that patients have access i know that there have been some challenges in settings where infusion sites are only open monday through friday with limited operating hours we do have on-site rapid antigen and pcr testing available for patients where you have a high index of suspicion and they don't actually have a result available patients do not need to be in a particular health system they can be from anywhere in the region they can be referred it doesn't matter if they're unm patient or a first nations patient or a presbyterian they can be a patient from any setting i think that it's important for us to be clear that patients don't have to pay for any of the assessment or the treatment so labs the medical assessments associated with their uh participation in the study patients um that we would accept as referrals for studies are patients who don't require hospitalization so this is different than what's being offered at unm for example or anything offered in the inpatient setting if a patient is anticipated to be hospitalized please make sure that they get uh referred appropriately we would not be able to enroll them our studies are strictly for the outpatient setting a patient needs a positive covid test within a week of the referral as well as at least one symptom should be 18 years of of age or over pardon me 18 years of age with an underlying medical condition or over 55 years of age and again they shouldn't need hospitalization or outpatient oxygen if you want to refer a patient please feel free to call us and we can walk through the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria on the telephone before you refer someone especially if you're referring from outside the immediate santa fe area all of our studies of course are fda and irb approved this study design typically includes randomization to a placebo arm as a possibility so depending on the study they may be randomized one to one uh oh looks like like we lost them um we lost your your audio we know it but um we put the link into the chat it has the oh we obviously did it uh we lost you for a little bit there oh okay yeah what was the last thing you've heard i'm not sure we just have one minute left but we the slides are in the chat um okay and so if people have questions they can definitely call you right yes please call us um feel free to call we have uh the telephones are available 24 7 before you refer a patient but again we do accept calls um and we will accept referrals on the weekend as well so if you the last slide has our contact information the phone number is the same for all of us with our address and our fax number and then the inclusion criteria is also in there and we can sort of um finesse the inclusion criteria based on the study specific requirements so but please feel free to give us a call before you refer someone to ensure that they won't get here and have to be turned away last point would be that patients will be compensated for the time for their time and travel so if patients are concerned about having to travel to santa fe the stipends um are available to patients who do become participants in the trial excellent thank you so much and when i was usually on this call so if you have other questions next week you can probably um you can chat her then as well but the the information will be in the is on the slides to contact them so i know we're right at the top of the hour i just wanted to have a couple of a couple of announcements the cme link went into the chat just a little bit ago we would love to hear your feedback um our first responder resiliency echo is not happening today because of the just coming back from the holidays but they'll start back up again on monday the january 11th and we do have a critical care echo this week on thursday from eight to nine with dr michelle harkins and the topic is going to be um coven 19 diagnostics by one of our faculty kathy petty so that should be very interesting if you're interested in joining that echo at eight o'clock on on thursday and without further ado um we'll go ahead and disconnect thank you so much everyone for joining and we'll see you we'll see you next week oh what was that i was going to remind you that we won't have a session on the 18th oh i'm sorry yeah i for i was going to mention that so that's martin luther king holiday and we unm is actually closed so we will not have a session on january 18. thank you joan okay bye-bye you,,1/4/2021
33,can you hear me great okay well welcome to today's office hours echo it's um monday january 11th i'd like to introduce my i'm joanna katzman from project echo i'm a neurologist and and work both at echo and and the unm pain center i'd like to introduce my colleague carla thornton carla do you want to say hi hi thanks joanna hi everyone carla clarkson here infectious diseases at unm and project echo great carla next i'd like to just go over a couple housekeeping items um it's so great to see so many of you back i hope everyone is is doing okay and staying as safe as they can um if you are on video that's great if you're not on video but do have the opportunity to turn on your camera that would be fantastic we always love to see everybody and it helps us to be able to communicate with you better in in the echo model we we also have a wonderful digital librarian many of you know by now kent noseworthy is his name and he will be putting many evidence-based and evidence-guided information into the chat so you can just take uh information directly off the chat for your uh information for your perusal at time of your convenience also at about 45 minutes after the hour you will be receiving um a link for no cost for the no cost cme and if you if you don't need the cme it's also great for you to fill that out we do look at that with a lot of thoughtfulness and uh do try to improve the program upon your recommendations you will also be getting links to dr sosa and dr hayes powerpoint as well so without further delay i wanted to introduce our kind of our chief here dr nestor sosa nester love you to perhaps introduce yourself and i think he has another great powerpoint master thank you thank you joanna and thank you everybody for joining good afternoon let me share my screen here there you go can you hear me well if nestor if you don't introduce yourself i'm just going to let everybody know that you're the chief of infectious disease at unm health sciences center and we're so happy to have you lead us thank you thank you okay so let's let's start the update uh the first um paper that i want to review and it's actually more reference the paper than review the paper is this uh this article about the development and external validation of a prognostic tool for coping 19 critical disease you know since the beginning of the pandemic we have uh been trying to sort of um decide which patient uh are at higher risk or determine which patients are higher risk of progression of disease so this group from university of california in in urban or irvine california actually uh data validation cohort and then um a derivation cohort of patients and a validation cohort to try to come up with a with an easy web-based uh tool and and it's actually available so i'll give you the link in a second but they actually look at several characteristics which they thought were relevant to to the prognosis of the patients so they took some demographic characteristics some presenting vital signs the number of comorbidities and some laboratory values which are not that sophisticated uh the uc reactive protein procalcitonin troponin lact take dehydrogenase a percentage of lymphocytes and whites cell count a total of 13 uh parameters and they were able to sort of classified uh in critical and non-critical disease and incorporate that into a formula they actually uh calculated the the sensitivity and specificity of this tool that they they develop and have very high 90 sensitivity 89 in the derivation cohort which was a group of 87 patients and then they validated in another center in another hospital with a different group of patients and they found a very high sensitivity and 71's specificity and essentially this is the tool and this is the this is the link to this tool so if you have a patient and you want to sort of guesstimate how likely are these patients to be complicated or to end up in in icu or with mechanical ventilation you just impu input the values of all these 13 and you don't have to have all if you have several of them it will give you an estimate the more you have the more precise the tool is but you don't have to have everything and then you just hit submit and it'll give you a percentage uh risk of going into icu so i thought it was it was and it's free it's available online and it's from the university of california so it's an interesting relatively simple uh tool to calculate the risk and you can you know make decisions based on this and actually recommend patients to go to the to the hospital to be evaluated if you're in the outpatient setting or if you're already in the hospital this is a patient that probably is going to need more uh intensive care and can be used also as a as a tool to estimate how many people you you're going to have in the icu in the next few days uh depending where in which setting you use this uh analytical tool so i thought it was interesting and it is the first one that i see um not from china because we i have seen in the literature a couple of early tools from china but this is the first one done on patients here in two different centers in the united states the second the second uh sort of news that i want to share with you um and and and also a couple one paper actually uh was something that we already talked about in i think in the last session the and it was regarding this new variant this uh uk variant if it was uh susceptible to the antibodies that are induced by the pfizer vaccine and we have we have started to see uh in pre-publication uh phase some papers or laboratory work trying to address this question of how how effective or how efficacious the the physical and also modern vaccine are to this new variant so these are scientists which we did this really really rapidly they took a a wild type virus and they actually changed that key mutation in the in the receptor domain um of the of the virus so they substituted the amino acid 501 the end for y which is the what the the new variant has and they took blood or i'm sorry i'm sorry plasma or serum from 20 subjects that had been vaccinated and this was in collaboration with physics sufficer actually facilitated those um serum of patients that have been completely vaccinated with the with the physical biotech vaccine and as you can see these are the um the pr and t the the plague reduction neutralization test so it's a test of neutralization of this virus with this with the with the main mutation that is observed in the uk variant and and just to give you a long story short there was no not a decrease in the in the neutralization in fact it was an increase in the neutralization ability 1.46 times uh more neutralizing antibodies against the new variant compared to the old variant so good news um this is just one one of the of all of the 17 amino acids but but it's probably the most important uh because it's exactly in the area where the where the antibodies um uh recognize the the spike protein is the area of of the of the protein that attaches to the ace receptor so this is a very preliminary only 20 20 vaccines but encouraging nevertheless there's another story that i review but it was done in silico um actually they used you know a computational uh device to analyze the epitopes of the new variant and and and and antibody from convalescent plasma and they concluded that there was no uh significant impact on the on the attachment of the antibodies to the different epitopes of the new variant meaning that that probably um this this variant is not gonna it's not gonna escape the the antibodies that that people have developed with the natural infection so i think we're gonna have more information but at least it's a reassuring and they made this um article actually although it's a pre-print made it to the press to the lay press and a lot of people were commenting on these on this paper from from the researcher from from pfizer the the other the other um interesting um news regarding the the this uk varian or b117 was that the the public health england published the third technical briefing giving some more information about where the whether this new variant is localized in the united states i'm sorry in the uk but what i want to share with you is actually the attack rate they were able to calculate the the number of people who became infected once they be they were in contact with somebody harboring the the the new variant the the it's called blc 2020 12 or or 117 both both names are used interchangeably and you can see that the attack rate was 14.7 overall interesting this is a higher attack rate than than the other uh older viruses or older uh lineages or variants so it's and this is more or less a 30 33 higher um secondary attack rate and another more recent point i didn't highlight it but you can see here the group of of children 0 to 9 and 10 to 19 had also a higher attack rate 9 and 11.8 versus six point one and nine point six with uh with uh all uh viruses so so um this basically raised the concern that children may be more more susceptible to infection uh with these uh with this uk byron as you know has been identified already in the united states i think more than 52 patients in several different states so so those are like the most important or the more relevant findings from these third report by the public health england that i wanted to share with you they actually in this table they actually point out what they have done so far so they took clinical sample did the pcr sequence the virus uh try to isolate the virus and and confirm the sequence by genomic sequencing and now in blue is the things that they're going to do they're going to check the growth kinetics in in different systems in in vitro they're going to also uh do what we what i just presented if there's cross neutralization to the to the to the uh to the um with the antibodies that people have that have infection with all the variants and and with the vaccine uh and check the vaccine response so so those those uh data it's gonna come or will come in the next few days or weeks uh to get a more complete picture of what the meaning of these of the new new new variant uh the other topic that i wanted to to highlight was this publication by the cdc and the mmwr um in which they actually analyze the reactions reported to the adverse event reporting system the va beers there's or i don't know how they call it but it's vaccine adverse uh reporting system they actually uh collected information from the almost the first two million uh people vaccinated in the united states with the pfizer vaccine and they found a prevalence of anaphylactic reaction severe anaphylactic reaction of 11.1 per million or or one in a hundred thousand they had 21 cases of of severe anaphylactic reaction reported we remember we heard some from alaska et cetera so so they were able to analyze this um and and also important 71 of this anaphylactic reaction occur in the first 15 minutes of vaccination so these are our reactions that occur you know relatively rapidly so so making people wait 20 30 minutes makes sense to be able to detect the majority of these uh serious reaction um so and looking at the whole report they so out of almost 1.8 uh 1.9 um doses given there were 4 393 adverse events report so 0.2 of those vaccinated reported adverse events using the the v-a-r-v-a-e-r-s um and of those 175 were severe electric reaction and as i said 21 were considered anaphylactic reaction there were 86 non-anaphylactic allergic reaction other 61 other non-allergic reaction and seven that were still under investigation when they published the mnwr um so that gives the incidence of one in a hundred thousand or eleven in a million and regarding the time the anaphylactic reactions as as we said the great majority occur in the first 15 minutes there were a couple and a few that occur a little bit later and important some some of these patients that like blue are those who had a history of allergic reactions so they would obviously having having histories of allergy reaction before was a predisposing factor or was related to to having a an uh reaction these are the other allergic reactions non-anaphylactic also pretty rapidly the great majority you can see are under 30 uh 30 minutes so so these reactions occur really rapidly this is a sort of a detail of those anaphylactic and non-anaphylactic allergic reactions you can see that this occur overwhelmingly in female 90 of the per of the subjects that actually reacted with with allergy or anaphylaxis were were females it's much more common females and than male and as i said very rapidly occurs very rapidly the median age was related to the group that was vaccinated 40 years in these first 1.8 million people and this one although this is a very uh busy slide i just want to give you a feeling of of the type of allergy these people reported so so a lot of the people who had or the patients or subjects who had the the anaphylactic reaction have some pre-existing allergies very diverse allergic to tropical fruit to the rabies vaccine to sulfur to be to medications antibiotics wasp steam etc so you can see they all had some and interestingly enough a few had already had a previous anaphylactic reaction like this person had an affair when when he got the rabies vaccine with sulphur with jellyfish with copperazine etc with walnuts so although there was not a single um association there was um you know a lot of history of allergy in those uh subjects that actually reacted and you can see the description and i really refer you to the paper to see what type of reaction they had more more uh diffusary tomatoes rash and some difficulty with swelling of the tongue or the throat were the most common findings and unfortunately all of the all of the subjects recovered and were discharged home so that was that was good so that was the the allergic reaction and just to close uh there was a recent publication um january 6 um on on the use of convalescent plasma i mean i thought we were basically giving giving up on on convalescent plasma but this this group from argentina actually published a very well designed uh placebo control study in which they gave uh high tider plasma to patients and and and to some some patients and then they gave placebo saline normal saline to the other group and and the important point uh well both groups were very well balanced they were really advanced age patients 77 years um actually they enrolled only patients over 65 years so this is sort of high-risk patients early in the disease and and uh with many comorbidities obviously and what they found was close to a 50 decrease in the development of severe respiratory disease there were 16 percent in the convalescent plasma 31 in the placebo so a 50 decrease in the progression of disease which is uh i would say similar to what we have seen with monoclonal antibodies which have been in the range of 50 to 70 percent with the regeneron and so this is this is something important for for like developing countries that cannot afford the monoclonal you can use this uh convalescent plasma really early in the first three days especially plasma with high titers of neutralizing antibodies and you can see that obviously the placebo and the convalescent plasma separate really early and and it prevents uh clinical deterioration so i thought it was important uh if not so much for the united states because we have the monoclonals but for many other countries that cannot afford um the the monoclonal antibodies i can use instead uh plasma from convalescent patients so that that's it i'm gonna stop sharing and go to the main screen thank you thank you thank you dr sosa so much another great uh presentation and i wanted to remind everybody um so many of you have already started putting in your questions and please don't hesitate as you think of some questions to put in the chat please feel free and i'm going to turn it over now to dr leslie hayes who's our um primary care physician and addiction medicine physician from el centro hi and i'm just going to be finishing up the talk that i've been doing um and on things that people have learned from cobit that they're going to use after covid and um sorry let me get to okay so one thing a lot of people talk that they'd really learned from kobit was of the value of family and these are my husband's family and my family and one of my favorite comments somebody said i married well doing things as a family keeps reminding me of why i fell in love in the first place and any arguments remind me that what we have is worth fighting for i could stay home forever with my family people talk about um ways to get their kids active and outside despite being stuck at home and everybody out walking and several people commented that they are much happier now that their kids have far fewer after-school activities and one last comment that i really liked was we should be with people that we would like to be around even if we are stuck in a house with them for over a year which i thought was kind of sweet and then people talked a lot about the system changes we should make for medicine and i think definitely some of these are worth thinking about paid sick leave in a law against retribution for employees calling out need to be part of our society and then a lot of people talked about the need for a health care system not this crazy patchwork quilt where every office healthcare system lab public health department has to make its own decisions and plans about absolutely everything and how poor the communication is between many different parts of our health system the entire industry of medicine needs a complete overall overhaul staffing reimbursement under served care a few people comment on we need a nationwide medical license rather than being saddled with state requirements if a provider from state a can practice in state b during a pandemic do they suddenly become incompetent when the emergency passes this one i thought was really important if the collective we as a society choose to truly tackle a problem together we can succeed and i've been talking about the coveted vaccine and how we just had to throw time money and effort at it and bang we came up with this amazing vaccine and i'd love to think for me i know my personal area of interest is the um opioid epidemic and i would love to have us put that kind of effort into that and see if we could make a real difference in that and so but any of many issues poverty social justice climate change if we really focus time effort and money on i'd like to think we could make a difference in these do them one at a time and this isn't something i think about because i'm not involved with residency but people were talking about how um the not having to do in-person residency interviews has made it a lot easier for people who are poor to be able to do more different residency interviews and so overhauling the system after we're done and then us needs to rethink child care the over-reliance on school is a child care option school should not be um child care it's a place for learning but school closure should not mean that working parents have as much of a crisis as they've had this year and then some insights on the workplace and this is my organization's leadership and good leadership makes a big difference at every level if you would not go into battle with your co-workers you may not be working in the right place and the people who help you survive this trauma are truly your tribe and all vaccines should be given to children strapped in car seats i love this one it really has been much easier drive through fluke clinics it was amazing how very efficient these were and i really liked not having to meet with drug reps way more of my patients are hard of hearing than i ever realized i'll be rethinking how often and how many labs are really needed have been doing a lot less during this time and finding out for the most part it works out i have been amazed to find how little of the stuff i do in person i actually 100 need and then there's some stuff where it's like okay definitely when we go back i am looking forward to being able to do some of this regularly again without nurses and families bringing baked goods it's a whole lot easier to avoid eating impulsively and less office and drama and gossip with people working remotely and then just some random comments many more people than i realized have been coloring their hair virtual piano lessons are great don't spend the holidays never leave something for tomorrow that could be done today you don't know what tomorrow may bring this one i definitely identified with i now understand why patients under chronic stress think they have developed adhd i think i started every conversation in march and april with wait did i tell you this already the days of kids missing school for a mild sick day or snow day should be gone virtual infrastructure for schooling should remain in place screens really do fry your children's brain we really do eat out too much six degrees of separation is actually closer to three degrees or less so many cobit patients are connected to each other or intertwined in their daily life keep parent teacher conferences virtual forever i learned how much superfluous travel i was doing pre-govid this brought about writing a list and checking it twice before heading out on a shopping trip and another one of my favorites maybe men will continue to not tell women to smile even once we aren't all wearing masks so and i just wanted to real quick share one other thing if i could hear this showing up on the screen this is from dr spencer no it's not we're just saying it's not okay hang on just a second let me go back to the screen share i'm gonna stop and reshare real quick so is that one showing up the vaccine all right regardless i'm gonna leave and let go to questions thank you thank you dr hayes uh so much i always look forward to your powerpoint slides i wanted to turn it over now to uh marla sivers from the department of health marla i think you're you're um your volume's a little low oh what's happening last time is it better now yes okay great uh moving my computer around to different networks and platforms is wreaking havoc with my audio settings i apologize um i just briefly wanted to um share the news in case people hadn't heard it that new mexico has moved to its next phase of vaccine rollout which is phase 1b there's a bunch of new information up on our website about the rollout of vaccines and the phasing so if you haven't looked at that since friday or saturday go back and take a second look because there's a lot more detail about the phases and more detail will be shared um today in a press conference that our secretary of health dr tracy collins will be doing this afternoon at three o'clock the demand for vaccine in phase 1b exceeds the availability of vaccine currently so even though we've moved to phase 1b which includes a big group of people there will still be prioritization and phasing within phase 1b so sequentially we'll be starting with people 75 years of age or older people 16 years of age or older with at least one chronic medical condition and that's defined in the in the document frontline essential workers also as defined in the document and then vulnerable populations so as we start phase one b we'll be focusing on people over age 75 first so these will be people who are not residing in nursing homes or licensed assisted living facilities those people were included in phase 1a and i hope there'll be some additional information about this at the press conference this afternoon but a lot of new information available so take a look at that because i think it answers a lot of the questions that people have had recently things thank you marla so much and i know you've been working probably 24 7 on on the vaccine rollout and practically since since march so we are so appreciative um again ask please up put in the chat any vaccine related questions you have i think marla is able to stay on for a little bit um lastly i'd like to introduce dr cecilia thompson who's a close colleague of dr clarissa culbreth from tricor labs cecilia do you want to just say hi i don't think you have any updates but you're available for questions is that right yes um yes and i am associate director of infectious disease diagnostics here at tricore no updates today but i'm happy to take any questions that anyone might have fantastic thank you dr thompson i'm going to turn it back over to carla now carla thornton who's gonna start with some some of your questions so thank you everybody thank you joanna um i as promised last week i'm gonna go back to last week's questions and try to finish them up so that we can make sure that we get everybody's responses um there was a question um probably i don't know for nestor probably if any is there any information at this point about the side effects and effectiveness of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine uh not really i haven't i haven't really reviewed in in detail i was waiting for them to present a complete report to the fda because all i know it's the efficacy data from the from the studies that they presented i think it was in the landsat and and the the most uh relevant issue that i remember were those cases one case of or actually two cases of uh transfer myelitis but one of them was discarded uh thought to be associated with pre-existing multiple sclerosis so that was like the only red flag that i remember um and there were some cases of facial paralysis but they were balanced in both arms i have to but i have to go back and read the efficacy data i can bring it next next week if you want excellent thank you nestor um there is a question from tina sanchez about it um you sort of mentioned this earlier in esther but is convalescent plasma still being given at unm just sort of any updates about complexity plasma that you have that in the way that we're using it or not using it oh nestor you're muted sorry yeah i have talked to dr harkin michelle harkins which is one of the uh the chief of of critical care and pulmonary here and very early i think around maybe march or april we'll stop using it i don't know if there have been like you know uh providers that are still using it individually but we are not uh transfusing plasma anymore we're just uh following essentially the nih guidelines um and and using rendestivir dexamethasone uh and and uh and enrolling patients in in the act trials that we are conducting with with with the nih but but no the short answer is i don't think we're using any convalescent plasma uh at least not on an institutional basis thank you very much um marla this i think is for you this was from fred fox was asking about the initial allotments of vaccine that they were supposed to be on a per capita basis um and he said if yet if i understand it right new mexico received 14 500 of pfizer while arizona received 172 000 it was just saying that didn't seem proportionate i don't know if you have insight into the allotment yeah i don't have much insight into that you know it's happening at the federal level and initially it was uh you know per capita and in that 14 000 that new mexico originally received there was also some additional vaccine provision that came to our state that went directly to ihs and directly to the va um so that number number's a little bit misleading because there was a bit more vaccine coming into the state for that early distribution but the weekly allotments are not only based upon your population but also your demonstrated ability to actually get vaccine into arms and so that's why that reporting back into nemsis about vaccines that have been given is so important because we update that information to hhs daily and being able to demonstrate that we don't have a lot of vaccines sitting around in refrigerators and freezers and that we're really getting it out is important to be able to receive those weekly distributions in the amounts that we're requesting from hhs thank you and one more for you um from jeffrey miller it's if somebody signed up for a vaccine and then got it someplace else like at unm would you do they what do they do do they need to do something yeah it's a good question it's come up a couple of times and i don't know right now that the online portal has any uh way to kind of take yourself off that list if you've already been vaccinated um i know they are sort of working on being able to link up that data with vaccines given to people who are in the registration system because it is a question that um has come up great thank you very much and there was a question from ann ann turner i'm not remembering exactly the contest context but it says is a daily low dose aspirin recommended i think it was just talking about the pro coagula you know the coagulopathy that goes along with covet i don't know nestor if you can speak to that yeah well i haven't seen it in the guidelines in the official guidelines of the nih and idsa although i have heard uh several experts uh specifically i remember dr daniel griffin from new york uh mentioning that he's given it to some of the patients in the in the outpatient setting like a low dose aspirin uh when they are diagnosed with koi especially if they have you know advanced age and they have a higher risk of developing this uh thrombopathy or or or pro coagulation state uh but i haven't really seen it in the official guidelines uh from either idsa or or um but i'll have to recheck and because they did actually on january 8 i think they updated the idsa guidelines so i have to look at those but not in the previous one this is leslie one other thing to consider along those lines is if you have a woman on birth control or on hormone replacement therapy i would definitely discuss whether or not they should stop um you know for the month around while they have coveted so great and again no official recommendations on that but thank you um and joanna this was actually your question from last week but does pfizer or moderna have research on results if you space out the dose more than 21 or 28 weeks anybody uh well i i can i can comment on that i mean the yeah the at least the two stories the the modern and pfeister were pretty uh strict with their with their second vaccination date but i think it's important to and and this is obviously more speculation but um you know with vaccinations um i mean you cannot give the doses too early to close like less than three weeks less than four weeks but there's probably not a significant negative effect if you have to wait a little bit longer if you space it a little bit and this is from you know from vaccination of me or using vaccines other other vaccines uh in which what you don't want to what you don't want to do is give it right away because then the effector cells that you just developed are going to inhibit the second dose but if you wait more than three or four weeks and and longer than that there should be the booster effect uh uh nevertheless so so i i think it's not um that critical to do it in the exact date obviously i wouldn't waste six months or or more and the reason why they did this close vaccination is to get these studies over with right away i mean they could have said we're going to give the first those time zero and the second one in three months but they wanted actually to vaccinate people and show the efficacy and and use the vaccine in the real world as we're doing now uh but there's really no biological concerns in delaying you know four five six weeks probably but we don't have data obviously but but from other vaccines we know that it's safe and you can see the the children vaccination schedule there i mean tetanus we get every five years uh so so it's no big deal some of the pneumococcal vaccine can be repeated after two years so it's not that they don't work it's probably that that if they weren't they were not study um with a longer interval great thank you um and leslie hayes actually asked the question is the vaccine still believed to be effective against the south african variant well we're going to have to be to stay tuned for that one because the the the the the data that i showed for the pfizer uh was with a virus with only one mutation the five zero one and now with the other there's another mutation i think it's 484 which uh i have seen experts speculate that it may change the the ability of antibodies to attach to the receptor binding domain so i think we need to wait for for specific experiments using the south african before we can generalize uh because this data from from the physical vaccine was only with a with a virus that's what was constructed in the laboratory with a single point change from the wild type to the but so so it looks like the the variant but it doesn't have the 17 mutations i think we need we need to wait to be sure about the south african thank you nestor so that's all the question we got all of the questions from last week answered so we'll move on to the um to more of the new questions joanna would you like to to start you're muted thank you carly yes um just going up to the top of our uh chat um thank you everyone for allowing us to come back to last week's questions we didn't want to forget forget your amazing questions from last week um uh dona orgarons asked um could the new strain be more transvisible but a weaker strain and i think you commented on uh you might have commented on this a little bit nestor but could you just clarify yeah according to to the information that we have from england uh it's more transmissible but not necessarily less or more pathogenic i mean they they still were seeing hospitalizations and patients going into critical care but with a similar frequency uh with the new variants and the old variants and that that's the information in which they base their conclusion that is not more lethal not less lethal than than the than the other similar in in its behavior in its pathogenicity it's just that um it's more transmissible and in fact have substituted the old variants in many of the communities where it became uh prevalent it you know in the middle of december it it was the most common and and it's remaining the most common and it's already in many other european countries austria uh italy so there are several countries that have reported um the presence and an increase in the frequency of this variant thanks nestor um leslie do you want to ask your your question about um for those of you or your patients who might have gotten coveted when the most opportune time to get the vaccine sure so um i had cova diagnosed november 11th which would make me do for the vaccine roughly february 11th but my question is if it's going to take until the second vaccine for me to have immunity i don't want to go a month not being immune and since i could get it now and be boosted up so is there any or is it just that i'm going to have you know reasonable immunity 90 days out and if i get the vaccine it will boost me up right away since i've already been exposed that's a good question and it's a complicated one because we don't have that many that much data the thought is that if because you have the infection you probably you have a 95 percent probability of being immune for a long time and now we have data out a month there was a recent paper describing you know the duration of of b cell memory memory b cells uh a month out so you're probably protected except for if you're that five percent or or less than five percent of people who are not able to produce antibodies so in general yet you're going to be protected and i think and this is something obviously we don't have data but probably your first vaccination is going to be a a booster right it's really so you should get the levels of protection and this will see when they publish the data you're probably going to get the levels of protection of a person who's getting your second dose because now you're getting your second dose of the virus really it's not you know the second dose formally but it should work like that because you you should have memory b cells waiting for that antigen to come into your system again that's why protein and they're gonna recognize us unless you belong to that five percent uh which we don't know why but there are people who do not produce any any antibodies but if you had a symptomatic um illness you're probably you're probably immune and you can do one of those rapid antigen antibody tests and check that you you do have antibodies and and and for sure this your first dose is going to be a booster for you so you'll be protected as soon as you get the first dose great thank you so much thanks nestor um just um nestor the slide you put up about the um you know the adverse events primarily the anaphylactic reactions were those primarily was that from uh the pfizer vaccine or medina or comp was that just for the pfizer use the physics right the data is from just the physical vaccine it was the initial uh initial 1.8 million people who were vaccinated right great do we have any do you know if there's a similar if we have any similar data from moderna yet or that's one of the questions from dr mcgrew right i haven't i haven't seen any i just when i reviewed the there was a review paper in the new england journal the author mentioned that that the incidence seems to be lower with the moderna lower than with the with the physical vaccine they don't know why they have the same polytylene glycol 2000 in the components the only difference are the lipids the lipids are slightly different uh the rest are just salts and things like phosphate and chloride etc so that shouldn't be the reactogenic material but the you know the most significant difference is the the the lipids that accompany the the mrna because the mrna is very very similar to and it shouldn't be you know allergenic because we have mrna everywhere so it shouldn't be uh but yeah it seems to be less but we have to wait for the results and and you know the the vaccine adverse event reporting system with the modern and now in the places that they're using to see that in fact is but i think most of the um news about allergic reaction occur with the with the physio including that reaction in the uk and the one in alaska et cetera we're all from the pfizer uh but they have been with the modern but i think it's a little bit less right right thanks nestor interestingly i've just seen samantha reports on with moderna that people who have facial injections like cosmetic facial fillers have had some kind of uh reaction um i don't know if that's a if that's a true finding or or not um uh carla blondel asks should patients take um antihistamine before receiving the visor vaccine do you think is that a recommendation uh i haven't seen that written in the recommendations um i think what i have heard from experts is that if you if you have a history of anaphylactic reactions or you have many allergies um you should probably consult your primary care and see what he tells you um you know i don't see any problems i don't think the antihistaminic will inhibit the immunogenicity of the vaccine so it's a decision it's sort of a an individual decision depending on your allergies the severity of your allergies but i don't think i have seen anything written you know in the cdc web page recommending like pre-medication or right off the bat great great um heather do you want to unmute and ask your questions about the nsaids related to the vaccines sure thanks um this is i think related to what you were just saying dr sosa is there any you know at the very beginning someone i don't even remember where i heard it said don't take advil or leave things like that after you get the vaccine to help with myalgias because you might actually interfere with the immunity that the vaccine is producing and i don't under i don't know the mechanism of that or whether that's real or not yeah i haven't i haven't really seen it and and i mean there's no way for me to tell uh i can speculate i don't think uh you know a couple of ibuprofen will damp your immune system you know completely and you're not gonna react but i haven't seen any data and i know a lot of people when they get vaccinated they pre-medicate with acetaminophen or or ibuprofen you know a couple of pills so um but i i haven't seen any any heart or solid data to that regard and i'm gonna get vaccinated today and i'm gonna take i'm gonna take another profit when i go to bed tonight as soon as i finish the echo i'm gonna go for my appointment and and so so i'll check my levels in a few weeks perfect thank you for speculating yeah um just wanted to let everybody know there's a few questions that are a little bit of repeat jessica kirk asked a question that that was answered was a question of mine from last week's and dr bowen asked a question that i think is similar to leslie hayes so i think we'll pass on those right now um there's a question about if there's some drive-through vaccine sites um a lean alien gush kind of rightly uh worries about people driving off and then having reactions that's a really good point marla do you want to comment on that has that been thought out through probably i'm sure you your office has thought that through you know i know that some other states are doing um drive-through vaccine sites for cobit vaccination you know i kind of worry about the same thing um you know how well can you monitor a person if you've got you know a dozen people or so sitting in their car um i think just the logistics of that might be difficult um and then making sure that people remain for the full 15 or you know 30 minutes depending on what the recommendation is for them and that people you know don't just say like i feel fine and drive off i mean we know that happens with allergy shots now right people are supposed to hang around for 15 minutes but people are always anxious to get out the door and go so i think logistically that could be a bit of a challenge and i think just sort of making sure your drive-through clinic is really planned out and that you've kind of screened out those higher risk people from the drive up and had them maybe go to a you know an indoor site where they can be more closely monitored you know those are just sort of those operational details that as we get more into it um i think we'll have to be thought through to make sure we're doing it safely great uh thank you marla um uh pamela um asks about monocle antibody infusion and uh and also kind of comparing it to convalescent plasma and i we talked about convalescent plasma but i'm wondering nestor if you might be able to talk about um there was an article in the albuquerque journal talking about monocle antibodies kind of maybe being underutilized in in new mexico and wondered if you might be able to kind of talk about that um pamela asked why why are they relegated to outpatient treatment and high-risk patients um yeah that's that's a good question i mean i don't know the reasons why they have been uh under use i think it's it's probably related to the to the fact that you get tested in one place and the infusion is in another place and and there's got to be some sort of thinking when a person requests a test and then there are one or two days for the results and that person requires like an evaluation of risks and somebody a provider have to make a decision and refer so i think all those pieces are not in a single you know unified way the way we are doing here at unm is when you get the test at the we call the annex the area next to the emergency room um if you are if you have some of the some of the uh risk factors you are you complete a form and if if you agreed for the injection and you have the risk factors they call you when you are positive and they at least offer you the the possibility of going to the infusion center that we have uh but there are other places that have done it better i mean like the mayo clinic already is uh revealing their experience with the first a thousand patients over a thousand patients and also houston methodist i saw in the news not even in scientific papers but they also um commented on their experience with the first thousand patients so at least those two institutions have two thousand which is much more that we have in the in the publications in the new england journal with the george general and and eli lilly and and the good thing is that they found no significant adverse event which is reassuring in over 2000 patients uh and no and and they also were reporting uh decrease in the hospitalizations to the level similar to what was seen in the literature 60 70 percent in those high risk once they receive you can prevent the hospitalization so so they're going to publish that that information in a combined way mayo clinic and methodist hospital in houston so hopefully we'll have that free publication in the next few weeks but it's looking good so i think it's it's a matter of spreading the boys thinking about it actually thinking that if you have a 65 year old or a 55 with comorbidities and they test positive you you have to at least try to offer that that treatment because it does decrease 70 percent i mean that's a lot 70 percent hospitalizations uh uh and and also obviously progression of of disease um and the thing the same thing with with convalescent plasma i mean if you think about it you have to use it rapidly the only thing is that everything have to be quick you have to do the test get the result and give the patient before it's a week or a week and a half so that's that's the important thing you you cannot wait 10 days to to decide who you're going to give the the medication because then it's probably ineffective thank you so much nestor back to you carla thank you joanna there are a lot of questions coming in again a lot of interest about vaccines so we may have to hold off on some of these till next week again um elena benjamin asked she's heard anecdotally that people who have had kobet are getting more severe side effects with the vaccine is there any evidence or any reports that you've seen about that yeah i i haven't i haven't i mean i heard the same thing uh actually it was in an echo this morning and was the same comment um i think in one of the stories i don't remember it was modern or pfizer they actually reported their the experience of the vaccines with the people who had copied and there was no more adverse event in the trial i don't know why people in the in lao that we're using it in real life are reporting that but there was no uh an increase adverse event which that's that was something that that not so much for the reactor genicity but people were worried about more severe disease after vaccination something you know the the the antibiotic facilitated disease that we see with dengue and some other infections and that was not observed in the trials in the clinical trials but but i don't know i don't know i i heard the same thing that people are having more more of a severe reaction i guess you know if if you uh if you compare the the experience with the second dose the second dose is more reactorgenic than the first what i was telling leslie so for her if you had copy before your first dose is going to be like a second though so it's expected to have more adverse events it's almost like getting a second dose already if you have copied before so it's possible but i i you know it was not observed to us to a large degree in the in the trials thank you i just wanted to let everybody know about 12 45 the link to the cme went into the chat so please we would love to hear your feedback and if you would like to see me please fill that out um i'll just keep moving forward with the questions marlo i think this is really for you do you have any clarity on where residents and congregate care shelters fall into the categories 1a or 1b yeah so um they fall into one b um and pretty far down on the prioritization list like i said in phase one b um people are further sort of segregated into priority so first priority being people 75 years of age or older and then the fourth priority in that group being what's being called vulnerable populations so that would include people who are living in congregate settings like shelters uh correctional facilities but so they are in phase 1b um but later in phase 1b based upon upon the current priority and i'm also going to share a link in the chat um to a cdc site that has a lot of answers to the questions that i'm seeing in the chat about vaccine in terms of timing of doses and what if you already had it and if you have a bad reaction to the first vaccine should you get the second i know we're short on time so i'll just put that in the chat because i think it will help answer a lot of the questions i see coming in excellent thank you and one new mexico specific question about when when a person gets vaccinated through the doh website uh do they do they sign up for their second vaccination at that time i've had some people tell me that they couldn't actually get a second they couldn't get an appointment for a follow-up vaccine can you speak to that marla yeah i think it's been very uh location specific so some locations have been able to go ahead and schedule that second vaccine for folks and other places have not so unfortunately it's not standardized i think it depends where you've received the vaccine what i'm told is that people who receive the initial dose though will be tracked and receive a reminder through the website when it's time for their second dose given an opportunity to make an appointment you know the same way they got their first appointment if they don't already have one thank you very much um dr yehuda pat asked since president-elect biden plans to release the entire stocka vaccine for first dose administration what what is planned anybody speculate about that marla i don't know if you i mean if you guys is there that's a discussion just about an incredible ramp up of vaccination plans yeah and i think you know having the vaccine shipped is you know only one piece of the puzzle there has to be capacity um you know in the states to be able to roll the vaccine out um more quickly so i think just having it arrive um and be on site is only you know one piece of the puzzle and obviously you know we struggle with our healthcare capacity especially in rural and underserved areas you know just like we do for all of our other health care needs so you know i think that will be a challenge that you know we have to continue to sort of struggle to meet and we'll really need to think outside the box how we can do this more efficiently and much quicker you very much um let's see yeah there are a lot of questions about just the logistics of getting a vaccine so i'm glad that you're going to put that into the chat um let's see um amy weiss asked with severe abdominal cramps a few hours after receiving a vaccine be a contraindication to getting the second vaccine i don't know if anyone can speak to that and currently go ahead doctor says go ahead no no go ahead go ahead i was just going to say currently really the only contraindication to receiving your second vaccine is if you have a severe allergic reaction to the first dose esther did you have any other comments great so um again a lot of speculation but danette brown asked do you have any idea what hospitalization is going down what will when people will start to allow surgeries that are medically necessary um i don't have any insights specifically about that um but my thought is that as most of our counties are still in this red um you know red zone we won't see changes to that until we have more people moving into back to yellow and green thank you i don't know nestor if you have any if you have any thoughts about that from a unmh standpoint or if you've heard anything no i haven't i really have excellent thank you um there's a comment in here um from loretta conder about what's happening in her county i don't know if loretta if you just want to unmute yourself and maybe we can um next week have people put into the chat what's happening in their own in their own areas loretta are you on can you unmute yourself it doesn't look like that i don't know joanna did you see any other sort of um last-minute questions that that we can ask before we disconnect i think there's a question maybe from marla from don chavez uh about if um how how people might be able to volunteer to help um at vaccination sites maybe um is there is there is there a way that people you know you know perhaps uh lay public or even medical providers might be able to help with some of the coordination or on-site is there any avenue to do that marla the uh the avenue to do that that i'm aware of is really signing up with medical reserve corps the vaccine distribution points are being managed by my colleagues in public health division um and not here in erd so i don't have any more specific information about that very helpful so the medical reserve corps would be the place great well we just have a couple of minutes left um we'll just make a couple of announcements and like i said there we'll make sure we got all of the questions a lot of them are overlapping about um about timing of doses and things like that but we'll go through everything that hasn't been directly answered and make sure that we if we'll get it next time if we um if we did miss it um i just wanted to remind everybody again to please fill out the cme and give us feedback if you if you if you can and we have several other echoes going on for covid19 um we have a critical care echo that will be not this week but the following week this is run by dr michelle harkins and um joanna do you want to talk about the resiliency echo sure sure so there's a first responder resiliency echo that's every monday it's happening today with the topic uh resiliency in the time of the pandemic um that's two to three every monday and then this thursday from 12 to one and every other thursday there's a mental health and resiliency echo alternating with the substance use and chronic pain echo related to the pandemic and then beginning in february and february 17th you'll get more information soon we're going to be starting an eight-week series on climate change in human health much of it is related to ideologies of the pandemic as well that's that's all i have carla great thank you so thank you everyone for joining um we really appreciate it and we will see you next week you,,1/11/2021
34,good afternoon everyone welcome to the coven 19 office out infectious diseases office hours are really happy to see everybody hope everyone is having a good week so far um just a couple of announcements and we'll introduce our hub team i just wanted to let everybody know that um we would love to see your faces so if you have a camera we would ask that you turn it on if you can we understand that some people can't but we would love to see your faces and we would also ask that you if you have a question during the session that you put your um your question into the chat box and we'll be monitoring that and we'll try to get to all the questions that we possibly can today uh also please refrain unless you're one of the hub team members please refrain from answering those questions in the chat unless you're called on by one of the one of the hub team members and just as a reminder you'll uh our digital librarian will be putting information into the chat box about a lot of things that we're discussing so please keep an eye on that as well so again we have a really exciting uh session today we actually have a case one of our colleagues dan smith is going to present a case after we do our brief update so we're excited he spontaneously sent us this case and it's very interesting and he thought it would be really helpful for all of all of you to see it so we'll talk about that shortly so i'm going to start with some introductions my name is carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician at unm and one of the senior associate directors here at project echo and i want to introduce my colleague joanna katzman joanna you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody uh welcome um joanna kessman here i'm a neurologist at project echo and also work at unm hospital thank you thanks sharon and joanna and i will be co-facilitating the session and i'm going to turn it over to dr nester sosa he can introduce himself and and do his presentation and then we'll go to the rest of the hub team thank you nestor thank you hi i'm nestor sosa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at the university of new mexico let me share my screen put it in full screen okay can you see my screen okay can you hear me well good okay so today because we have a case i'm going to be really brief i i'm more than like going into a lot of details on on papers published paper i really want to share um some really uh news i mean striking news that have been uh communicated recently about many things related to kobe uh and then go i'm gonna show you some of the data on these news but i'll first have to want to give you the sort of the headline uh first of all there was a a pre-publication uh comment from the siren study in the uk which is a study about healthcare workers that have been um they have been positive and for covid and apparently having kobe give you an 83 percent protection but i'll show you a slide on that protection from reinfection for five months so it's interesting uh there's a lot of news about the new uh variant and and in fact uh one of the latest news is that it is on it's not only more transmissible but there's some evidence of of more severity and i'll show you some of the some of the studies that the that the british have provided uh to support that that assertion that that actually is not only more transmissible or more severe um interestingly enough the the variant from south africa seems to be less susceptible to antibodies from convalescent patients and probably also from vaccines including the modern vaccine some news on the on the therapeutics front we are so excited about the vaccine that we have forgotten about some of the therapeutics but uh there was a a communication on the results of a study from the montreal heart institute about colchicine helping for kobit i'll show you that um also something about hybrid methane hybrid methane as you know it's been uh um there were some excitement at the beginning showing that it was active but we we haven't really heard anything but now the nih sort of opened the door and i'm going to show you what the nih says about about um hybrimectin now there was a communication on a preliminary result on the monoclonal antibodies in nursing homes uh and finally the cdc and nwa show have increased the the recommendation for uh interval between the first and the second dose all the way up to 42 days so i'm going to show you some data on those news first the siren story as i said this is a this is a study done in the uk essentially with healthcare worker medical staff they enroll page uh subjects from june 18 to november uh nine twenty thousand over twenty uh participants 84 were females and there were some in that cohort that were positive people who had had kobe before and 14 which were not infected and they actually followed them uh for for four months for five months and they found 44 reinfections in that cohort uh of those positives and 409 so more infections in the in the negative cohort as you might expect people who have never had coffee and when they calculated the the the ultra ratio for infection was 0.17 meaning 83 percent protection from reinfection at least within the first five months of infection so that and that's one of the data points that actually the cec is using to recommend that people who who have coveted can easily wait three months for the vaccine there's no hurry because they probably have an 83 percent protection from from reinfection the second um data was somewhat more worrisome and it was a communication by the by the authorities also in the in the uk by public health england that apparently the variant that they're seeing the the 117 variant uh it's also more severe or more lethal and there have been um several uh studies uh rapid stories they have been being published by the london school of of uh hygiene and tropical medicine by the imperial college of london by the university of exeter and all of them have shown an increase in the ultra ratio of having a more severe disease in the vicinity of of 30 30 to 40 1.35 uh here 1.29 this was the exeter was a little bit higher one 1.91 but if you average all of these um they found a uh you know a 30 more severe clinical course uh and this is a complete change from the initial report in the initial report if you remember and i said it in the in this uh uh echo that that there was only evidence of more transmissibility but no more severity unfortunately now they're gathering data now that they have more people hospitalized apparently these patients are doing poorly uh or poorer than than those with the old variants the other the other worrisome issue is the the escape uh from neutralization so this this variant specifically the the south african variant more than the more than the uk variant this one the south african is called the 501y b2 variant uh they did an experiment with with uh serum from people who had had the disease in the first wave and they they actually saw that there was no neutralization and and this is a plate neutralization study in which these you know black dots are actually colonies of the virus destroying the cells in the in the in the in the in the culture so uh if if you have neutralization like like the the the lower dilutions are going to basically prevent this plague from forming but you can see that especially this variant uh the hv001 which is sort of a modified south african variant there was growth of the virus all over i mean it doesn't matter it was basically not neutralized by the antibodies from a person who had the disease in the first wave meaning that that it's possible to be reinfected with this new variant based on the story and then the other question is do the vaccines work uh there was a first study that i think i shared with you last week in which that first study only evaluated the one mutation and there was no effect the vaccine seems to be uh seems to neutralize the old variants and the new variants but now unfortunately new data it's been accumu accumulated and when you combine all of the mutation that for instance the brazilian and the south african uh strain have there is a decrease and you can see how these lines go like downward meaning that there's less neutralization with the with the with the variant that has all the mutation compared to the wild type so there is there is uh some escape from neutralization even uh from this serum from vaccinated patients so that highlights the importance of of you know rapidly vaccinating people and getting the epidemic on the control before we are inundated with these new variants because they may not be as i mean the vaccines may not be as effective and in fact today i saw in the news right before i i came into the hospital that moderna was actually uh developing a vaccine for one of these variants so it's already been considered by some of the manufacturer uh on the therapeutic front i told you that there's a the the group from the montreal heart institute actually give a press release this is not a paper a press release on their study called the call corona study which was basically evaluating colchicine in patients who were early in the disease more than 40 years of age with one risk factors non-hospitalized and they were given essentially colchicine for a month cochising as you know has been is used for gout and other inflammatory diseases so it's an anti-inflammatory with a different mechanism of action to steroids or or or non-steroidals but but it's definitely an anti-inflammatory drug and and it decreased according to this uh this press release again it's not a publication 25 percent decrease in hospitalization 50 decrease in the progression to mechanical ventilation and 44 decrease in in death so so apparently apparently very uh very interesting result with this call chasing study and they have been a previous study um with colchicine in kobe which also shows some clinical benefits so it's not the first result and in fact this study was published in june i had already forgotten about it it was police june 24 in jama um it was intended for cardiac patient but they found this overall um improving in survival uh from from the primary clinical endpoint so interesting so we have probably another anti-inflammatory drug coming on board and and hopefully will be incorporated once the corona still is published the corona was a large study over 5000 patients enrolled or close to 5000 patients and roll so so it is a significant finding but we have to see the publication to to get the details um the other uh uh topic that i that i told you about was the change in the guidelines on january 14 the nih actually changed its language about ivory methane and now they said that um that currently there are insufficient data to recommend for or against before it wasn't even considered as a therapeutic and i think it's based on some of the studies that have been published especially from from the middle east egypt and bangladesh and there are also studies um from other countries we which is starting to show some efficacy and in fact there was a a pilot story from spain over the weekend also mentioning some benefit with albert mexic so i think we need to to stay tuned hopefully we'll we'll see the results of a large trial in the next few weeks and and we'll have more evidence for or against cyber methane in kobe as early treatment or prevention uh finally there was this communication by eli lilly of his uh bam bam bam la nimi mad um monoclonal use in nursing home residents and staff so they gave it to they administered uh four thousand two hundred milligrams versus placebo to the to 965 nursing home residents or staff and they followed them to see they developed kobe and there was a 57 according to this press release 57 decrease in the risk of developing symptomatic coping with this intervention and it was as high as 84 80 if you analyze only the nursing home dressy and the the older and vulnerable population in this nursing home so we have to see the the publication but it's another interesting uh use for these for this drug as a bridge for for vaccination uh and finally the last uh point was that now uh because of the you know the need for more vaccines and the idea of increasing uh the the coverage of the first vaccine uh both the cdc and and the nwa show now allow or or are willing to accept that you can space the second dose up to 42 days if it's uh if you have like a you know a difficult situation or churches or vaccine you can you can try to vaccinate more people with the first dose and get the second dose a little bit later but definitely not later than six weeks um according to these two uh uh bodies i think that that's it i'm gonna stop sharing and we can go to the next session thank you thank you thank you for that excellent update nestor i'm going to go ahead and turn to leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself and and thank you for presenting hi leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine in espanola and i'm just going to do a quick primary care update and first is some good news which is influenza cases are really low this year this is from the cdc u.s influenza surveillance report from january 16th and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza is 0.1 i'm couldn't find what the number normally is but i got to believe it's at least 20 to 30 at least based on my own clinical experience and the number of influenza positives reported by public health labs remains much lower than normal despite the fact we're doing a normal number of tests and if you look here um there's multiple different graphs for different flu season years and this is 2020 to 2021 and you could really obvious we're having a much less flu this year than normal and this is the weekly surveillance report and anything in the green is low or minimal and you can see the entire country pretty much has minimal flu this year so definitely um one small silver lining to the covet epidemic is that flu is much lower than usual and then um i thought this was a nice article from medscape internal medicine just five reasons to continue to wear a mask after you're vaccinated i certainly hear people asking about this all the time well once i get the vaccine can i you know stop wearing a mask and go hang out with my friends the answer is no please don't do this um five reasons one the first is no vaccine is 100 effective second is vaccines don't provide immediate protection i had a patient come in this morning who was not actually eligible for the vaccine and was somehow convinced he just needed to make an appointment and get it but he looked at me and he's disappointed he said oh shoot well i was going to go to santa fe and hang out with my daughter after i got the vaccine today figuring i'd be okay and it's like no even if you'd gotten the vaccine that was not going to be safe the third is coveted vaccines may not prevent you from spreading the virus we still don't have a definitive answer on this one the fourth is masks protect people with compromised immune systems so there are people who are not going to develop a good response to the vaccine and we're going to protect them wearing the masks and the fifth as uh dr sosa was just talking about we the new strains are kind of scary and may not be covered by the vaccine and so the masks are going to protect you against any strain of covet even if we get the genetic mutations and then last is an article and this is a pre-print article and not only is it a pre-print with the caveats that it hasn't been peer reviewed but i could not find what journal it was going to be published in so a couple caveats on this article but it still it was quite interesting and i wanted to present it and i will mention that the new york post article that clued me into this started off by saying one in eight patients with cova die in the next six months and they did not specify that it was hospitalized patients and i felt my heart skip about three beats but it was one in eight hospitalized patients who go home actually die in the next six months um which i thought was pretty um important actually it's five months so they did a case control study of 47 780 individuals mean age of 55 years 55 percent were men um who were in the hospital with covet 19 and discharged alive by august 31st and they matched them to controls for democratic and clinical characteristics and mean follow-up time was 140 days for covet cases and 153 days for controls and during that time they had 766 readmissions and 320 deaths and these numbers are three and a half times and seven and a half times greater than in controls and thirty percent almost were readmitted and twelve percent died after discharge so that's really high so um i think the important take home to get from this is these are not patients we just want to send on their way and you know say follow up with me in a year we need to be checking in with these patients you know see how they're doing treat any complications they may get they also found that the rates of respiratory diabetes and cardiovascular events were significantly elevated with covid19 770 cases of respiratory cases 127 of diabetes and 126 for cardiovascular events the relative rates were higher if you were less than 70 and also higher unfortunately in ethnic minority groups respiratory disease was diagnosed in 14 000 patients after discharge 6000 of these patients had new respiratory diseases out of roughly 40 thousand um so the um resulting event rate was 770 um and 539 per 1000 person years um and this was six times the control group and um 27 times the control group for new onset so six times the control group for pre-existing respiratory disease 27 times more likely to develop respiratory disease if you're hospitalized for coping than if you do not have covet at all in addition post-discharge diagnosis of diabetes and i don't know if anybody else knows what mace means i had to look it up major adverse cardiac events chronic kidney disease and chronic liver disease so five percent of patients after covert had new onset diabetes five percent had major adverse cardiac events one and a half percent diagnosed with kidney disease and 0.3 developed liver disease so these are quite high and so again maybe think about drawing blood work on these patients check for symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain and follow them up regularly so that we don't miss these because many of these things are treatable but if they're going to progress these patients are really at very high risk and this is for all events and then new events is really what you want to look at and just see how much higher the rates of diabetes major adverse cardiac events kidney disease and chronic liver disease are in covet cases who were hospitalized than in controls who did not have covet so for further reading from the atlantic in december the virus is showing black people what they knew all along which is basically um much higher morbidity immortality and melinda moyer if you're offered a vaccine take it there have been many people who have turned down the vaccine because oh you know somebody over 70 needs it more than me or my coworkers are higher risk my wonderful brother-in-law who's a nursing student did that and i actually sent him this article but it's about why just go ahead and take the vaccine if you're offered it you know don't put it off thinking someone else needs it more than you do um this article by david leonhart underselling the vaccine um is really very worthwhile and what they're saying is basically you know things like talking about why we need masks often tend to make it seem like the vaccine isn't going to work we really need to let people know this vaccine is awesome it's got a really amazing rate of efficacy very few long-term effects that we know of this is a good vaccine and people really need to know this because i think a lot of the reason that people are not getting it is they just don't realize quite how good it is because we haven't wanted to have people stop wearing masks and stop social distancing but we do need to let them know it's a good vaccine and then just for fun um this article from san francisco gate i tested the dumbest ppe of all time the rich guy covett helmet it's basically looks like an astronaut helmet and this guy bought it for this piece that he wrote and it's really kind of amusing just reading about him wearing it and if you have an extra 300 bucks i guess you could go out and buy one and and uh do your shopping risk with a much lower risk and then last we have a new name for the covid vaccine nobody's allowed to call it the covered vaccine anymore it will now from here going forward be the fouchy ouchy so and that is all i have thank you very much leslie that was great um let's go ahead and i i know marla you don't have an update a specific update but can you go ahead and just introduce yourself sure hi everyone marla sivers infectious disease epidemiologist with new mexico department of health thank you so much um and we don't have anybody on here from tricor today so i'm going to go ahead and actually turn it over to joanna so we can get started with our case great thank you so much carla and thank you so much for our speakers the great talks is always from dr sosa and dr hayes um i'd like to introduce dr daniel smith who's the director of pharmacy at the new mexico behavioral health institute dr uh smith has a very very interesting vaccine-related case that he's going to kind of tell you about the reason for why he wanted to present the case to us and he's got some slides actually to share um as well and then after he makes his brief case presentation i'm going to open it up uh to our hub team and all of you to ask dr smith some clarifying questions um when that time comes please put your questions into the chat and we will monitor the chat and we will ask dr smith those questions and then we'll create um you know differential diagnosis just what we do with our echo cases so dr smith it's it's all you hey thank you so much what a pleasure to be on here i'm uh gonna share my screen i hope and uh show you some slides uh let's see what i got here there it is bear with me a moment okay does everything look okay can you hear me we we can hear you okay good okay um so my name is dan smith i'm the director of pharmacy here at the new mexico behavioral health institute and uh my expertise is in the area of psychopharmacology and uh a couple years ago we got involved with echo with the anti-microbial stewardship echo related to our joint commission requirements and kind of became addicts for echo stuff and uh ever since kobe came out we've been addicts for uh coveted 19 echoes of this echo and the critical care echo and just wanted to say thank you thank you thank you so much for all the work you guys have been doing because uh out here in the boonies this is just unbelievable resource for us and has been so so helpful so thank you so much so our question um briefly is uh we have an 85 year old woman who got the first dose of the modern vaccine and our question is is is the second dose contraindicated in her case and so very very briefly she's an 85 year old hispanic female she has a history of allergies to sulfa drugs she gets a rash she's had hydroxychloroquine way in the past and not related to covid and she had skin sloughing she's a lifelong smoker with a copd and mild chf and hypertension does not take anticoagulants and she got her first dose of the modernity vaccine on january 8th and the next day this is what she got she got a little bruise and she had a little bit of erythema around the injection site that resolved pretty promptly she got some cetirizine and a little topical hydrocortisone and it was gone and then the interesting reaction happened on day eight after the after the vaccine she got this large large arithmetist region developed on her uh injection site arm and uh uh was hot to the touch and uh was treated with diphenhydramine tylenol and triumph cinnalone and went away on its own in four or five days um so that's the the striking reaction that we got pretty impressive looking we think and uh so our big question is does she qualify for the second dose or does she not qualify for the second dose so we look at the cdc guidelines and i guess the the one thing i should tell you is that her primary care physician recommended that she not get the second dose when we read the cdc guidelines and several other people we've pulled when we read them primarily it seems to us that the cdc guidelines recommend that you don't get the second dose number one if you have a history of a severe allergic reaction and really what they're talking about it seems to be is anaphylaxis so sure she had a severe skin reaction but it wasn't anaphylaxis the other two ways way you might be contraindicated to the second dose is if you had an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose an immediate usually meaning a skin reaction and uh um something that happened within the first four hours after the after the dose um so our question again is does this person qualify for uh the second dose and uh can she be vaccinated if we observe it closely and if we pre-medicate her and since i wrote these slides i made one more slide and because we found this bit on pre-medication from the cdc and cdc says um not to use antihistamines as a pre-med before the covid vaccine and the reason being is that the antihistamine might um sort of block or cover up some of the evidence of anaphylaxis and delay the cutaneous symptoms so for what it's worth so at the moment we're thinking if it's okay to give her a second dose um maybe we give her some tylenol beforehand and then just observe her but that's our big question we would like to be curious to see what uh your your thoughts are on this thanks so much excellent uh dr smith excellent uh case excellent presentation thank you so much um i'm wondering uh now we'd like to you know see if anybody wants to ask you any kind of clarifying questions um i saw one from wendy johnson that she's had experience um uh with some patients similar to this um does anybody um i'm wondering if we can unmute you uh wendy would that be okay if we can unmute you sure i'll even put on my video for the for the occasion great um i was eating lunch so i don't know if anyone wants to see that so but now i'm done um no i just seen that like a very big red itchy arm people who didn't really have much of a reaction but then like seven or eight days out after vaccination like logically i'm sort of i'm i'm saying okay well maybe that's because the mrna has had time to translate into the spike protein and maybe that's you know creating that reaction locally i don't know that's how i and maybe that's creating a little bit of an inflammatory you know possibly allergic almost reaction but it's that much out because that takes that much time um but it's weird but it's happened more than a few times um and when do you what you were marked on is that um as far as you know they've uh these patients have all had second doses that have done just fine yeah they were it was moderna then it was employees at la familia and we just gave our second doses last week and we had i mean i i'm kind of surprised how we kept the clinic open last week because people were pretty under the weather and dragging while they were working uh but uh but we got through and as far as i know nobody had a similar reaction locally that local reaction of the people who had it the first time they didn't report to me this time great thank you thank you wendy so so much um wanted to uh see if trevor hawkins could unmute yeah hi i just wonder if there are any systemic symptoms in addition to the local cutaneous reaction dan do you want to answer that no she didn't have any systemic uh reactions of any kind really she was just fine quite frankly in good spirits uh after she received the dose and in her usual life dan this is joanna did she have any erythema or any rush besides the the arm any anywhere else in her body she had no no rash of any kind across her body or erythema except for in those pictures that i showed right gotcha dr caro are you available to unmute and ask your question concern for what was used to prep the skin or was she did she apply anything to the skin that could have been um uh introduced uh along with the uh the injection again and what was this a moderna uh i didn't catch that before it was modern or a pfizer first uh vaccine that was the modernity vaccine and at the clinics that she got that at the the standard treatment was to wipe the skin with a little bit of alcohol and then give the injection so i'm not aware if she put some particular lotion on her shoulder beforehand or anything like that but i don't think there was any unusual you know prescription drugs that she may have put on or unusual natural products that she may have used thanks dr caro um linda gorgos would you like to unmute sure so i was trying to get a sense of whether this was a two-phase reaction because it looked like after her initial injection she did get erythema she got diagon hydramine and topical steroids which kind of resolved things and then she reproduced at day seven or eight so i'm wondering if this was really a two-phase reaction or if her initial reaction was just tamped down by the initial treatment that gets stopped and then she really kind of flared i i surely don't know but that question is it kind of occurred to us in the background as well linda um what are you um it seems like you're on to something what are you what what are you suggesting i mean i was just thinking about some people who have these delayed th1 responses to things and the other day seven to eight was some kind of delayed th one response or if this was really all part of what was just a really marked local reaction that initially got treated calmed down and then you know kind of flared up as treatment was was stopped thinking she was better right great great thought linda and and stacy oldenburg has had a similar um situation with a patient stacy are you able to unmute yes i am um i have a a cna who was vaccinated on the 15th had no initial reaction at all no redness in her arm and over the weekend here she developed a very large like 50 cent piece sized red in duration it was hot um itchy she's had shortness of breath and lightheadedness also i did have her go see her general practitioner today he feels it is a vaccine reaction i don't know if he advised her against getting the second dose i'll have to talk to her and find out i don't believe he did great right um thank you all for asking such great questions um i wanted to maybe see um kind of ask our hub team uh dr sosa dr thornton dr hayes um marla what what your thoughts are if you have any clarifying questions for dr smith or and or what your your thoughts are yeah i have a question joanna uh dr smith it's was what was the subjective feeling was it more itching or pain with the with the a day um erythema was it associated with pain or itching or both what was the more dominant symptom she was definitely hot to the touch and she complained of itching um and she uh she's kind of sensitive in general so she you know just having fabric touching her arm was irritating to her um it would be sore if you bumped into it so i would say she had all of those symptoms quite frankly dr thornton or dr hayes do you have any questions for dr smith no thanks john i don't have any for dr smith i just i'm curious um from marla if you're if you guys are hearing about reactions like this um if you've heard anything about things like this i happening heard of this uh specific reaction um my one question for dan was did you guys report um this scenario in theirs because i think you know that's the way we're gonna learn if this type of reaction is more common than we thought during the clinical trials or if there are particular age groups or people with certain underlying conditions that seem to have this reaction so just wondering dan if you reported it to theirs yeah yes we did report it to vares so i'm pleased to report that and uh i coincidentally one of my pharmacists had nearly the same reaction she did not have it as kind of striking it wasn't nearly as severe but she had the same reaction hers was on day nine all of a sudden this rash appeared out of the blue and she mentioned that a friend of hers in texas had the same thing also so it's definitely out there my case i reported my pharmacist reported her own case the one in texas i couldn't say what happened with that and this is marleig and i know at the asic meeting on wednesday they're going to do a review of the current uh vares data so the data up until this point of vaccine reactions reported in bears so it'll be interesting to see if they uh talk about anything similar to this if we've heard it reported from other users fantastic um so i might just turn it back to dr sosa um and dr thornton being another uh infectious disease expert and and asked what your recommendation might be moving forward would you have this page in your in your mind would you kind of uh have this patient get the second dose and if so um would you have them pre-medicate or post-medicate what is your thought yeah i'll try to to do an analysis it's not an easy answer to be honest i mean if we go as dr smith presented by cdc she um she had a immediate reaction that was treated so if you if you go exactly by that uh you may uh decide not to give the second dose obviously the more severe reaction was the the delay hypersensitivity reaction that she had and my question was basically to roll out a secondary infection because despite the alcohol it's possible to have a cellulitis associated with an injection especially apparently she had like a little bit of a bruise so so there was probably small hematoma in the muscle and you you know as an infectious disease you can think of a secondary infection that actually took a few days to to uh to develop so so that was like my differential is this a hypersensitivity reaction uh to the vaccine or are we seeing like a cellulitis a regular good old cellulitis around an infected hematoma and but that would have been much more painful i mean it would be really painful more than and i would have not responded to to just antihistamines and and things that will will not uh improve an infection so that that was what i was thinking when i asked uh that question um and then the the second the decision about the second dose i think has to do uh i mean i or i would include not only the risk of the second reaction but also the risk of kobe in this patient if this is a patient who let's say lives alone doesn't have like a lot like a you know a huge social network is obviously her age etc you know i would be more willing to to not to give her the second dose to try to continue the the prevention measures and and not give her the second dose there is some evidence very scanty but we have evidence that one dose can confer a protection between 50 and 80 percent uh based on the limited data that we have from the modern and physical vaccine so at least she's not completely unprotected by that dose she has some protection so if if you combine that protection with with maybe uh decreasing the risk of getting covered um i would definitely uh consider not giving her the second dose this my assessment will be different if this is a you know 25 year old nurse that works in the icu with cody patients in her case i would you know consider maybe consulting with an immunologist and and you know and even running the risk of giving her the second dose with some pre-medication and some you know long period of waiting after the vaccine or something along those lines but in an 85 year old who had this you know pretty uncomfortable reaction i would be more more willing to to say okay she got one dose uh let's wait let's wait and maybe we'll give her the protein uh you know the nova backs or some of the other vaccines in the summer uh if we need to do uh like a booster of some type thanks nestor that was extremely comprehensive and i think probably quite helpful to dan um really really helpful i think carla has a comment as well yeah thanks joanna i i was thinking the exact same thing nestor about the potential for cellulitis but i think she probably would have had systemic symptoms if she had that aggressive of a cellulitis or an abscess um you know my other i feel exactly like you do you have to weigh the risk benefit but i i mean i'm just thinking personally if i would have had a reaction like that i probably wouldn't take the vaccine this is my own personal opinion i don't know you know like you said it's going to be i have to be a risk benefit for every patient my other thought was and i know it's not it's not recommended to mix mix these two different types of vaccines is it possible that there was something in that particular vaccine that she had a reaction to and would it be worth giving her a different vaccine the second time for her booster shot that would be one thing to to consider if you if we really felt like she absolutely had to have the second shot but i think overall i would be leaning toward not not giving her a second shot carla this is joanna you know previous to about a week or two ago we heard the cdc say and the fda say in absolutely no circumstances should patients be mixing you know the pfizer and the moderna and you know you should you should go whatever your first dose is should be the second dose and now they've come out with in some situations it is okay to you know uh you know to start with modern and then go to pfizer and or vice versa and i'm just it's just curious to me what those uh what those that you they don't really mention describe particular scenarios but uh that does sound uh that's very interesting and i'm wondering if it's happening more uh with mederna than wiser or what the situation is it also dawns on me that we're such a large uh group of uh clinicians 245 of us that that probably can share uh stories of lot patients that might have symptoms and might be able to help um in some way um with uh with this for the fda could i add something please leslie so i'm on a covid group on facebook covid positions um and um somebody posted a similar reaction and i lost track in the comments but at least 13 people had had a similar reaction almost all of them it was the same of not a huge reaction initially and then eight to ten days out getting that really big reaction almost everybody was on darren i think there were one or two pfizer but the one thing i thought was interesting was the pediatricians were like this is fine we see this five or six times a year with vaccines and it is i've definitely seen it before the localized reaction and it's not a contraindication with pediatric vaccines to getting it again so that's the thing to consider so because we do see it a lot in the pediatric population so so i had a question also um this is for dr sosa um and dr thornton knowing that this uh case that dan presented is a woman who lives in a long-term care facility where she may have a much higher risk for exposures um does that sort of change dan she's not part of the ltc yeah i assume let me jump in quick she uh yeah we had 100 extra doses after our first round and so they opened it up to a community and for firefighters and that sort of thing and she was a member of the community and uh um she's a very active woman and you know he got a social life that she's very valuable to her so she really would like to get the vaccine if you know if we think it's safe but um so yeah anyway sorry for that clarification dan i assumed she was part of the ltch hester saunder do you have a question no i do not okay okay um well dan um did that was that helpful at all to you it was helpful yeah the um uh like i say i i know this woman and i know she wants to get the second shot um but uh uh and it's it's hard giving mixed mixed advice back to her like everything's a risk and a benefit um right the the only you know if i want to parse out the points the really fine points the only thing that i would kind of clarify is that she says the reaction didn't occur in the first four hours did the initial reaction it was lat rather it was the second day and again a strict clear read of the cdc thing says things in the first four hours are immediate reactions and you know obviously we're dealing with a fragile older woman and i don't want to be reckless with her but um you know if i read it carefully that's what it says so [Music] right well thank you we'd love to hear what you decided to do and how she does thank you great i mean one thing i just want to comment i mean there's definitely i think in my opinion there's definitely a risk not not only of uh obviously not an uh like an anaphylactic reaction because she didn't have that but having a more severe local reaction with you know with uh sloughing of the skin etc so that's that's a that's a potential risk because now she's sensitized so she has to receive a booster or whatever antigen she reacts to she she i would say that she has a higher risk now having a more severe local reaction uh one thing that can be done although it's obviously not based on in on evidence is try to determine if she has antibodies and what the level of antibody there's like a a quantification of her uh neutralizing antibodies or just regular elisa antibodies because if he has a good tight or a high titra that may be reassuring for her that she has some degree of protection if on the other hand she's like you know negative and antibodies then then there's uh uh you know more argument in favor of of running the risk of having a you know severe local reaction to induce immunity in her if she's gonna be socially active uh so that you know but that's obviously an individual uh decision that she needs to take and and no no test is perfect but it will give you a little bit more information if you want you know to sort of uh uh fine tune the you know the recommendation to her to measure antibodies maybe a couple of weeks after the the first dose you know she would you can have a levels and maybe even here at the university of mexico some of the researchers can actually determine her levels of neutralizing antibodies and and try to to see if it's comparable to somebody who have already had the disease because we have some you know data on that on on people with convalescent plasma thank you nestor um and just lastly there's some more really really good kind of questions and thoughts in the chat that the majority of these patients that we've talked about today have been women so maybe there's something kind of x-linked in the either in the vaccine or in the kind of uh in the vehicle where the vaccine is in with the uh with the vaccine um yehuda pat mentioned just what you said about getting an antibody tighter um and uh and i think uh that answers most of uh jeffrey miller said could this be similar to a toxin reaction and not an allergic reaction and if so will that change anything um what are your thoughts on that esther right i i mean based on the components of the vaccine uh the most common thing would be just an allergic or a hypersensitivity reaction i mean this vaccine has lipids which are physiologic lipids it has some you know polyethylene glycol which is the the prime suspect of generating this reaction because we've seen uh allergic reactions these compounds before um but i mean unless it was contaminated with something uh it's difficult for me to to to speculate that this is a toxic as opposed to a hypersensitivity i would lean towards hypersensitivity and in fact um i think last week the cdc published in the mnwr the the analysis of the reactions uh severe allergic reactions to the modern vaccine they actually analyze um you know over 400 4 million vaccinies and there was a pretty small uh percentage of of anaphylactic reaction it was like 2.5 per million uh or one per one four hundred thousand uh of severe anaphylactic reaction interestingly enough and this underlies what you mentioned uh a hundred percent of the reactions were in female so it's all it i mean despite the fact that more or less a third of the of the of the people who were vaccinated were male there was zero anaphylactic reaction among males and even severe allergic non-anaphylactic reactions were much more common in females than males uh there's a speculation and there's no data that some cosmetics do have the polyethylene glycol so maybe females in general are more exposed to to this compound before and may be sensitized to the compound and also they have been the description and this is anecdotal also of reactions in people who who inject feeling uh like feelers in the in the in the face um and because that also has some lipids in it that people are sensitized to these lipids using cosmetic uh cosmetic surgery but you know we really don't know why such a striking difference between the allergic reaction in males and females with these two vaccine because the same thing was seen with also with the pfizer pfizer and vaccine also thank you dr sosa dr hayes dr thornton marlon especially dr smith with a great presentation really appreciate it i'm gonna turn back over to dr thornton for some questions we've got 10 minutes left thank you all thanks joanna i just wanted to mention to everybody too that the um uh link for the cme went into the chat a few minutes ago about five minutes ago if people are interested in cme and also giving us any feedback that would be great so there are a lot of questions but i'm going to try to go to the questions that are really related to what the presentation on the brief presentations um to see if we can get through those um let's see there was one question um from dr cybald and nestor about something you discussed does the data on the new covet variant do you reference seem to contradict the normal evolution of viruses to be increasingly transmissible but less deadly you talk about that a little bit right yeah we we actually have discussed this yeah most of the i mean the the theory of evolution is based on the on the fact that uh that you know the more successful an organism is the better uh the more likely it is gonna survive so so if if an organism kills its host presumably it's not gonna be able it's not gonna be as efficient to to continue its existence so so it is sort of counter-intuitive that that a virus will become more lethal because they would basically eliminate the host and will be unable to reproduce as well but this is the observation what they have seen in in england uh recently that that in fact people who are hospitalized with the new variant seems to do poorly and and and you know it goes against the common sense and and the theory of evolution but the other thing is that those are relative risk we have to see the the absolute risk is probably very small but but there is at least an evidence of a 30 percent more severe a clinical disease so but i think we need to wait for more information but that's that's what what it seems despite being counter-intuitive or or against the logical for for for an organism trying to to evolve in their more efficient uh transmission and disease producing great thank you and there are a couple of questions related to the culture scene data that you presented one um is the question is is it is has it been shown to be a benefit once you're intubated does it have to be earlier than that and then there was a question about whether you is there any research to use colchicine prophylactically yeah well uh this study particular called corona i mean they just published some information i look at also at the clinical trial the gulf because it's listed in clinicaltrial.gov and in general the inclusion criteria were to be over 50 to half copied so it was not as a prophylactive it was therapeutic and to have one risk factor those words in general the inclusion criteria so um so you know it's it's basically as an anti-inflammatory not as antiviral that's what the the authors uh or or they commented that this is mostly to decrease the cytokine storm so i i mean i don't see uh i don't see it use as a prophylactic but actually as an anti anti-inflammatory interestingly enough they use it for 30 days it was a long therapy as opposed to some of the other drugs like rendestivia or or even ivermectin that have been studied for one or five days they continue the cultures in 30 days in these uh copy patients and and they show those uh advantages i i haven't seen any studies on on ventilator mechanical ventilator patient but there's there's so this other all other study that i cited the greco story um that it was in a different patient population but i have to review that that paper because i haven't really uh read it in depth thank you very much and a question about the monoclonal antibodies um the study that you talked about in the nursing home the question was is there any eua for monoclonals to be used that way i thought that they were only used immediately after onset of symptoms right i don't think so i think that that's uh that was just a story the blaze too and it hasn't even been published or considered by the guidelines but i you know it's you know based on this story when it's published and reviewed by by fda and by by the the the other regulatory bodies it may be uh the ewa may be increased to prophylaxis but it hasn't really been done and and actually the the the article that commented on that paper uh you know the more we vaccinate this group of patients and they develop immunity the less uh of utility for such an uh such a such a uh um i use for for for the monoclonal because if you're already immunized and you have a good level of antibodies probably the monoclonal is not going to give you any advantage as prophylactic or therapy um just incidentally one use that i see that it hasn't been stolen is in patients that are unable to produce antibodies people who have been treated with uh you know anti-cd20 because they have rheumatoid arthritis or have a gamma global anemia those patients may may benefit from uh instead of getting the vaccine maybe getting bundling up uh you know a couple of times a year or something uh to to at least have some passive immunity but i haven't really seen that uh in the eu and we have had a couple of patients here at unm with with exactly that situation and we haven't been able to use the the anemia map as a passive immunity which is the the intention of such such monoclonal antibodies great thank you very much um there's also they didn't really talk about this but it's related to vaccine an important question um danette brown asked i or said that i've seen articles citing where up to one third of healthcare workers are not getting the vaccine this is very concerning she just wanted to know our thoughts and i hope for the whole hub team if you if you know any different data or what your thoughts are on that whole situation oh i i honestly have not seen much in the in the literature about about vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers so i cannot really open arla do you have any comments yeah i can just sort of share what we've seen in a long-term care facility uh staff and you know in some places virtually everyone has accepted vaccine and in other places it's you know been less than 40 percent of staff what we hear back most commonly is that people are concerned about this new vaccine technology and the speed in which the vaccines received emergency use authorization so people feeling like they just sort of want to wait and see and have more reassurance that the vaccines are safe um over the long term uh before agreeing to be vaccinated we have had some success um and uh certain facilities have reported success back to us in having one-on-one education sessions with facility staff either department of health staff doing that or someone from their federal vaccine partnership coming in and providing direct education to the staff it has really changed a lot of people's minds and people who indicated they would not be vaccinated have then gone on to um accept vaccines so it really just seems being able to answer people's questions um and prevent and present information that they feel is relevant to them um you know more than just directing them to to read a fact sheet um or something on the internet has been helpful in getting people um to be more more likely to be vaccinated than not arla from what i have seen it seems like physicians have really high uptake from what i've been able to tell whereas it seems to be more nurses and the cnas who are really hesitant is that what you have found as well that's what we've seen also yes yeah i think thank you marlo it'll be maybe maybe next week we can talk about the what happens with the verse data or the the way you're going to learn about that just i think the more people see that people i mean today we saw a terrible reaction but see that people are you know that it did um yeah hopefully it's a safe vaccine that that will have better uptake the more people that get it so um we just have a couple of minutes left so we're going to go ahead and close this session please um again the cme link was put in about 12 45 if you're interested in cme um just wanted to announce that um we have a couple of coveted um sessions coming up we have one this afternoon the first respondents uh real resiliency echo is this afternoon at two o'clock right joanna correct two to three yeah and it's um climbing out of the chasm rural ems challenges and opportunities in the postcode era it sounds really interesting we also have critical care but not this week it'll be on february 4th and um the the talk on the critical care echo next week is going to be by alicia parata who runs our postcovid um outpatient clinic and she's got had a ton of experience now so i think it'll be really interesting to hear from her and of course we'll have our kova session next week um office hour over 19 office hours so thank you everyone for joining and we're we're very happy to uh see you every week so we'll see you see you again on monday and just one more plug if anybody has a similar uh a case uh related to covet or vaccine reaction please feel free to contact um either carla thornton or um elena or myself and we'd love to hear about it and have you possibly present so thank you and great case stan thanks so much yeah thanks stan bye,,1/25/2021
35,afternoon everybody can you hear me great okay well welcome to our infectious disease office hours it is uh february 1st today i'm dr joanna katzman i work at project echo and also unm and we have a very busy but very very interesting schedule today that in a few minutes dr nestor sosa is going to talk to you about i'd like to do a few housekeeping items and let you know that if you're new to this echo please turn on your video camera if you have one um we we are not just a webinar format but we really in the line in the spirit of project echo we really want to see your face um it's an all-teach i'll learn and the more that we can have a bi-directional discussion the better so if you do have a video camera please do turn that on it it's certainly fine to eat and drink we realize that for many of you it's your only break time of the day we also want to let you know that we do have an excellent digital librarian kent noseworthy and he'll be putting evidence base and evidence guided material into the chat and you can freely copy and paste that information and use that as you wish 45 minutes after the hour we'll be posting the cme ceu credits for you to obtain that will be in the chat and you should also be getting the powerpoint presentations today from the chat as well and even if you don't need the cme or ceu credits it really helps us if you can fill that those forms out and put in your feelings and thoughts about the session today because we really do look over that deliberately i'd like to briefly introduce my co-facilitator dr carla thornton carla do you want to introduce yourself hi good afternoon everyone welcome i'm carla thornton infectious diseases here at unm and want to hear you carla for some reason i can hear you fine yeah i can hear her i think it's it's just you joanna okay hi hi everyone can you hear me yes okay okay okay carla great um for some reason i could not hear carla um i'll message you joanna and uh i would like to introduce dr nestor sosa who is our leader with all this whole effort nester is the division chief of infectious diseases at the university of new mexico health sciences center and nestor is going to lead off and kind of introduce kind of our special guest today and tell you what what we have in mind dr sosa sure thank you um carla you want to introduce yourself i think we didn't have time to sure just quickly though i'm carl thornton um infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here project echo welcome everyone perfect thank you yeah so today um i just also i don't i'm gonna just have leslie and and marla introduce themselves as well okay leslie go ahead hi leslie hayes family physician espanola new mexico el centro family health yeah we're just introducing our hub team and marla are you i don't see marla are you there oh there you are perfect there you are i am marla seaver's infectious disease epidemiologist with new mexico department of health great thank you perfect okay so i'll i'll take it from here uh so today we're going to have we're going to change a little bit our our routine instead of having our updates right off the bat um dr hayes and i will uh will present our updates a little bit later but because i really want um you to benefit from from the three three speakers that we have today we have um actually three experts on on on genetic sequencing as you know we have been discussing this concern about the variance and the different lineages of the virus and their influence maybe on vaccine or immune response so so today we decided to invite our real experts here from the from the uh from new mexico to talk about what they're doing how they're identifying these variants etc so i'm we're going to have dr michael edwards who's director of the state lab uh we have daryl dolman and daryl dinwiddie which are two scientists from from unm uh that worked precisely in the field of of genomics of of different microorganisms so please i'm going to ask dr edwards to to start i think dario is going to share screen and then introduce yourself um in more details and and take it from here we're all paying attention thank you thank you dr sosa uh my name's michael edwards i as as dr sosa mentioned i'm the director of our state scientific laboratory uh we we focus on uh you know issues of public health concern and uh this obviously is one of those things and uh before we dive too too much into the specifics i did i i think it's important for you all to understand uh though we're far from the end of this um this uh genomic surveillance within the state has uh it's a pretty wide-ranging partnership and it's uh i i would call it a success story uh it's it's something that um we've scaled uh what hasn't been done before here and we have a lot of talent and it's a it's a pretty neat uh story um and it started you know we we're just hearing about the variance over the last few months uh however myself and dr doman dr dimwitty as well as uh dr colbreth that at tricore and our epidemiologist partners at uh in the department of health and uh those uh those of uh our partners at los alamos national lab were talking about um our genomic surveillance back in march of 2020. this is something we've been working on for a while and we're continuing to scale up and it's put us in a position where we're able to be of service as these variants appear um let's move to the next slide so um so you know this this isn't the first you know this is our first effort in uh public health genomic surveillance it's something that in my laboratory and and throughout um you know the nation and and the world frankly uh we we we participate in uh one example um on on the left is our national molecular uh foodborne disease surveillance network pulse net and over the last couple years fortunately we've moved away from an antiquated molecular uh typing technique pulsefield gel electrophoresis and just over the last two to three years have shifted over to next generation sequencing and and really i it's for us in public health it's laid the foundation for uh for this event um i will say however you know we use this to identify outbreaks uh linking individuals with uh enteric diseases uh to uh to specific foodborne uh you know sources uh and but we're dealing with hundreds of people uh we're dealing with you know hundreds of individuals that may have salmonella or shigella or equal io157 another example in the middle is the anti biotic resistance laboratory network uh through cdc um it's it's you know it's comprised of public health laboratories throughout the country uh with hubs regionally uh where we're able to uh characterize you know cres and other uh uh anti antibiotic resistance uh microbes uh through sequencing um it's and again however we're not dealing with the scale that that we're talking about here and and again it's it's helped lay the foundation for what we're doing uh with uh coronavirus surveillance and then the last uh spheres which is our our coronavirus surveillance network which was established shortly after the pandemic started um you know by the the centers for disease control and prevention along with a collection of academic institutions uh public health laboratories uh corporations and non-profits if you if you have you know really good vision you can look at that and we're well represented in this group both my laboratory as well as uh university of new mexico with with dr dimwitty dr doman and uh los alamos national lab and uh we'll talk more about what we've done but uh to date you know we per capita we are one of the leaders in the country uh with with the number of genomes where we've been able to sequence and uh now now what use is that um in uh foodborne outbreak you know we're dealing with smaller populations we're able to trace back and and really stop the spread of the disease uh with with our current pandemic it it makes it a little more difficult since the virus is rampant um so i think that there are a lot of questions with coronavirus that we can't ask um and i think they're they're important to ask because they're going to set the stage with what we can do uh you know what's causing the outbreak you know was there a source was there a super spreader event where did the outbreak begin uh when did it begin how many introductions have there been um you know are outbreaks or cases linked uh what's the resistance profile right that's that's really um kind of questions that are being asked with some of these new variants how is the pathogen evolving what are the new variants what's what's pressing uh the pathogen to evolve certain ways um so we're gonna dive a little bit deeper into that and uh and then kind of get a little bit uh and then towards the end of this we'll get more specific with some of these emerging pathogens so i'm going to hand off the the presentation now great so uh my name is daryl dinwiddie i'm an assistant professor in the department of pediatrics here at the university of new mexico and i'm in um the division of genetics so one of the things i think that's important to consider when we talk about genome sequencing is how this differs from kind of the standard of care clinical diagnostic testing that you guys are probably pretty familiar with so with specifically with cyrus coronavirus ii we are looking at a viral genome that is approximately 30 000 nucleotides in length it is an rna virus and the way most diagnostic testing is done is through a qpcr type of assay or a nucleic acid assay that is just looking for small regions of this genome and normally there's one to two to three different regions of the genome that each assay is targeting and you look for the presence or absence of these regions of the genome using a quantifiable pcr test however with genome sequencing what we're doing is we're looking at the entire genome of the virus so this allows us to not only look at you know the presence or absence of the virus but we're able to get down to the single individual nucleotide level and look for individual variants and go across all of the genes in the genome and what's important about this is that this really gives us the highest resolution data for the specific virus a specific strain that is coming from each individual sample so we are using technologies called next generation sequencing if you are unfamiliar with these these are newer versions of just kind of typical dna or rna sequencing methodologies but they enable us to to do it in a much more rapid and much larger scale than is normally done with sanger sequencing so the the methods that we use in the lab are similar but uh slightly different from kind of your clinical diagnostic testing paradigm we will get a swab sample similar to most places and same thing we that is generally done is we isolate rna the main difference here is instead of using one to two different regions or maybe three regions of the genome with a couple different pcr primer pairs we are actually using 220 pcr primer sets that tile across the entire genome of the virus after we've done that pcr step we then move into a next generation sequencing library prep and this is where we can add things that allow us to go on to the sequencer but we can also individually barcode each sample so we're able to sequence samples from multiple patients at the same time and that barcode links us to the individual person um the sequencing being done uh in our state and in our laboratory and at the department of health and then um also predominantly around the world are using two main technologies a nanopore sequencer from a company called oxford nanopore technologies or an illumina sequencing technology and in my laboratory in the doh laboratory we have the aluminum my seek platform although they have multiple uh platforms from the company illumina that can sequence these viruses and as and as uh dr edwards said earlier we've been doing this throughout the pandemic you may not have heard about it but we've been tracing um the virus and the pandemic using genome sequencing throughout the whole time so early on we were able to look in march and april we were able to look at some of these early transmission dynamics look at introductions into the state um unfortunately when the the the peak of the pandemic started to really increase in october and november our resources kind of got split into doing diagnostic testing so we don't have as many of the genomes from there but really then at the beginning of this year with the concerns of these new variants that we're going to talk about we really wanted to ramp up the sequencing to include as many samples as possible so we can get a better idea of if we do have any of these variants so as you can see in january um so far we have sequenced the the most virus samples throughout the time of the pandemic so we between the two laboratories here we have sequenced over 450 virus samples since just in january alone all right um can can everyone hear me so this is this is other daryl from unm daryl doman um i thought i would just give uh sort of an overview and flavor of of what this data kind of looks like and what we can say with it um primarily in an epidemiological context and so um you know we're looking at genetic data so a t's g's and c's um and you know really the crux of all of this is we know that sars code v2 is mutating about once every two weeks and really what's the what this translates to is about every other step in the transmission chain we have a new mutation so you know kind of exactly like uh the game of telephone where you know you're whispering a secret and it goes around the the the chain um that's you know akin to what's happening with the virus as it's mutating from person to person along a transmission chain and so we can actually use this sequence data to essentially reconstruct the family tree of the viral transmission chain and basically answer the question of whom infected whom and so this approach is very complementary uh to case based reporting and contact tracing but it allows us to answer and sort of get at this question in a completely novel way than really how we've been doing things previous and so you know we can trace back from that previous slide you know back to a common ancestor and so when we're looking at this data we typically are viewing things in what are called phylogenetic trees and these reveal the evolutionary relationships and histories of the samples that we're sequencing so the samples that we would be sequencing are at the ends of the trees and essentially this tells you um you know what sort of relationship these samples have in common so in this sort of cartoon diagram these blue samples are grouping together they have a common ancestor here these orange samples grouped together they have a common ancestor here and this green sample is kind of off by itself and and what this sort of phylogenetic tree tells you is uh on the x-axis it's genetic distance so how dissimilar or similar a sample is and so the shorter these the shorter the x-axis is here the more closely related these samples are and so this is actually quite important in that by using this information um about these isolates and how they're related we can start to make inferences on the likelihood of positive cases being linked um so i typically use an example of an outbreak within a school but it can be a hospital ward or a clinic sort of any scale of resolution this applies to and if you have two positive cases an obvious question to ask is whether or not there was spread within say a school or if these were two independent samples and so if you were to look at the genetic data and you saw that the samples were grouping together you might then for instance say that these cases might be linked and that there was spread within the school or a clinic but equally important is being able to rule things out so if the data came back and looked like this we might say actually these are two independent cases the school or clinic could remain open because it doesn't look like there's community spread within that facility and that these cases were sort of independently uh acquired and so a really sort of simple example but very uh critically important is answering the question that's been circulating around about whether or not folks are reinfected with a different strain or they're in fact chronically infected with the same strain so here i'm showing two samples from our partners in wyoming public health that we sequenced here at unm um where an individual had tested positive over 90 days apart and the question of course was is this the same strain or was it a different uh a different strain for the reinfection and of course you can see here that within the phylogenetic tree we have two separate places which indicates that in fact this individual was reinfected with a second strain and not a chronic infection great so um let's now bring it back to kind of some of these variants of concern that you've probably heard about in the media um so these are really these three strains that we are most interested in right now although we we fully anticipate that there will be additional strains as the virus continues to evolve throughout this pandemic that we're looking for and i should point out we're not only looking just for these three we're looking for any specific strain or new variant or new mutation in a region of the virus that we believe may have an impact on clinical severity or efficacy of the vaccines or or anything else but the the ones you guys have been hearing about in the media are b117 so this has also been called the uk variant and it has become the dominant strain in the the united kingdom it has a large number of mutations um compared to the the early uh strain of cyrus coronavirus about 23 specific mutations one that we are we hear a lot about that we believe is really important in transmission is this 501 y mutation in the spike protein um so a lot of the variance that strains that we're looking at will have this variant within it currently the b117 has been detected in 73 countries so it's spread globally so although it's called the uk variant we're not even sure if it originated there they were just able to detect it early on because of their broad-scale genomic surveillance processes we have detected two cases in new mexico and these are associated with travel to the uk and we'll speak a little bit more about those later and there is now increasing evidence that this may actually be associated with severe more severe disease than other strains initially we didn't believe that but it takes a while to generate the data and to analyze it so there is concern not only that is it more transmissible but it may also be associated with more severe disease the next variant strain that you may have heard about is the b1351 or the south african variant this one also has a 501y mutation but it occurred independently of the one in the uk and it has two additional mutations in the spike protein that that are potentially concerning and may alter the ability of antibodies or vaccine induced antibodies to recognize the strain there is ongoing research to look at the ability of this strain to escape from antibodies and there's still uh some data being generated on if that is true or not but early evidence suggests that this may not be as susceptible to the antibodies that have been generated by natural exposure or from the the vaccine there are no cases detected in the united states or sorry there are no cases detected in new mexico the first case detected in the the united states was reported last week and that was in south carolina the next one that you may have heard about particularly this weekend there was some articles on npr about it this is called p1 or the brazilian strain and you'll notice it has three main mutations in the spike protein very similar to the south african variant but this is a different lineage and it has occurred separately from the south african variant and scientists are concerned about it because it's spreading quite rapidly in brazil even in areas where there's been high levels of previous infections so the concern with this one is that it may actually not be susceptible to antibodies produced during previous infections and it's important that no cases of this have been detected in new mexico so far there have been one case reported in minnesota and that was a family who had a travel history to brazil so we're concerned about variants because they have the potential to increase the ability to spread to people um as we've seen with some of the uk strain we're also interested in is are there differences in disease severity between these different strains and these different variants another key is the ability of these viruses when you start having mutations in them you may be they may actually start failing some of the diagnostic testing uh methods that are currently being used and that is actually indeed one of the the reasons we were able to find the uk variant is because one diagnostic test that four stars kobe 2 actually does not detect that strain so i think mike will talk about that in a little bit we're also interested in what is the susceptibility to therapeutics and then as i kind of already mentioned were concerned about the ability of these viruses to evade either natural or vaccine-induced immunity i'm sure i i can take this slide real quick uh we're kind of ping-ponging between this so um you know so just as a whole uh you know dr dinwiddie just gave an overview of these different variants um you know and here's a a page that i clipped from the cdc website um over the weekend in terms of of how many of these cases have been found in the u.s um so of the uk variant that b117 there have been you know right around 430 so far at least um as of jan 30 um and it's been detected in uh 30 states so um quite uh widespread so far in the united states uh the b uh one three five one so this would be the south african variant uh present in two states or sorry two cases um and then the p1 like dr dinwiddie said uh was found in minnesota so just one one so far but i think we all anticipate um quite sensibly uh that um especially the b117 i think there's lots of um consensus that this strain will likely become the more dominant strain by march um i think there's pretty general consensus on that and of course i think we expect with folks still traveling internationally that we'll start to see these other two variants increase in frequency as as time goes on okay i thought i would uh talk a little bit about um our specific case here uh of b117 that we were able to detect uh in the state or actually two cases that that came from the same cluster uh as daryl had mentioned uh we were tipped off and it was specifically by uh the pcr test we that we run here at the state laboratory we we use the the thermo fisher tac path multiplex assay and the the nice thing is these diagnostic tests are set up with redundancy uh which allows us to you know if if something goes wrong we can still pick up uh if the patient has had a case of of cobit so our assay uh targets three separate genes within the within the virus genome uh the open reading frame or 1a as well as the the s gene and then the n gene and in in the case of uh these these two positives when [Music] when we ran the the test uh the the orf 1a target as well as the engine target uh looked great uh i think everyone is fascinated with uh ct values nowadays uh they they were in the low twenties it it looked really nice however the s gene uh the it failed to uh to give us a cp value and uh you know this wasn't novel we we knew that um that that this there was a likelihood that this could be a uh a b117 so we immediately threw it on our sequencer and uh you know and so that we can kind of uh we can get an idea of you know whether or not it in fact was b117 uh interestingly enough even after we had the positive our our epidemiologists uh or the contact tracers uh talk to the individual and there was no report of travel it was only after the the sequence was confirmed b117 and they they talked with the individual that it came out that that an individual within this cluster had traveled to the uk and i i you know it was nice having a having a tip off that we had we in fact had a potential b117 uh but this uh this trick pretty much only works with this uh well this uh variant of interest the other two variants that uh dr uh dome and dr dimwitty talked about uh do not cause such uh they're not gonna show up uh uniquely on our test uh which then you know stresses that need you know especially as we're looking at variants coming from you know coming internationally or from other parts of the country they need to screen uh travel i think if you know our epidemiologist friends would be stressing that right now uh so the the only right now we're able to sequence a small fraction of the positives that we're detecting in the state and uh the only way to hit small amounts um is either you know i mean it's uh to either find targeted ways of doing it or to increase the the number of uh genomes that we're able to to run uh right now you can see in new mexico where we're it's showing here 0.665 percent of our positives we're able to sequence thus far um i i will say that we're seeing that number increase um i think you all if you remember that the graph that was shown earlier that january we saw our biggest month in number of genomes sequenced uh we're pushing closer but uh we we don't have the resources to to sequence everything uh we're we're going to uh you know you know is it possible that one of these variants could come in and we're not going to catch it of course but again i think there's there's lots of other things that can be done including you know the clinicians talking with uh with patients if if that's possible or you know and again i think uh you know dr colbrat that tri course talked about you know developing other targeted assays for some of these specific variants there there's a lot of neat things that can happen um is that the last slide yes so i i don't um you know as i said at the beginning this is a this is a pretty big group uh we've been working at this uh pretty handily you know daryl and daryl's group at at university of new mexico my group that the state department of health uh tricor's been a great partner in los alamos national lab has been been big as well um i don't know if if either of you two daryls want to say anything else yeah i just want to reiterate i didn't have time to update this slide for this but you know as dr edwards was saying you know uh between our collaborations i i think in the this last uh push um in in december and january i think you know already new mexico was within the top five states in terms of of sequences per 100 cases and you know i think with this latest push i think we're we're probably over one percent um now which is is you know a sort of milestone that we'd like to keep up and eventually hopefully hit around five percent um but i think you know it just goes to show you know when we pull together between the academic labs and the dohs and form these excellent partnerships and now bringing on uh lanl you know for for a small state with limited budgets we can really sort of punch above our weight in terms of of being able to do a really nice act of surveillance for sars kobe 2. thank you so much nestor did you want to yeah yes thank you first of all i i really would like to congratulate uh you know the three of you i mean the work that you're doing really uh make us proud and and and you know we know that they're they're not unlimited resources in the state and nevertheless we are really on you know very high on the on the on the list of of states uh regarding sequences so so really thank you thank you for all the work and thank you for the for the lecture i have a couple of questions while uh carla and joanna looked at the chat um and some of the questions were already already answered so first it's just a curiosity how long does it take to sequence a sample let's say you do one sample it does take a day an hour five hours i have no idea how long does it take to to sample and how much it costs i mean is it in the hundreds of dollar ones one sequence can you elaborate on those two question time and cost for for sequencing uh sure i'll i'll tackle this um it can vary i think generally we batch the the samples that we sequence um to do that is to help reduce the cost per sample um we can generally turn around a virus sequence if if we want to in about three days or two days is kind of we could make it faster but that would be kind of manning people around the clock so that currently right now we can we generally are generating a genome sequence in about three days but sometimes we have to wait until we we get enough samples to create a batch to reduce the cost um and coming down to cost that's highly variable and it depends on the sequencing technology we're using and we're working on ways to reduce that um but i think what uh what broadly people are stating um when you don't include it's harder if you include technician time or whatever but we're talking about two hundred dollars a sample um there are ways where you can kind of reduce the amount of reagents being used and stuff where we can get that down but i think a fairly commonly uh produced numbers about a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars per sample okay excellent my second question was i think partly answered by dr heathers i just wanna um can can uh like a simple pcr test be designed to detect like the n501 as opposed to doing the just the whole the 30 000 you know uh um uh the genome the complete genome can can can like like a pcr for that region the 501 and if you find the mutation then you go and sequence that is is that in somebody else's mind yeah that's that's definitely something that can be done and as i mentioned uh dr colbrath at tricor is very interested in in in setting something up at her laboratory to you know when once we you know communicating with us and her developing pcr assays that she can detect these variants at a much larger scale okay and last i think this question i also saw in the chat but i had it myself do you think at this point uh the antigen tests are affected by these mutations or or there's no evidence of that i haven't really found any anything in the literature i know about the the spike drop that you guys mentioned but um is there any risk that that the sensitivity of the of some of the antigen tests may fall uh because of this mutation uh in the short run possible i i mean you you are you know theoretically changing the you know the 3d uh composition of of the protein you're deleting a few amino acids um i haven't seen anything either but it makes sense that that that's definitely a possibility i can jump in and answer this this is cecilia thompson i'm associate medical director of infectious disease testing at tricor we have been in very close conversations with our testing manufacturers to try to answer those exact questions and at least the binax now should not be affected by some of the current spike variants it detects the n-protein so it should not be detected that doesn't mean the future variant could disrupt that but currently um that test should not be affected excellent thank you and thank you now i'll add to that real quick that we're actually sequencing a lot of the binax now positive cases that are occurring at the unm emergency department so we we have the ability to kind of keep track of that as new variants come up so those that's one of the tests that we are using to get positive samples from excellent carla you want to continue or order anna sure thank you nestor um thank you so much for that really excellent presentation and thank you cecilia for introducing yourself and helping out as well please um we would love to hear from you as well um i'm just going to go to the chat um leslie do you want to unmute yourself and ask the question you had about the case that was discussed yeah the case where you had the guy who um you retested 90 some days later and found it was a different genomic strain had you done the testing the first time around or did you still have the nasal swab left over to go back and say oh you know here's joe's nasal swab from january of last year or whatever it may have been yeah i'll take that this one um yeah i mean so we've been partnering with the wyoming public health lab um you know almost uh hand in hand as we have with nmdoh you know since march or april and so i think this was a uh sort of a targeted surveillance effort where um wyoming public health lab had flagged this individual as having uh two positive uh nasopharyngeal swabs and so we got synthos or into our between dinwiddie and i those two samples to test this specifically whether or not it was reinfection or different strain so i guess my question is if i have a patient who had an infection back in august and then gets effect infected again now would that swab still be available to run those or um is it going to be that you need to know it sort of ahead of time that you want to do it no i think they i mean i from my i think i can speak for for dr edwards here that i think they are banking samples and same with tricore so you know i think you can go back and freeze or dive so to speak for certain um swabs of interest or viral transport media of interest great thank you so i will say though that you know we've you know as the pandemic has gone along there have been more and more laboratories that have gotten involved uh you have antigen tests and these other things that uh you know my laboratory we do a really good job at banking positives i know tricorder does an excellent job but not everyone does that so the more diversity that you have of diagnostic tests the harder it is to catch those and even i mean even earlier on uh you know we we had samples sent out of state and it became a challenge to uh to find those uh because you know maybe you know we had a positive that showed up you know several months later and they wanted us to go back and it turned out that the the original was at labcorp or something like that so it's it is a challenge thank you um cecilia did you ha did you have any comments about that uh no we are continuing to save samples um like uh dr george is saying that there is a lot of there are a lot of testing modalities and sending samples um but we've done our best to try to bank as many as possible thank you very much um jeffrey miller do you want to mute yourself and ask your question sure my question is i'll have to pull it up but i can remember it uh basically that uh for many of us now vaccinated you know the question is is whether we uh if we're exposed to coven 19 would we be protected from transmitting it to somebody else and we just don't know that information yet and it seemed like this technology would be applicable to that i just wondered whether i presume it's being pursued and if so what data if any there is yeah um i can take this question yeah i mean that that is a an excellent sort of use case for genomics um uh it's i think it's it's tricky um in that i um answering that question would require likely someone who is very very little symptomatic or asymptomatic to know and get tested um and so uh you know i i'm sure i'm sure uh that this is being pursued actively in some circles some academic circles um but off the top of my head i have not heard anything specifically about you know any data being generated post vaccination and and following up with sequencing um i i'm not sure if dr edwards or dinwiddie or anyone else has heard yeah i can just i'm sorry i was gonna say i'm aware of some studies going on but i don't know if they are incorporating genome sequencing in those studies but i know there are some people healthcare workers who have been vaccinated that are getting swabbed consistently for to see if they become carriers yeah with the two most recent trials the the novabax vaccine and uh and the johnson and johnson they they did some uh sequencing because they were enrolling patients in the uk and in south africa so they know uh what percentage of their infections are with the new variants and and that's something that that data is going to be made public you know in the next few weeks but i know that they are looking into that and in fact um they found less uh efficacy or efficacy with that with the vaccines in those areas especially in the uk there was a significant drop in the in the efficacy of the vaccine so yeah so they they are they are uh at least sequencing some of these positive uh impulse vaccination cases um or pro placebo also because they they were uh double blind stories so they were sequencing both those who received the active vaccine and the placebo and and and they know if they were infected with uh with the variant or not thank you thank you nestor um dr seibold would you like to unmute yourself and ask your question hi yes and uh thank you for the presentation that was fascinating i was wondering if there's some speculation perhaps that any of those three variants we spoke about would be resistant to monoclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibody therapy and if so would perhaps a different clone be effective and as anybody working down that line of thinking um yeah i'll go ahead and take this we haven't done anything in this particularly but i have seen that research is ongoing and there are indications that these strains these particular which is one of the reasons they are a variant of concern strain is that they do seem to be less susceptible to some of these monoclonal antibody therapies one of the things i have seen is that if they are used in combination however that the they are more effective against thieves but um i've seen a couple things released on it but we're not particularly ourselves directly really involved in that research thank you very much there are a couple of questions just about vaccine trials um just one of the questions have the three vaccines been trialled versus the new strain and will a new vaccine against the new strains have to go through phase one two and three or will they say that they are similar and can just go into production anybody talk about that i can take that one yeah i mean the the i think it's it's going to be inevitable if you do a study now um especially if you do it in europe or or south america and you include brazil or south africa you are going to have patience with the new variants because they're becoming dominant in many geographic areas so that's almost a given that that if you do if you want to try a new vaccine they're going to be you know they're going to be screened or they're going to be uh test in in the real world so so you're going to have some patience with the with the new and so patient with the old variant so that's and i think it's it's it's interesting and in fact people are already um commenting that the high efficacy of serve with uh with pfizer and moderna was in the pre-variant era because they they enroll patients you know may june july and they got the results you know really rapidly and and um but with the new vaccines like like the latter part of astra seneca uh nova box and johnson and justin were in areas uh with the new variants and and that that may explain in part some of the difference in in the efficacy at least in the clinical trials but yeah i think this is going to that's going to be a must to try your vaccines against the tougher strains that's i think that's our requirement yeah and i think just to follow up i think i've heard that moderna specifically is announcing that it will start adding in the uh the variants to i think kind of their their new production line whether or not that has to go through a separate regulatory mechanism i am unsure um and i haven't heard about pfizer specifically but i do know that that modena is is really looking into developing um these new variants in their vaccine pfizer is as well they're both working on um both pfizer and moderna because of their technology the mrna vaccines they're able to add these quite quickly so both of them are doing that carla if you want i can share my screen and show the results of the nova box because we're talking about these nova backs and johnson and johnson which were part of my my update for today um yeah absolutely go ahead let me see if i can i just want to remind everybody while he's pulling that up that they're um uh that the the cme link just went into the chat a little while ago if you're interested in seeing me please go ahead and um fill that out nestor can you switch the the disc yeah go ahead and we would love to hear your feedback as well yeah so first a disclaimer these two um are actually press releases for the investors so this is not a paper so we we have to wait for the for the actual publication of the phase three uh of these two vaccines but but johnson and johnson uh announced the results of their phase free trial um so-called the ensemble trial and it's it's published in their in their web jnj.com for those who want to check it out and and in summary this is a study it's a phase three uh with a large uh relatively large sample of subjects i'm sorry they use an adenovirus vector vaccines adenovirus 26 they randomize one to one to placebo important completely different um design this is to a one dose evaluation so they the only problems the results on the one dose of the vaccine they enroll over 40 000 participants 45 percent were male 34 were over 60 and they did it in all over the united states all over the world 44 in the u.s south america including brazil and 50 in south africa and this is important so they they did enroll patients where those uh new variants are circulating um they had a a pretty decent distribution of race and ethnicity 19 black 45 hispanics or latinx and their main point and this is also important and this is a different from the modern and physical they look at moderate and severe copies so not just covet uh symptomatic if you remember when we discussed the modern and physical they only look for like one symptom or maybe two symptoms but these this um this study actually looked a very uh very severe moderate and severe covet and in fact they define moderate um evidence of pneumonia so they have to have a rhiographic infiltrate or a dvt or shortness of breath of less than 90 saturation so these are pretty sick this is not the usual i have a fever and sore throat type of coffee it's really moderate and severe obviously our patients in icu with with respiratory support so so the if efficacy that we're going to show is actually ethically efficacy against what we call severe moderate or severe disease and this is what they found first of all they found an overall efficacy of 66 percent um and this is remember just one shot but it was it was different in different geographic areas and this is gonna talk uh this reflects about the what we have been discussing about the variant look the the efficacy in the u.s was 72 percent presumably no variance was circulating or very very a few of these new variants were circulating in the u.s when they did this story but look at the result in south africa 57 so much lower than in the us and lower even uh than than the overall efficacy uh and they said well that another another important thing is that they prevented 85 percent of the severe cases the patients going into icu and in fact another phenomenon which you have seen in immunology the longer uh time after the the those the better the immune system um gets are fighting the disease so they found a hundred percent uh prevention of disease or vaccine efficacy more than 49 days and that's because of the improving the affinity of the of the antibodies as as they mature in the in the germinal centers in the lymph node uh regarding safety there was no like red flag they uh in this press release they said no anaphylactic reaction it was well tolerated quote-unquote and the data safety monitoring board didn't didn't raise any any concern but again the most striking finding is 72 efficiency here and 57 percent in south africa probably reflecting and in fact a lot of the patients in south africa had the variant the the other vaccine that that released its results the phase three was the nova backs nova box is a protein it's one of the old platform it's a protein adjuvant adjuvanted protein uh platform and they found a native 89 efficacy in in the uk so this includes a lot of the patients with with the variant and well it was also a relatively large trial 15 000 subjects uh ages from 18 to 84. um in fact one third were over 65 and this is a two dose uh so a primary and booster regimen two doses and they found this overall efficacy which is closer to what we have seen with with pfizer and modern 89.3 but interestingly enough the same phenomenon um the vaccine efficacy in the uk against um it was overall 86 um in overall but when you look at the old variants it was 95.6 so it was higher in the old uh or wall type virus compared to the to the new strain and in south africa it dropped to exactly the same percentage as we saw with the johnson and johnson 60 it was 57 with the johnson and johnson 60 with the nova back so so here we see this phenomenon occurring okay so i'm going to start sharing i have some other updates but i'll give you next week when we have more times in case we want to continue the discussion so those are the two like newest vaccines and they are already reflecting the impact of the of these new variants uh in a significant significant fashion carla yeah thank you mr um a couple more questions that we have time for i'm sorry we're not going to get to all of them i apologize again um uh carol hennessy asked does reinfection by other strains indicate that waiting 90 days after infection for vaccine may not be wise i don't know marla maybe you can chime in on this one yeah i mean i think really the recommendation that people could wait up to 90 days to be vaccinated from their original infection is really just speaking to the current vaccine availability rather than um you know another reason concern you know about safety or efficacy of the vaccine so it's really about trying to vaccinate people who have absolutely no immunity while we're in this constrained vaccine supply phase um so you know i think if you're able to be vaccinated beforehand and there's adequate supplies to do so there's no reason not to be vaccinated earlier than the 90 days thank you very much um and then um joanna kassmann unfortunately she got she got her internet went down but she had asked is there more federal funding for genomic surveillance such as you are doing is that something that's going to be well funded hopefully in the near future daryl you're shaking or daryl either one of you whoever wants to do it i mean we certainly hope so um yeah you know i think there's you know we're actively pursuing nih and cdc contracts to keep the lights on at least from the unm side um yeah i mean so i think i think there's certainly um lots of steam now behind ramping up nationally uh our surveillance efforts um i think you know now now the public is well aware of the importance of detecting these variants and so i think that's given us uh some wind in our sails in terms of forward momentum and and hopefully some funding strategies michael are you gonna say something yeah i was just gonna say um so there are also um there there are cdc uh funding streams that are coming out for um enhanced detection uh and you know to help us and then i'm trying to find ways also to to funnel money to them to keep their life on as well because as it's been i've shown i think that their efforts are as important as what we're doing here so i think having the capacity uh you you knock down one of the legs of our stool it's gonna fall so i think we we need them funded too great thank you and then one very interesting last question um dr seibel asks when the virus is mutating as fast as the presenters say how do we determine or define when that virus represents a quote new strain and a quote sort of answered this in the in the chat so usually how we're defining clades or new lineages are by shared mutations you know in the whole cluster so there's there's groups that are actively working on this um there's a fantastic group that's that supports um this platform called nextstrain.org where you can sort of visualize the global transmission chain and then kind of zoom in on states i can type that into the chat here but it's usually defined when you know there's a substantial sort of break off of a cluster of of samples that all share sort of defining mutations um so it's not just one-offs that become new strains you know you you kind of get a critical mass and then uh sort of a group of folks get together and scientists say well yeah should we name this a variant or not and i mean it's it's now a very active sort of discussion point on you know when we name something a variant of concern um and things like that but yeah that's a great question yeah i'll just i'll just add that you know even within different virus fields that this is a question that is still unanswered in many cases so what becomes a rhinovirus strain versus a serotype is different than what for influenza versus coronavirus so when all these rna viruses there's enough genetic variability that very few are identical so when you classify something as a strain is somewhat um dependent upon the experts in that field when they kind of agree upon different criteria and it's actually different for each virus yeah thank you so much i hate to cut this great conversation off but we are at the top of the hour thank you so much for presenting we would love to have you back whenever you want to come and answer questions i'm sure there'll be many of them in the future i just wanted to remind everybody about um the cme link and also about our upcoming covet echoes there's one this afternoon the first responder echo on resiliency and then there's also a critical care echo this week at eight o'clock um on thursday morning with dr harkins and alicia peratta who runs our postcode clinic is going to come on and talk about her experience now they've had a ton of patients they've been seeing in that clinic so that should be interesting so um thank you so much for joining and we will see you next week,,2/1/2021
36,we'll get started in just one second actually just right now we're going to get started um good good afternoon everyone thank you for joining today welcome to cobia 19 office infectious diseases office hours on february 8th we're really happy to see everybody on this beautiful day in new mexico i'm sorry to those who aren't here in the sunshine with us um we're gonna go ahead and get started with some introductions i just want to let everybody know if you have any questions during this session please put them into the chat and we'll try to get to all of the questions possible that we can get to today um we would ask that if you that you not actually answer other people's questions in the chat unless we call on you specifically to do that or you're a member of the hub team and i wanted to let you know that our digital librarian is here today um and we'll be putting things into the chat of interest to everybody throughout the session so please um keep an eye on that as well so i'm gonna go ahead and get started with introductions i'd like to introduce my co-facilitator joanna katzman joanna you want to introduce yourself sir hi everybody joanna katzman i'm a neurologist and i work with carla to help co-facilitate this program thank you thanks joanna and i'm carla thornton infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and we'll just introduce our hub team as they give their updates so i'm going to go ahead and turn it over to you nestor and let you introduce yourself okay thank you hi this is nasro salsa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm let me start my update for today let me just put it on full screen all right so first of all i wanted to give you sort of an update because we have so many news on the on the vaccine efficacy or efficacy that i wanted to sort of run by by you all all of the vaccines that we have so so far we have the pfizer biontech vaccine with an efficacy of or efficacy of 95 the moderna 94. the astra seneca um the published trials actually if you look at all the trials it's it's a combined efficacy of 70 percent um most of these vaccines have they had a very high um efficacy against severe disease almost close to a hundred percent and that's important although there's there's some differences in the prevention of mild disease all of them so far um are almost 100 percent effective against severe disease or death or hospitalization due to call it the other vaccines oh sorry the other vaccines that are on the market in some other countries or will be in the market in the u.s are the sputnik vaccine which i'm going to be talking a little bit about today 91.6 uh the only inactivated uh one of the few inactivated vaccine that has been studied in different countries the sino farm and from china and also the cyanobac both of them have given very broad efficacy ranges 79 to 86 and you can see the sino back in brazil was 50 percent but in two other countries 95 in turkey and 65. these are unpublished uh results these are usually communicated in the press or in the in the company web page and then the other two that are in line to be approved in the u.s probably in the next weeks or month are the johnson and johnson the nova backs novavax is a protein uh johnson and johnson is just adenovirus is a vector vaccine with the narrow virus 26 and you can see nova backs an efficacy of 89 in the uk um but 60 in south africa and you're gonna see that that's a problem that we are seeing with these vaccines in south africa as you know they have the the majority of the subject have this new variant so it's obviously um the efficacy of the vaccine goes down when when you vaccinate uh in an area where there's one of these variants that seems to escape the controlled by the vaccines and the johnson and johnson this is the only one that is a single shot 72 percent in the u.s trial 66 in latin america and again lower efficacy in south africa 57 so really interesting and i think yesterday there was this news about astra seneca in south africa they um they actually the south african health authorities are not using or recommended to stop the usage of astrazeneca because of its low um efficacy among among the patients infected with the south african variants so so bad news for astrosenica at least in this part of the world in south africa where the efficacy seems to be below 20 percent i i've seen published 22 percent and and um well we don't know because this this this decision was based on a small trial with young healthy people we don't know if it prevents severe disease because the study was not designed to do that but it definitely doesn't seem to be preventing mild disease uh so that's that's the reason why south africa is probably going to look into other vaccines like um like either nova box johnson and johnson or pfizer for for their um for the public health uh uh intervention and talking about vaccines although i know it's unlikely the sputnik 5 will be in the market in the us if anything for political uh reasons and things but i just wanted to run run by you the publication that they had in in lancet out of just you know sake of completeness and for the sake of science because we have been mentioning that we don't have you know data on sputnik so they published their phase 3 trial um on landsat just a few days ago february the 2nd so this is a study of safety and efficacy of this vaccine which is basically recombinant non-replicative adenovirus 26 in the first dose so they use one type of vector in the first dose similar to the johnson and johnson and then the second vaccination is with an another adenovirus so that in order to prevent the immune system from recognizing adenovirus 26 they're repeating the dose but in this time they use a different human adenovirus and this is different from remember from astroceneca which were chimpanzee adenovirus these are human so they give you you know common cold and other and other infections uh so but but in this case are non-replicative recombinants so they they should not produce any disease um and they publish a this is an interim analysis so there are some things that they are not communicating in this trial uh but it's an interim analysis that they wanted to get out and then the principal author or the first author was loganoff and uh so they did the the design is slightly different to the ones that we have seen this is a three to one uh randomization so three times more people receive the vaccine uh than the placebo so you will see the numbers in the blazing arm are much larger almost fifteen thousand here five thousand here just to to give a round number and um one one important difference and this was done exclusively in russia so as you can see almost 100 of the participants were white or caucasian no latinx no hispanic no black so this is important when we think about generalizing these conclusions um and um and well though there were some age distribution important and this this is something which may be an issue for regulatory authorities only 10 of the subjects were over age of 60. so obviously this is relatively small numbers if you compare with the moderna and and physically which they usually do many more many more elderly subjects or or older subjects so here the percentage were were significantly smaller and we go directly to the results oh this this was for some reason we moved but actually uh what i wanted to show was the the overall efficacy was 91.6 and if you look at the different age group very good efficacy throughout all of the groups including the the patients over or subjects over 60 um so it was 91.8 so very very uh similar across across the board uh and this is obviously significantly uh different from the placebo um so it was a it was a statistically significant finding not in all age group um so this is basically the main oh that was what i wanted to so yes so 91.6 now i see what happened okay and then if you remember the graph um and actually i i heard the other day that they're making t-shirts with this graph the teachers i said vaccine work so i'm trying to find one to buy to buy one from me but actually this is this is the same graph that we have seen with modern and pfizer uh in blue are the vaccine recipients in red the placebo and you can see how the number of cases the commutative cases of kobe keep going up in the placebo and it's basically flat in the in the vaccine try one difference with the sputnik and this is something that actually um they actually started counting cases before the second dose so so they actually started counting cases um on day 21 which was the day of the second dose uh as as and that's different from modern advisor that they started counting cases of kobe for efficacy they counted after seven and 14 weeks uh respectively here the the russian group actually started earlier and you can see how how the both curve diverged the safety there were no red flags just to summarize 45 events in the in the vaccine recipients uh 23 um serious adverse event they were basically the same percentage and none of these adverse events were considered associated with with the vaccine there were three deaths exactly three to one ratio three deaths in the vaccine group one death in the in the placebo so exactly the same percentage and they were not considered related to the vaccine they were just events that occurred at random or or not related to the to study participation so so so far we have uh you know if we if we are to trust these results um 91 um efficacy no safety rec flat uh the only thing is small number of subjects in the over 60. uh obviously we need formal approval from regulatory uh authorities to to you know to be able to consider this as such a viable alternative but i can tell you that in latin america in argentina they're used already vaccinating in mexico and some other countries are using or considering the use of this vaccine uh to to curtail the epidemic and the other question and this is a question that you have asked in this in this uh echo and i wanted to trim this this publication really quickly is can a single dose of vaccine be sufficient in patients with kobe uh and it makes sense i mean if you have kobe that your first vaccination should be like a booster for immune system um and the other thing that people frequently ask if i had kobe do i have am i gonna experience more severe adverse events with the vaccine or there's there's already two papers i'm just gonna mention one but there are two papers already addressing these two questions and i'm just going to show you the graph because they are self-explanatory so what they did they took a group of subjects who were seropositive so people who had copied in orange and patients who who did not have kobe and they observe the antibody levels after the first dose so this was the first dose for both the seronegative and zero positive and you can see that the orange dots all over this curve are over the blue dots meaning that definitely the levels of antibody produced in people who already had kobe are higher with the first load so the first dose is actually acting as a as a booster and and and further if you see even after the second dose those who have kobe had a higher uh antibody level than those who did not so definitely if you have coveted your vaccinated you're going to have a very robust immune response even to the first dose so so this opens the door i mean cdc and fda have not recommended a single dose um but opens the door that maybe maybe when they see those results and are analyzed by this regulatory maybe patients with one uh we already have covey may just get one dose uh especially in the in the setting of of short you know supply of vaccine maybe we can do that just give them one and they're probably going to be protected at least for some time we don't know obviously the durability of this immune response but it's it's striking and the second part of the question do they get a more severe reaction the answer is yes from this same study and this was both modern and physical vaccine in some of these subjects these are the reactorgenicity that we are used to see you know the pain the swelling the fatigue you can see almost you know visually that people who had kobe the orange group had a higher frequency of of almost everything so they did it's almost like the second dose for them it's like for us for people who have not have copied and get the second dose they have more reactogenicity for those who are covered have a little bit more reactor unicity with the first dose um so it's you know something that it's so somewhat not surprising and expected but now we see it in a in a polish and there's another identical story with the pfizer only with the pfizer mrna vaccine and the results were very similar so i didn't bring it because it was really really very similar from another group here in the us uh finally for those who i mean this this is more a question for for for people who see patients in the hospital but we we've been asking ourselves if we should use this il-6 inhibitor i have bring some studies and interestingly enough over the last few days there have been two uh large publication or two significant publications um with docilism and interestingly enough one is positive and the other one is completely negative so i think you know we still do not know enough about oscillation i'm just going to briefly mention the studies i'm not going to go into these about the one is the the this is a an adapted uh study similar to the to the recovery uh study or to the one that does the uh the wa show uh it's an international multi-factorial adapter trial and they evaluated the treatment with tosidisou map or sarilu map or standard of care in a group of patients who had been admitted for calling at 24 hours of uh initiating what they call organ support so they were either in oxygen uh high flow nasa cannula non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation this was really really very sick uh individuals and so they they gave uh tulsi to 353 48 received sarilumab which is another il-6 inhibitor um similar to to tosi not identical but similar and 402 were a standard of care and this is what they found they found first of all um they use something slightly different they call support free free days um and and so so the the basically they were able to shorten the support three days by 10 days and 11 days sorry on those with tosi and sarilumab as opposed to zero there were no no improvement in those who did not receive the tosilisku map and you can see the hospital mortality was also numerically different 35 almost 36 these are very sick individuals obviously almost 36 percent mortality versus 22 and 28 um so in this study if you look at this study you look at this resource of tocilius in this severely ill patients is doing something it's helping and the odds ratio were significant statistically significantly better to survive the hospitalization two times and one point six times with either tossy or sorry versus the reference which was standard of care in these different countries but on the other hand just i think uh a few days ago was published in in um in the british medical journal this study from brazil in which they actually uh also used oscillation up the same dose in patients with positive pcr um who were hospitalized that were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation in different places in brazil and actually the dsmb the data safety monitoring board stopped the study because of an increased number of deaths in the tosililisum app so people in the tosidizumab group were dying more than in the control group and the the data safety monitoring more stop the study after 129 so it's a much smaller trial but nevertheless comparing tosi and and standard of care um they actually found um and the groups were rela relatively comparable they were not exactly comparable but they found a 1.5 uh chance of either going into mechanical ventilation or dying if you were treated with dossier and 2.7 so two almost three times higher mortality with the toshili zoom up so here we go one story very bad one story very very good and and in fact um uh the the nih revised its recommendations uh regarding tosi and they they still um they still they said that there's insufficient data to recommend either for or against oscillation in line with this with these two studies which are contradictory i think we need more information uh and better uh decision making and to see who who if anything if if anybody can benefit from from tosilisuma i'm going to leave it there because i already took 30 minutes and we can go to the question question and answer thank you thank you thank you very much for that excellent presentation i'm going to go ahead and move to leslie hayes leslie can you introduce yourself hey leslie hayes family medicine um i actually got my covet shot on friday and i have a railroad spike through my forehead today so i'm really grateful to hear that means i'm having a robust immune response so i'm hoping they come up with something saying i don't need the second one so all right so cobit primary care update um first i was just going to mention um because a couple people i know got these calls this weekend covered vaccine scams people are calling from the claiming to be from the department of health saying we need your social security number and date of birth to verify who you are and then we will get you a copy vaccine because we've got extra so just let your patients know about it i know my daughter who desperately wants one said that she would have given her date of birth and social security number without thinking twice about it so um i let people know that this is happening and then this was a really neat blog post on why israel has succeeded so well at cobot vaccination and one of the reasons i liked it is because a lot of the things that israel is doing new mexico is also doing so israel is vaccinating about one percent of its entire population every day and they've had over 23 percent of the country vaccinated in the first few weeks and they're hoping to have all of the population over 16 vaccinated by the end of march as you can see on this graph they are so far ahead of anyone else as far as vaccine rates i was actually surprised to see that the united states is fifth because i've been not super impressed by our vaccine roll out but apparently we're doing better than an awful lot of places in the world and a few things they focused on simplicity and pragmatism their criteria are very straightforward just healthcare worker they don't distinguish between administration and frontline after healthcare worker then age and then comorbidity what they found was too high a focus on fairness and equity can actually slow down vaccination rate for instance in california they had it separated into how many frontline hours you actually put in and they found that it just got too confusing to calculate because of that vaccines were going to waste the second thing that israel do is doing is they're vaccinating the people who will die there's been some discussion about whether you vaccinate the people who will die which is the people over 70 or you vaccinate the people who are going to spread it which is the 20 and 30 year olds and so israel decided they're going to focus on age and they found that vaccinating 20 to 25 of the country will present 90 prevent 95 of deaths and here's the graph as you can see they've actually got over 70 83 percent between 80 and 89 77 and over 90 80 percent so they're very successful at targeting that age group and new mexico also is i was really surprised governor lujan grisham posted this on her facebook page over the weekend that new mexico has vaccinated 45 percent of new mexicans over age 75 so i thought that was really very exciting so i was very proud of our state um another thing israel has done well is they've created as many endpoints to vaccinate out as possible so if they set up a vaccination program in a hospital every single clinic in the hospital opened a vaccine clinic as well they're using parks schools other public spaces any place you can get vaccinated and then i love this one they're not wasting the vaccine if um there's a vaccine clinic going on you can go ahead and get in line at that clinic and if at 7 pm they haven't given out all their vaccines to people who are in the risk groups they'll just give it to anyone standing in line and if if there isn't anyone standing in line they'll actually have people go out in the street looking for people to vaccinate and i've read enough about vaccines being wasted in clinics in the u.s because they didn't have people in the risk groups to vaccinate um and la has actually started doing this informally um this is a really i i like this article a lot about vaccine chasers who just show up at vaccine clinics and wait to see if there's extra vaccine and have been given it so and then the other thing is success begets success once the pharma company saw that israel was actually giving out all the vaccines they had they prioritize shipments to israel new mexico has done this as well my clinic has done fairly well at giving out vaccines and so we have found the number of vaccines that we've gotten going up every week um meta-analysis a pre-print on long-term effects of covet and this meta-analysis looked at 15 papers involving seven thousand nine hundred and ten patients and they found fifty five different long-term effects of covet nineteen um these papers ranged anywhere from fourteen to a hundred and ten days the study participants were between seventeen and eighty seven and they estimated that eighty percent of the patients that were infected with stars cov2 developed one or more long-term symptoms lasting i think their definition was over 14 days five most common symptoms were fatigue headache attention disorder hair loss and shortness of breath there were a lot of symptoms related to long-term lung disease cough chest discomfort reduced pulmonary diffusion capacity sleep apnea and pulmonary fibrosis also cardiovascular arrhythmias and myocarditis and neurological dementia which i thought was pretty scary depression anxiety attention disorder obsessive compulsive disorders and then some non-specific ones hair loss tinnitus and night sweats and this was just a picture of all of the different possible things you could get in the percentage that it was found in which i thought this was pretty astonishing the number of different symptoms long term from covid and then um there was a really very touching editorial in new england journal by dr raymond givens called one of us and if anyone has not watched the video of dr susan moore she was a black family physician in indianapolis and um she was admitted for covid and eventually ended up dying and she was basically completely ignored it's about uh eight to ten minute video um and it was heartbreaking she was roughly my age and i was admitted earlier this year and i found people just fell over themselves to take care of me when i was in the hospital but instead her symptoms were ignored nobody would treat her and she was sent home way too early and ended up going back in septic a couple days later not septic hypotensive a couple days later dr shanice williams was the chief pediatric resident actually i believe the same hospital in indianapolis and she died of preeclampsia pregnancy-related mortality is unfortunately much much higher for black women and then i think most of us have heard of brianna taylor who was an emergency department technician who died of a botched no knock raid and the editorial just talks about the role racism plays in the increased death rate for black people in the united states and we really feel like medical people should somehow be protected from this but it clearly did not protect any of these three and we all know that covetous deaths have been much much higher in black people which is due to racism on multiple fronts but in particular i think we need to start looking at racism and medicine and make sure that these patients are getting the best of care some additional reading if you want just something that will make you happy read health workers stuck in the snow admin or coronavirus to stranded drivers these folks were transporting the vaccine and there was a car accident and they were going to be stuck for over four hours and the vaccines were going to go bad so they just started knocking on windows and found six people who wanted the vaccine who were very very happy about it and then um there was an article about they're doing anal swabs for beijing residents they found they're more accurate and i posted it mostly because i was very amused to think of doing the driving clinics for that um there's an article about manaus in the washington post and the um uh the variant that's circulating down there and how it's just been so disastrous down there and i saw joanna had asked about um if vaccinated people can still spread covet 19 as far as i know i have not seen any actual data on this but um this was an actual very nice summary of what we do know on whether or not it can spread and the answer's still not definitive but it was a just nice summary of some of what has been done so far and then i realized i read this earlier this summer but i don't think i ever mentioned it if anybody is interested just in viral infections in general and how they get into people um spillover by david clauman was excellent on this and it did contain the line and there's somewhere of you know maybe the next pandemic will you know uh be a coronavirus out of a market in southern china which just was kind of chilling but that is all i have thank you so much leslie really really great information um we do have carissa colbreath and cecilia thompson on the call today i just want to know if you guys either one of you have any any updates but they're both from tricor infectious diseases if not we'll just know that you're there for questions i can't see the review on my screen go ahead no updates here to answer any questions thank you chris likely likely won't be doing um rectal swabs in the drive-throughs anytime soon thanks girls like can you just introduce yourself hey curtis i'm crystal colbreath medical director for infectious disease at tricor and cecilia thompson is here as well medical director infectious disease at tricor excellent thank you so much for being here and we unfortunately don't have our um have marla our department of health person here today she could not be here so so sorry about that um so i think joanna are you ready for me to turn it over to for questions yep i sure am carla go for it okay thanks everybody joanna katzman here um we have a whole lot of very interesting questions for dr sosa dr hayes dr thornton and perhaps others might uh want to chime in too um i think dr hayes actually um has the first question about um dr souza's uh powerpoint presentation today dr haye says have any of the vaccines been tested in brazil nestor yeah i don't know the details but i know yeah barcelo has participated in several trials um probably most of the participation was early like in in the first wave uh or or before these variants were identified in december because we we saw the publication by by pfizer moderna really you know from from data from october and before that so so i i i don't think we have seen a lot of data from from the new variants in brazil and related to the vaccine to be honest but yeah some of the older uh strains were tested there or some of the older the vaccines were tested on the older strains not on the new strains or variants thanks nestor and could i just get clarification about the sputnik vaccine in russia is this the vaccine that was uh was uh was put out many many months ago was this the vaccine that russia started you know back in last spring yes yes it is it is uh they actually started using it in in you know limited amount of the population uh before the phase three uh and also argentina i can tell you because i have another echo in that i do with latin america and i know the uh argentina started vaccinating you know a few weeks ago with the spanish spoken vaccine and i think mexico has also received a donation and and even panama the country where i'm from it's also considering buying a few million doses of sputnik so yes it is the same it's it's from the gamalia institute is the name of the institute over there and it's known as the you know the gamalia vaccine or the russian vaccine or the sputnik 5 vaccine thanks um thank you uh uh dr saltman dan do you want to unmute and ask your question yes uh sure thank you thank you uh uh everyone for your excellent work uh my question was about what happens to the adenovirus vehicle in the vaccine that once the antigen that it's carrying is introduced uh what happens to the adeno the remaining adenovirus and we i know that adenoviruses and other viruses can be found incorporated into human genomes from history from ancient history so i was just wondering what happens to those to those adenoviruses right i can make i make i mean i'm not an expert obviously on these that's really really very uh detailed um things but i know first of all these adenovirus are non-replicative so they do not uh copy themselves so you're not going to have a you're not supposed to have an adenovirus infection it's just a sort of a vehicle to penetrate the cells so they do attach to the receptor penetrate the cells the muscle cells or the dendritic cells and what they have is not really the anti and they have dna because these are dna viruses they have dna for the spike protein so they have a so this dna is translated into mrna and then into spike protein and then the spy protein goes through the process of anti impersonation etc but i i mean i guess it should be destroyed relatively rapid because it's not replicated uh probably destroyed within the cells that are infected with these non-replicative viruses but what what do happens is that if you have pre-existing immunity and this is the concern with the adenovirus vaccine if you had adenovirus 26 let's say you know three months ago and you have immunity against it you probably your immune system is going to attack this virus before it gets into the muscle cells before it can replicate the dna so that's probably why people are so somewhat concerned and maybe what we're seeing a slight decrease in the efficacy if you compare with the mrnas that do not use a vector because there's you know nobody has immunity against mrna but we do have immunity against adenovirus and that's the reason why astral seneca uses a chimpanzee and the reason why the russians use two different one because if you are immune to one of them just by chance hopefully you're not immune to the other one so one of the two are going to do the trick of of producing the spike protein thanks nestor so much great question dan um deborah do you want to unmute and ask your question about the kramer study dr mcgrew yes thank you yeah i was just wondering in that study the people who had been who had tested positive for covet who had had covet approximately how long had the time been uh when they had actually had the disease to the to the test was there any information on that thank you no not that i don't know i think uh no i think they went i have to review in detail the paper again but they just i mean they tested for serology so i don't think they they actually quantify the time but i have to review i think they just did a test and if you are positive you're going to the seropositive the orange dots and if you were negative you're certainly i don't think they i specifically asked uh you know how long have has been since you have copied in all of the participants but i have to go back and verify that but i think it was just are you sir positive or not that was sort of uh the question before the the analysis great uh thank you dr murray thanks dr sosa um fred fox asked a question about are these neutralizing or non-neutralizing and i think uh fred i think you might be referring to the response from the people um who had coveted and then uh got the vaccine in this kramer study am i right dr fox if you want one yes that's correct thank you okay yes nestor do you know um if these were neutralizing antibiotics yeah this this was very short article and i think they just use antibodies against the the spy protein they i i don't remember they're looking into neutralization just just antibodies against the rbd or the spike protein in general um and it was actually one page one page short communication great great thank you uh peggy spencer s uh but people who have covered still are recommended to get two vaccines and i'm almost positive that's correct absolutely um i guess and i have i had a question nestor it's um about uh you know is there any new data out on whether or not if you've had a vaccine whether it's the pfizer modern or any of the others um your ability to transmit covid um or is has there been any data for those that have been fully vaccinated with two with two of the back you know two doses um have there been any cases of people still getting coded yeah i um let me see if i can summarize i mean we don't have like a like a definitive conclusion there there's there are some uh pre-print articles which are starting to show um things which i i think are pointing the right direction though i just i haven't reviewed it but i just got the the uh a text from uh from a pre print in which they mentioned decreased viral loading those who were infected despite vaccination so those few that that get copied after the the physical vaccine they actually analyze that small group of patients and they measure their the amount of virus in the in their respiratory secretions and seems to be like fourfold less than those who who um who were not vaccinated and have a regular infection so i think we are and i'm really optimistic in that sense that we are going to show except for the new virus at least for the old variants that 94 95 efficacy is going to translate also into less infectiousness just that we don't want to jump ahead and and you know tell everybody throw your mask away you know go back to bars and parties because we don't know really we don't have the data but i think slowly we're going to be this this subgroup analysis of of patients from the large uh physical modern astrocenic et cetera trials in which they actually look at an asymptomatic infection or viral load in those who are infected despite the vaccination um and and i think it's going to be better but we have to wait i mean i probably going to bring that that article in the next update to see the details of of that fourfold decrease in the buyer loading those who who uh were copied positive despite being vaccinated which is good it's good news they were infected but we know now that they they don't get severe disease and hopefully they will they will not get uh high viral loads necessary for transmission or at least for to be a super spreader or something along those languages which is is good in in an epidemiological you know setting it's fantastic news really great um sarah davis has uh the next question about um it just seems like the new variants from south america from great britain uh from uh south africa seems as though they you know came all about the same time and she's wondering if this is really was chance or was it just a surveillance artifact that people started checking what are your thoughts yeah um well several things i i think um this evolution now we're learning and i i've seen a couple of papers which actually points to the fact that if you press the virus if you put pressure selective pressure on the barrier some some mutations are gonna are gonna appear in different geographic areas and simultaneously especially mutations in the rbd which is the the the area of the of the spike protein that that attaches to the h2 um so if if you have either you know enough people infected with uh with antibodies putting pressure on the virus or you start using monoclonals or you start vaccinating people um those mutations are gonna show up almost as a normal phenomenon of natural selection and there's experimental evidence i was actually listening to a podcast of some of the research from the rockefeller foundation in which they actually in in vitro if you put a virus and you expose them to convalescent serum in certain concentration they are able to induce this for instance the e4 a4k mutation which is the one that it's in south africa and it's so worrisome and the one that is in brazil one of the mutations that those two viruses are if this uh specific mutation in the in the area of the rbd uh which is the the area where the most neutralizing the most powerful antibodies actually attach so i think yeah i mean it's it's it's possible that they people have trouble and exchange these variants but it's also possible that they may have appear spontaneously because of a lot of viral circulation a lot of people with antibodies um and in some cases like in the united states uh patients will be treated with monoclonals or are immunosuppressed and they have like a you know viral evolution within them like quasi species inside an suppressed patient which was actually recently reported in new england journal um so so yeah so i think it's just a matter of putting enough pressure on the virus and we're going to see these sort of commonalities in the different variants um in in in in the in the spider and there are other mutations in other parts of the virus that are also you know appearing but obviously we're putting more attention to the to the spike protein because it's the sort of the most important immunologically uh area of the body but there are also mutations in the nuclear protein and other areas that are are showing up there is an interesting one dr hayes sorry this leslie there's an interesting article on npr this weekend about a man with severe immunodeficiency who tested positive recovery for five months and they were saying they were comparing patients like this around the world and all of them were developing mutations at kind of the same rate um and that sort of explained um a little bit how that happened so thanks leslie carissa do you have any comments about um you know the the new variants coming out and why that might be yeah i think um nestor some summed it up um exactly correctly great thank you um i'm gonna ask one more question and turn it over to uh turn it over to carla here um i think uh let me see john foster says um they're they're they're doing over a thousand vaccines a day in taos they haven't lost a single dose um lynn colemeyer asks any data on concerns for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use reducing the covent response if taking if taken within a few days of vaccine and there's been a number of questions about that in today's chat uh yesterday sorry can you repeat the question again sorry i was reading some of the questions in the chat and got distracted i'm sorry you know for folks taking um you know a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug either right before or a couple days before perhaps uh reducing the immune response of the vaccine right yeah i haven't seen any like papers uh i have seen like opinions of experts on on different settings in which in which they they actually made a comment that ideally you should not take anything unless you were like really symptomatic because at least there's this theoretical concern that if you take uh non-steroidal or prednisone or or even antihistamine you you can in some way affect your immune response i don't think i've seen any any solid data about that maybe when we're now that we're vaccinating people if somebody's doing like a retrospective review you know to see the immune response and those who took or didn't take uh uh non-steroidal we can see some data but but yeah i mean that it's common sense that if it doesn't sound like a good idea to pre-medicate you you know with a lot of things if you're going to get a vaccine because you want to have a good immune response sort of a you know pure immune response if you if you like but i i mean i don't think an ibuprofen will knock down the immune system because we would you know be able to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis with a couple of ibuprofen and that's that's not the case uh but but you know it makes sense to be over medicated thanks thanks back to you carla thank you so it's interesting nestor i mean it does say in the um in the rec in the cdc you know to consider not taking nonsteroidals or whatever but it's it's something that at least in my experience we didn't talk about a lot with any other vaccine telling people not to give themselves a tylenol or not a tylenol but non-steroidal anti-inflammatory that's very interesting yeah i have a confession to make i took uh 400 milligrams of survival profit with my second dose because i felt like you know i wasn't the same i felt so really didn't have a fever but i wanted to feel better so i took my i took the chance and and went against the cdc recommendation that's funny um there there's a question about the from pam weissman about does one dose of the pfizer or the modern vaccine prevents severe disease or is hospitalization i'm not sure if that's known but do you can you and no i don't i don't think we have the data i mean they they look at like this short period between the first and the second those and they have some numbers of decrease uh or vaccine protection which it goes from 50 to 70 percent um we just won those but it was just such a source follow-up i mean they they got the vaccine day 21 for pfizer the 2084 modern so we don't know you know if that that um would have protected them for you know three months or two months we don't really know the durability of a of a single those there's definitely some degree of protection uh but we also know that a second dose gives you a booster a much higher immune response so that that's all we have um regarding knowledge so i don't think they look at severe disease with such a small number of cases i would have to go back to the report that they presented to the fda to see there was a difference in severe disease in that short period of follow-up thank you and then um there's a question about i i don't know again if we have this data but has there been any doubt on how many people who've been fully vaccinated went on to get infected with coca-19 is there any discussion you know i mean we we know that from the studies there was this five percent uh if you look at the efficacy the other way around is a five percent failure rate of the vaccine so so there was a five to six percent in the in the trials in the modern advisor i don't know if we're looking probably groups are looking at the real life the the not the efficacy but the effectiveness of the vaccine in the real life so we're probably going to see some of that i have seen data from israel uh like in in pre preprint in which they are starting to publish the decrease in the hospitalization and cases in in the age group that they have started vaccinating and have heard the number of as high as 50 percent right off the bat decrease in the cases with just a few weeks of vaccination but i haven't seen anything published on on like the us experience for instance to see um you know what the real life uh decreasing cases or how many people are actually developing copied after uh the two doses of the vaccine i haven't seen any any solid data on that great thank you um the another question about specifically about what you discussed this this um earlier on nestor is that were sterile were steroids used concurrently in both of the toastalismab studies that you talked about yeah in the in the first story in their remak uh cap study there was a high percentage of steroid use um in the brazilian it was smaller uh the percentage of patient but yeah there were there was some some steroid use in some of these patients and any and even sombra and deserve in some so this is tosilisumab on top of standard of care which depending on the hospital et cetera um included steroids and and rendezvous and some other treatments that were used especially early on um in in the in the pandemic so yeah so this is sort of an add-on um and in fact here at unm we have a therapeutic committee and we are um discussing you know where to place uh tosilisima because if you look at the positive study you say maybe we should use it uh but then there there's also this like uh negative or or or neutral studies in which show no no advantage and it's not a inexpensive drug and and it's an immunosuppressant also so so they have been associated with infections when it's used in in other settings like like uh in rheumatologic patients so so or other patients with cytokine storm so so it's it's kind of you know difficult to make the decision in which patient to use it based on the data at this point and it is reflected by the nih the nih didn't commit themselves and the ibsa have not updated the tosilisumab sentence since november so we're waiting for them also to to sort of emit some judgment regarding tosi uh based on these new studies that have been published and that being the the impact uh this one the remap and and the brazilian um recently and we don't know we haven't heard from all them thank you very much um i just wanted to let everybody know that the uh cme link went into the chat at about 12 45 and if you uh we'd love to hear your feedback and if you'd like to see me for this session please fill that out thank you um uh dr yehuda pat was asking about the what do you know anything about the use of anti-cd4 for inhibiting cytokine storm as reported by nader arbor from israel have you do you know anything about that nestor no i just i saw actually my wife was actually here and she's a physician actually told me something about that last night she said you you have to read this apparently they're using like a noble exosome uh therapy which i have no idea what it is um but they're using sort of an experimental and they did a phase one and they found in very small number of subjects i think was 20 or 25 subjects and they used this exosome combined with cd24 and they found some positive results obviously this is very small trial phase one no control group so we need to wait for more if you see the headline it's like israel found the cure for kobe but in reality when you look at the the news uh it's it's just that they did a phase one with an experimental drug um that look you know at least look promising in that phrase 125 patient we have to really wait for the phase two or three and and see if if it works and in which type of patient early you know patient with symptoms as a prophylaxis as therapy uh there's a lot of questions but yeah i saw the headline of the of the article and what we have to wait for more um and i think the same thing happened just a couple of weeks with the culture scene if you remember there was this headline that coach is in decreases mortality by you know 30 or something and when you look at the details it was really like from six to four percent something like that uh so it was really not not that impressive when you look at the paper it's it's sort of um different to what the headline in the in the newspaper or in the in the news outlet um transmit yeah thank you dr pat oh there is did you have a comment dr pat i see that you unmuted yourself all it did was actually decrease the um the uh storm the cytokine storm yeah thank you thank you for that interesting question um let's see uh melvina mccabe asked leslie if you have any data on covet 19 racism and american indian or alaska native populations and is there care also compromised or have you seen anything on that i have definitely seen something that here is compromised for all people of color in the us i don't have specific data on native americans and it's not just that it's compromised at the level when they come in with cobit i mean it's compromised before that people you know may have been treated poorly in a doctor's office when they went in for primary care and because of that they didn't get their diabetes or their kidney disease diagnosed early enough and you know they may go in too late um with their cobit because they're scared of how they've been treated in the past so it's multiple levels and it's it's definitely an issue for all people of color yeah thank you leslie um there's a question from stuart miller is there a commercially available test available to obtain an igg spike protein antibody tighter level or other appropriate antibody tighter level and is there a known cut off antibody tighter level that offers adequate protection like carissa i think you yeah go ahead krista yeah i can jump in there um let's see i think it would be yes yes no we don't know i think that was the right order of the answers um but yes there are commercially available antibody tests that can detect a spike protein but that's not universal for all antibody tests and i don't think most antibody tests that it's actually reported in the patient report whether or not what the target of the antibody is so if there's a question you should certainly reach out to the laboratory and call and ask the lab specifically is this is this test to detect spike protein the challenge though is that i don't think we have really good data on what it means as to whether or not there's good responses to spike protein and both natural infection nor do we know titers that are appropriate for immunity following vaccine so you know you could maybe make some you know possibly make some distinction if there's an antibody test that only detects spike protein compared to an antibody test that um detected spike and nucleocapsid to differentiate natural infection versus antibody response but we just don't have enough data right now to really support that as an activity nor do we know the titers that help to support immunity great thank you so much carissa back to you joanna hey thanks carla um just want to comment from elaine strother's chat she said south korea started testing cats and dogs and um is wanting to know if there's any comments on spillover for pets i guess vice versa if there's if if pets have been known to contract covet and give it to humans or vice versa we know there's theories about it starting from the bad in ch in wuhan but have you heard anything more about domestic animals here in the u.s nestor no no not really but it's it's probably worthwhile using this question to you know just to discuss i mean there are several mammals that are affected by kobe we know the weasel and the family of weasels the the um there are several of them that that have been used in the laboratory and that have been infected like the minks farms in denmark and in other places so they are susceptibility there's also susceptibility among felines so they have been like large felines like lions and tigers affected with with uh with kobe 19 and obviously domestic cats can also in theory become infected um but i i don't know you know more than that i don't know if there's already like a diagnostic test if you take your your cat to the to the bed if they can do a test i honestly don't know their commercially available test for for for animals either for for antigen or or pcr or serology um but it's been a concern from the beginning of the pandemic that our animals can can contract the disease especially cats and and obviously i think a few reports of dogs also um and and those type of things and i think early on um the who kind of released pets as a pet to human transmission risk but still if the pet does test positive to keep the pet away from potential household contacts as well as from other pets so unlikely that the pet can transmit to other humans thanks carissa all very interesting and then we have the case of uh the coveted sniffing dogs in in florida with the basketball or football team whatever that may be not sure if they're sniffing covet or sniffing people who might be have a high temperature or what but that seems very unusual nestor do you know how that might work well i i don't know specifically about florida but i read the paper from i think it was frankfurt from a group in germany and what they what supposedly that the animals detect is volatile uh organic compounds in in patients who have copied apparently there are some compounds that are produced so they can smell the respiratory secretions of these individuals and and actually you know bark or whatever when they smell somebody who smells like kobe but it's it's amazing one way or the other it's amazing that that those little animals can do that and we struggle with with uh the diagnosis with sophisticated technologies and they can smell the a patient but it's it's amazing it's been done with other diseases i know cancer and other and other diseases can be diagnosed by dogs also so it's really amazing their ability to detect this boc their volatile organic compounds presumably in the in the secretions of people who are who have the disease right right absolutely um i think i'd like to want to see if dr cooper joanna cooper could have mute and ask your question about post covert care because i i do believe unm is still ha still has the a post covent clinic um but i i believe good afternoon everyone um i guess you know i'm at zuni ihs and while we still have active cases uh seems like a lot of what we're doing now are seeing people who had covet at some point in the last you know eight or nine months and they're left with a whole you know spectrum of symptoms and i'm just wondering you know you guys are our referring hospital or one of our referring hospitals so i'm just wondering if there's anything that you can offer in terms of you know what we should do with these folks who are not just with a headache but you know with ongoing pulmonary issues or cardiac issues um so that that was the gist of my question mass journey yeah yeah no unfortunately i can't i mean i'm more in the impatient i know we have uh dr alicia parada who's running the the outpatient kobe clinic and they do have you know patient that they're following that have been discharged patient that that have participated in clinical trials so they are sort of building up uh you know a database there with with those patients but i don't i don't really know personally you know what type of protocols are following uh what type of treatment or diagnostic testing algorithm they're following i i don't know uh uh for a fact maybe we can invite alicia in the future to come and and stop by and discuss i know there's efforts also from project echoing of carla uh thinking about this problem and how we can help from from project echo this specific issue of of of long covey that's a great idea mr maybe we can definitely have alicia carla do you want to comment on any of that um yeah i know we should definitely have alicia she came to critical care last week and it was really really super helpful and they're they're definitely doing a lot of follow-up and they're also designing some research protocols to follow people and and really try to figure all of this out so she'd be a great person to come here and as nestor mentioned this is very early stages but trying to figure out how to use the echo learning platform to to address postcovid not just covet which is what we do here but all of the postcode issues as well right a couple things i have seen recommended if they have um chest pain shortness of breath any of those they recommend getting ekg echo and chest x-ray and then it does seem reasonable to be screening for kidney liver disease and diabetes down the road because of the high incidence of those in especially folks who have been hospitalized so thank you leslie well we have a minute uh about a minute left everyone and wanted to thank you for all coming on we do have a whole host of questions that we didn't get to today and i'm i'm going to try to see if we can bank these and save them until uh next week uh so stay tuned we'll we're gonna try to get to your uh fantastic questions i wanna remind everybody that today at two o'clock mountain time we have our first responder echo first responder resiliency echo that meets every week um the topic today is how to get off uh the drama triangle gain personal freedom and eliminate unnecessary uh work stress um and and home stress it's by a fantastic psychologist at in california who works with first responders traditional first responders and those um on the front lines also um we are starting a climate change in human health echo a week from wednesday february 17th and many of you who get the weekly digest might have opportunity to browse through that flyer you can participate in one or any of the eight sessions that are part of that series and i do believe that um the critical care echo is a week from thursday carla is that right yep critical care echo is not this thursday but a week from thursday and um i think that's it uh so um remember to get your get your cme before you leave and we'll see you all next week stay safe and thank you so much for being part of this program,,2/8/2021
37,good morning everybody can you hear me great okay uh welcome it's february 15th my name is joanna katzman welcome to our new mexico office hours infectious disease echo um i i'm a neurologist if you um if you are on video fantastic uh please do mute your please do mute your phone or video if you can fantastic um i would like to introduce my colleague dr carla thornton if she is on hi good afternoon everyone karla thornton here i'm an infectious disease physician at unm and one of the associate directors of project echo welcome today fantastic um and yeah just wanted to remind everybody that if you um are do have a video and don't have it turned on please turn that on as we love to really see everybody's faces and it's certainly just fine to be able to eat and drink as many of you this is your lunch hour i wanted to give you a quick um some quick housekeeping items uh dr i mean kent noseworthy is our digital librarian he's going to be copying and pasting a lot of evidence-based evidence guided material into the chat please feel free and get that information and use that as you as you wish 45 minutes after the hour you'll be receiving the cme link and you can obtain your no costs ceu cme credits and if you don't need that please uh consider just filling out that as we do take a lot of time to look over this information and try to improve the program i wanted to now turn it over i'm going to make introductions for our subject matter experts as we go along uh first i'd like to introduce marla sivers from the new mexico department of health marla's an epidemiologist and she's going to begin today's session marla thanks so much joanna nice to see everyone today um i actually have a powerpoint today which i don't normally but i had a lot i wanted to update on and so it was mostly just to keep myself organized uh next slide please so a few things that i wanted to update the group on one being the federal pharmacy program expansion and this has been in the media a lot so people may have heard about it and just wanted to let you know what was happening here in new mexico so there is an additional elementation of about a million doses that will be going out nationally from hhs of vaccine and this will be allocated to states based on population and this really expands the retail pharmacy component of vaccine distribution so additional supplies so this is above the allocation that the state is currently receiving will be shipped to 21 national retail pharmacy networks and as supply increases that should expand to include over 40 000 retail pharmacy locations around the country so the goal of this is to create some additional distribution points so that we have really dispersed access to vaccines and we don't create bottlenecks by having um constrained distribution points the state guidelines for who's eligible to receive vaccines still apply so even though this is an additional allocation that's going to a retail pharmacy each state's guidelines for eligibility still apply the new mexico department of health has included retail pharmacies in our distribution network um since the beginning of our vaccine rollout so we have sent some of our state allocation out to retail pharmacies around the state to increase access especially in rural communities currently the federal pharmacy partner for new mexico is walgreens they're the only pharmacy chain that's currently signed up in new mexico for this additional vaccine distribution but hopefully we'll have more coming online and then the second part of this uh federal pharmacy expansion involves federally federally qualified health centers and so initially this week there will be additional supplies so again this is above and beyond what a state is already receiving from hhs shipped to federally qualified health centers this is going to start out uh pretty targeted it's a small roll out to only 25 fqhcs across the country and when i looked at the prioritization of that they're really trying to reach um it looks like fqhcs who are serving uh migrant worker populations uh people experiencing homelessness and other particularly hard to reach groups who may have been underserved up to this point so as the supply increases this is going to expand to 250 fqhcs around the country again the idea is that you're creating these additional accessible distribution points state guidelines for eligibility will still apply currently there are no new mexico fqhcs that are among these initial 25 sites where this initial rollout this week of 25 sites does not include any new mexico fqhcs unknown if we will be included in that next wave of 250 i'll keep you guys updated um but important to note that again department of health already includes fqhcs in its distribution network so using the existing supplies that are coming to into our state we've already engaged our fqhc partners for vaccination in these high-risk populations so moving on cdc released some new guidance this week regarding quarantine after exposure in people who are fully vaccinated so the first important point is that people who are vaccinated should still continue to follow all the current guidance to protect themselves and others so they should still be wearing masks distancing avoiding crowded spaces washing your hands often so none of that changes just because a person has received one or two vote doses in the vaccine series um however there was a change that vaccinated persons who are exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed copied so remember that normally we would tell that person they need to quarantine for 14 days if they're fully vaccinated so more than two weeks after the receipt of their second dose in the two dose series and are within three months of having received that last dose in their vaccine serious theories and have no symptoms they don't need the quarantine and um this was a little bit confusing when this guidance was released because to me saying within three months uh seemed to suggest that uh they think vaccine immunity only lasts three months and so there was a lot of conversation about this at a cdc call on saturday actually and um you know what they clarified is that this was sort of an interim step to align this uh no need for quarantine guidance with people who um are within three months of natural infection so it's not meant to imply that they think vaccine immunity only lasts three months um and there will be you know further information coming out about uh quarantine guidance for people who are fully vaccinated as more data comes in and can be evaluated about how the vaccine is performing in real world conditions and about its effectiveness of course against these variants of concern so if a person doesn't meet these three criteria so a person who is exposed for example who may become symptomatic they should quarantine so you need to meet all three of these criteria to be exempt from quarantine and there's an important exception to this people who are hospital inpatients who have been exposed should continue to quarantine and residents and long-term care facilities should continue to quarantine after a known exposure and that's just recognizing that increased risk of exposure to other people should that person develop illness um so no change to the isolation guidance for confirmed cases so this really re is only in regard to quarantine for people who are exposed to a case if you are a confirmed case you have a positive viral test for sars cov2 no changes to the isolation guidance you would still need to isolate regardless of your vaccination status and then i wanted to announce uh we've begun cdc and at the state level our copa vaccine breakthrough surveillance so obviously um you know we are very interested in people who are fully vaccinated so two weeks past their uh second dose in the series who go on to develop infection so we want to know about those cases as quickly as possible so that we can obtain their isolates from the laboratory for a full genome sequencing because part of what we'll be looking at is you know is this a variant infection and that explains the vaccine breakthrough or um you know are there certain uh groups um you know age ranges or other demographic groups um which are disproportionately represented in vaccine breakthroughs so that'll be important for us understanding um the efficacy of vaccine in real world conditions and also to try to answer this question about you know does vaccine just prevent symptomatic disease or does it also uh prevent infections so if providers become aware of one of these breakthrough cases we want to know right away there is a han that's being drafted that will uh be out and um with further instructions about how you notify department of health and help us obtain those laboratory specimens next line then i wanted to update the group this pertains to the case presentation uh that dan smith from new mexico behavioral health institute presented a couple of weeks ago uh with the woman with the delayed hypersensitivity reaction there was some discussion a couple weeks ago um i think or last week at the acip fda meeting about these delayed hypersensitivity reactions these were observed during the moderna trials and you can see some people had a delayed injection site reactions on or after day eight is what they're defining as delayed and so less than one percent of participants in the trials experienced this you know after their first and second dose and the reactions were typically erythema and duration tenderness and they resolved over the following four to five days so this was a phenomenon that was observed during the clinical trials and cdc updated their guidance this week to include some direction for people who might experience one of these delayed hypersensitivity reactions after their first vaccine so uh ultimately they don't think that this is a contraindication to receiving your second dose the recommendation is still that those folks would receive their second dose however it should be administered in the opposite arm i mean you can read more about that i've included the link here i won't spend a lot of time of it on it just because of time um and then lastly we've updated the new hovid vaccination dashboard i know some people were interested in more county level data so you can now look at the map and you can look at county level data and this is by the person's county of residence and there's also some tables and graphs that show you age group stratification for who has received vaccine the dashboard now also includes vaccines administered from federal partners like the va ihs or federal bureau of prisons and again i've included the link there thanks everyone this is joanna marla this is just terrific amazing amazing information thank you so much um for those of us here uh kind of physically in new mexico this is fantastic information and for those of us for those of you residing outside side of new mexico uh marla where might um are the clinicians on the network that are outside of new mexico be able to get information regarding um you know pharmacy distribution um and such so if you go and i think can already put it in the chat there's the link to the federal pharmacy partnership program if you go there you can search by your state and you can see who the retail pharmacy partners are in your state and also find information about fdh's in your state who may be receiving this additional distribution of vaccine great thank you marla so much and we have a lot of fantastic questions already coming in to the chat and so keep them flowing um while i introduce nestor sosa our uh our chief um who is the division chief of the infectious disease group at university of new mexico school of medicine um and uh nestor has his powerpoint about just about ready yes thank you thank you joanna thank you marla let me put this in the larger okay so too hard can you all see my slides okay perfect i have a lot of things to share so i'm gonna go go fast so we can allow time for for question and answer for some reason i i found so many interesting uh preprints this week so first of all most of these articles are in the pre preprint or or or before peer review so i just wanted to put this disclaimer because sometimes the articles change when they are finally published in the in the in the papers in the not in the papers in the journals so these are what i'm going to talk i'm going to talk about uh my recent publication from new mexico actually on on the 677 mutation a new eua for a for a monoclonal cocktail um a study uh a reinfection from qatar that was sent uh by dr miller stuart miller here in our in our group um some data on vaccine effect effectiveness now not efficacy but actually affecting in israel uh a new result from the recovery trial on tosilisiumab uh the first evidence of decreased viral load after vaccination something about the interval between doses and um the last the latest hope for a miracle cure i just want to share some results on another drug so first of all i just want to congratulate the group that we have last week daryl darrow and dr edwards dario dunman darden being withy and and were actually featured in the new york times i think yesterday um because they published their their experience with the varian the 677 mutation that they found here and actually they did it with some collaborators in louisiana and other places so they already put out the the and the lines here are moved but they already put put out the the preprint uh is the emergence in the late 2020 of multiple lineages of sarcobytes white protein variants and with a mutation at position 6 77 which is in one of the critical areas of the spike protein and this paper has daryl kurt schwann michael edwards and daryl dean within that we had last week here um basically they described how the these mutations in the position six 677 have been increasing in the united uh st in the in the in the genomic sequencing and it actually appear in different areas um uh simultaneously with some differences so the the there is that this is just showing up in different places probably offers some type of advantage to the virus because it's sort of a what it's called a convergence evolution because it appears in in different places uh without a clear relationship between the patients uh so stay tuned for these and they actually i found this very uh actually poetic or or nice instead of coming with all these complicated numbers they actually name the different uh viruses or lineages of viruses with the names of burps uh to be easier to remember so the one from new mexico is rowing one um but there's another robin two that was isolated in other places pelican in oregon et cetera so so they're they're tracking seven changes in the virus and they actually uh these different lineages they they gave at least easy to remember names so really nice uh imagination there but this is very complicated basic science uh you know genomic studies so hopefully we'll have them back in the future to explain in more detail the other sort of news is that the fda gave an eoa to the combination of bangla map and at the sevimap which are two monoclonals for mild to moderate kobe in patients who are a high risk of progression progression so you know age over 65 or over 55 with some risk factors can now receive or or you know are authorized to receive uh this combination which um it's more effective than than ban la nimima uh um uh by itself so so it's the the the efficacy preventing hospitalization in these uh mild to moderate ecobee was was statistically significant and different from just ban language monotherapy so it's sort of a step forward obviously the the eua says that that cb maps should be used only with mandani map and it's not for hospitalized patients so it's very similar to the bandlandima recommendation just that it's a combination of two monoclonal antibodies again the the spike protein dr miller sent me uh sent us this this article so i i'm gonna review briefly i call it the mother of all reinfection studies this is a group in qatar which actually uh follow forty thousand patients uh with a copy uh to see if they got reinfected essentially so they they this is a cohort study out of qatar it's called sars copyright infection in a cohort of 43 thousand antibody positive individuals so they had this population of people who already had a positive antibody so evidence of all infection and they followed them for 16 weeks to see if they got reinfected and using different criteria just just having a positive pcr 14 days after the initial diagnosis with antibody they found 0.7 but if if they apply the genomic evidence so actually doing genetic sequencing of the of the two viruses the one that was isolated in the beginning the first time and the second episode they found only 0.1 uh frequency of of reinfection so very low even lower than what we have seen in the in the uk and this gives sort of uh an incidence of 0.66 by 10 000 person weeks so definitely very low and another thing is that they they said that this protection didn't wane at least over seven months which has the the observation period um and there was only one severe case so most of these cases that occur like 129 cases were all mild so so if you have copy once you're at least you're relatively protected and actually they the protection for infection is 95.2 which remind me of the protection of the physical vaccine so so if you got copied you have a protection at least for a few months and if this we saw in the in two studies from the uk but now this one from qatar of 95 unless you have some type of immunodeficiency etc but these are just general uh population in qatar the other uh the other important i think news also from the middle east as you know israel is the country with the highest percentage of vaccination they i think last time i checked they were over 40 percent of the other population vaccinated and one of the areas actually published um or actually communicated that that out of almost half a million vaccinated people only four have had severe kobe uh and none of them died so so uh you know this sort of confirms the finding of the study and this was mostly with the pfizer vaccine zero death and very rare four in half a million uh cases of coveting the vaccinated subjects so so hopefully the the surveillance that we're going to do here in new mexico is going to show the same um um but i think it's this type of study are important and in fact they actually and this is after two doses full vaccination 14 days after the second dose but they actually publish a pre print of an earlier experience they actually uh showed that there was a decrease of around 50 in the in the risk of developing disease after the first dose after 13 to 24 days after the first dose so very early even with one dose you start seeing protection and this is real life real world evidence from israel so so really encouraging news regarding so a 51 relative risk reduction so that's what the triple r means in the uh 13 to 14 days after the first dose um in in in this population obviously much better after the second dose but this was the earlier earlier publication with the pfizer vaccine there in israel the other study if you remember the the recovery story was famous because it was the one that gave us the the first evidence on on dexamethasone this uh like a real life study done in many places in the uk uh it's sort of an adaptive trial not double line placebo but actually open label and and this time they they they actually send the pre-publication of this uh story using tosylisiomaptosilicima uh we have discussed before it's an il-6 receptor inhibitor that is supposed to to fight this uh cytokine storm uh that patients with severe kobe uh developed so they did this this study the toshilisma they actually included adult patients with kobe 19 obviously with positive pcr and they have to have pneumonia so they have hypoxia defined as less than 92 percent uh saturation in room air and systemic inflammation uh defined by a crp greater than 75 these were sick individual patients who are hospitalized with hypoxia and kobe and they gave him either 400 or 800 milligrams depending on the body weight and these those could be repeated and they compare that with the standard of care see there's no placebo this is not a double line placebo control it's actually they compare against uh not receiving tossily sumac and the great majority of this patient receives terror so this is stereos on top of i'm sorry tossily sumaf constaple steroid and what they look was the 28 day mortality they enroll patients mostly you know throughout last year's epidemic in the uk and the the number of subjects is pretty large four thousand subjects half in the tosilisma half in the um in the standard of care and you can see how sick they were 14 were wearing mechanical ventilation 41 were receiving non-invasive ventilation and 45 on the oxygen so this was really sick patients and they found a statistically significant decrease in the 28-day mortality from 33 usual care went down to 29 which is sort of a 14 relative risk reduction so a relative risk of 0.86 um not unlike we saw with with dexamethasone so um so interesting finding there was also more chances or higher likelihood of being discharged alive in 28 days and also less progression to mechanical ventilation so this is another positive study for tosillus map the the 28th immortality kaplan mayor and the 20-day hospital discharge both favor uh tussily suma clearly and when you put that into all of the other studies um you know there are some studies we didn't show so they actually all over the place the study that have been done with oscillation map this one because it's positive the recovery but puts the final tally um favor into solid map so we'll we have to see if the nih and cdc uh decide on on these now with this large 4 000 subject story uh from the uk uh but you can see that some of the other studies really have no benefit they crossed the one um except for the the rima cap that i presented i think last week and now this other uh trial uh from from the uk so interesting we we keep learning about tosca lisuma we have have to wait a couple of comments on vaccines uh you know one of the probably hardest questions at this point is do vaccines decrease transmission uh and and and also uh if if my second dose doesn't get here on time am i gonna die so a couple of papers relating to this question so this is the first evidence that the there's a decreased viral law following vaccination these uh investigators actually compare um the viral load of those who these are vaccinated people who develop kobe um shortly after the the vaccination so this meaning that they were probably um incubating the disease when they were vaccinated with one dose and then viral load uh after the second week week of the first dose okay and remember the ct it's in there's an inverse relation between the ct in the pcr and the wire load so this this is comparing the pcr ct or cyclic threshold um in these two groups those who develop a copy like really early so before the vaccine had any effect and and after um a couple of weeks of of the first dose and you can see that the ct is higher meaning that the viral load of those vaccinated was lower and is the the headline of this this study so patients who receive the vaccine and and nevertheless develop disease there's probably a lower bilateral and that hopefully will translate hopefully because we don't have any direct proof will translate into less uh transmission and this is only one dose really early so we'll have to wait two doses two weeks after to see if we if this is replicated i'm sure it's gonna to be that way but we have to also see the data but this is early data of of how the vaccine can decrease viral load even if you get infected okay so that's that's interesting and they also compare with uh viral load of vaccinator versus unvaccinated uh comparators and there's definitely um several points in the city higher for those vaccinated meaning lower viral loading those vaccinated than than unvaccinated patients with kobe so interesting first evidence of decreased vital shedding um at least relatively increased biology shedding in those who develop the spy vaccination and another interesting study regarding the the the interval this is sort of a an analysis from the the shadows vaccine which is the astral seneca oxford vaccine is the chimpanzee adenovirus oxford one vaccine which is the one that they're using in the uk and they actually they published their data and we discussed it already but this is sort of uh they stratified their patient by the the time between the doses because no not everybody got the vaccine at the same dose like in the pfizer and moderna there were patients who received less than six weeks and all all the other groups who received more than 14 weeks and look at the surprise more than 12 weeks was better vaccine efficacy 84 versus 54. so um it it uh this this uh finding actually supports the decision of the uk government of spacing out the vaccines uh they did it to to vaccinate more people not because they thought they were going to have better protection but um you know sometimes it's better to be lucky than good they were lucky and in fact the the protection conferred by us by a more uh longer interval between those seems to be better 84 versus 54 and not only that if you look at the asymptomatic copy cases and this is one of the first data on asymptomatic copy cases only those who received the vaccine separated by more than 12 weeks actually had a decent efficacy 47 uh efficacy preventing asymptomatic disease versus basically nothing i mean it was worthless uh no effect no efficacy in in preventing disease if you got the vaccine too close together the two doses too close together so interesting finding from the astra seneca vaccine and the last thing that i'm going to share is uh and i i put the title still looking for a miracle cure because we're still looking for better drugs than than rendestivia and some of the other immune modulators so there's there i already presented i think several months a trial a small trial on fluboxamine and i have haven't heard anything more about foodvox i mean and in this group um i think out of california did a study it was sort of a quasi-experimental so they had an outbreak in a in a workplace uh and they offered fluboxamine to all of the people to all the other subjects who who have developed copied in this outbreak and more or less um half of them 65 opted to receive the drug and 48 decline so it's sort of a pseudo placebo control study because it's really not a placebo control it was open label but it's interesting that some some subjects say no i don't want to receive anything and others did receive the drug and they followed them these were subjects with mild kobe uh and they they they follow them and obviously interestingly enough nobody who got through box i mean zero of 65 were hospitalized uh versus uh a much higher percentage in the other group let me see if i have yeah i have the value here so these are the distribution sorry um yeah so they they they found um a significant difference between those two received fluboxamine versus those who received no therapy regarding the the risk of of hospitalization despite the fact that most of the people who would say this decided not to take any therapy were asymptomatic but they fared worse than those who received flubox i mean which mostly asymptomatic i'm sorry symptomatic so so you know surprising finding and it's the second story um so we're waiting for this large placebo control study with fluvox i mean early flu voxamine frubox i mean it's used for obsessive compulsive disorder it's actually a drug that is used by psychiatrists it's not an antiviral but it has some effect in there in some intracellular structure that seem to be important for the virus according to the author so interesting finding i think that was the last one yeah thank you and we can go to leslie thanks esther uh thank you so much fantastic um great presentation wanted to thank marla also so much for answering so many of the vaccine and public health related questions and for everybody on the network thank you so much for chatting in so many great uh questions today um dr doman daryl are you on the line might you just wanted to publicly congratulate you on your paper are you able to just introduce yourself sorry did i just temporarily mute or is somebody decided to like call the pond the audio went out and i was like oh i think no we can hear you do you have a video or are you on video yes just one second um sorry this it's been a bit of a crazy day oh great well congratulations congratulations um and if we're gonna have dr leslie congratulations daryl would you just like to introduce yourself uh sure so i'm i'm daryl doman i'm in the center for global health within department of internal medicine um at unm um yeah i think i spoke was it last week or the week before last week it was just last week yes yes run together um like most of you know um but yeah uh thank you thank you we're gonna have dr leslie hayes uh give her powerpoint and then daryl if it's okay we might um point some uh questions into your direction perfect yeah i have to i have to run off to something at one but i'm happy to take some questions before then terrific thank you thank you daryl congratulations um dr leslie hayes um primary care provider and addiction specialist from espanola hi thanks um dr sosa that was so cool i actually have some hope that this may be over after listening to you speak today so and just have a couple updates i was going to be talking about the new study from the cdc um about cloth and medical procedure masks and during january they conducted some experimental simulations um detect two things one was wearing a cloth mask with a medical procedure mask at the same time medical procedure mask first and then the cloth mask over it and the second thing is just knotting the ear loops of medical procedure mask at the edge and tucking and flattening it in so that makes it fit much better and it worked really really well here's sort of uh this is just a regular procedure mask in the middle is the procedure mask covered by a cloth mask which just the cloth masks generally have a tighter fit and so that helps and then on the side is the fitted mask where they've knotted it right at the very edge and that just makes it fit much tighter and so what they found is um if you have a double mask or a knotted and tucked mask on a person who's coughing it's more efficient at blocking the cough particles um if you have a regular mask it's 56 cloth mask alone is 51 if you have a cloth mask covering a medical procedure mask it goes up to 85 of the cough particles blocked and the knotted and tucked mass goes up to 77 um it's also more efficient at blocking exposure they checked you know if you had somebody nearby how likely were they to be exposed and um it decreased the cumulative exposure of the unmasked receiver 82 percent if you had a um cloth mask over a medical procedure mask and 62 if you had a tucked uh knotted mask and then they had the coffer be unmasked and the source be masked and they found that it reduced the exposure by 83 percent if you had the double mask and 64 if you had the knotted mask and then if you have them both with a double mask it actually decreases it by 96 percent or if it's both knotted and tucked it's um also 96 so obviously ideal is if you can have everybody doing this even if you can't you're still going to get pretty good and this is just um up top if you have the um the value if you have the unknotted medical mask basic then the second is double mask and you can see if um the source is not masked and the receiver is masked the difference between the two of them if the copper is masked and the other person's not masked then it goes also down it goes down a huge amount if you have both patients or both the source and the receiver double mask and same thing with knotted masks so um i personally am convinced i am going to start wearing the double mask i think it makes a big difference two caveats you don't want a double mask if you're wearing an n95 those don't need to be double masked and also don't combine two disposable masks that does not help then i wanted to talk a little bit about vaccine hesitancy this was an issue even before covet in 2019 the world health organization actually named vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 threats to global health and first study was just a preprint that vaccine hesitancy among health care workers and at the time of the study that this was done 36 of respondents were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available while 50 56 were not sure and um vaccine acceptance um as you get older more educated and as you had a higher income um vaccine hesitancy among health care workers lower acceptance was noted in women in black and latinx respondents and conservative republican healthcare workers also those working in a rural setting direct medical care providers definitely were more likely to take the vaccine and the concerns that people raised were safety effectiveness and the speed of development of approval and i just have to brag real quick that my rural mostly latinx and mostly female clinic had um 81 of us have gotten our first vaccine so we are way above these numbers so i'm quite proud of us and then i thought this was great these are some evidence-based strategies for vaccine hesitancy from the mayo clinic proceedings pre-print and the first was just to make it convenient for people policy level interventions and i was so happy to hear marla talking about what they're planning there reducing out of pocket expense requiring vaccination for child care school and college attendance participation and i think federally qualified health centers also um that makes a big difference and then um health care providers just need to recommend it and we need to recommend it enthusiastically they have found that if your health care provider recommends it it results in a higher vaccination rate across a wide variety of preventative behavior including vaccines and we remain the most trusted source of information in general and specifically in regard to cobit 19 and a recent survey respondents indicated a greater likelihood of taking the vaccine if it was recommended by the health care provider i must admit i'm a little astonished at the number of people who i ask them if they are interested in the covered vaccine they give me nine minutes worth of reasons why they don't want to get it and they say what do you think and i say i think you should get it and they say okay i'll get it and i'm just like whoa okay and that's all it takes so um oops next thing is to make sure we train healthcare providers um and obviously we want to know um good facts to talk to people about them but it's really important to train everybody in the clinic not just the physicians and pas and nurse practitioners i have been astonished i'm sure everybody has had this experience where you spend 20 minutes going through risks and benefits of a treatment with the patient and they're really not sure and they go up to the front desk and the front desk says oh i see they're offering you this that's a great treatment and boom the patient is totally convinced so making sure not just that the medical providers are trained but everyone in the clinic is trained really helps and then using a positive frame where you know for instance with the flu shot they say um we're going to give you the flu shot today rather than do you think you want the flu shot so just talk to them as though you know you think they're going to want to do it the other thing is to um talk about it in a positive manner benefits you're going to protect your family and friends rather than you might get really sick if you don't get it and they find that actually makes a difference and then the other thing is um you don't want to directly argue against people's misperceptions because that can backfire and make them sort of dig in firmly um you want to try and frame the message in a way that affirms their worldview already and explain the motivation behind the misinformation and provide a factual alternative and then repeat factual information and one example i'll give of this is people frequently tell me you know they don't trust the vaccine because it came out way too fast and they just don't trust the government and my response has generally been to first off respond that yeah i can understand they don't um trust the government around this but to me what it has shown is how inefficient the government is normally rather than that they're being unsafe now and then i talk about you know sort of that it really didn't come out quite as quickly as they thought that the mra mrna platform had been in progress for many many years before the covet coping vaccine came out and that you know these are the steps that we normally take to get vaccines out but normally there's huge delays in them as you know people wait in committees that this time they just decided you know not to have these delays so it really is more a case of this being very efficient rather than um than being unsafe and i find people actually understand that because it's talking to them about their thing and in general what i found with misperceptions is when somebody is talking you want to leap right in and say that's not true but let them talk give them as much time as they want and first off they're going to you know feel that you really heard what they had to say because if they think you're not understanding what they had to say they're going to ignore anything that you have to say about um contradict them but if they really feel heard then oftentimes when you say well have you considered this and such it really makes a difference and so um i think that's really important if we're going to talk about back stains with people and that was everything i had thank you dr hayes um carissa culbreth dr cobra thank you are you on the video today you on the call um well if carissa is on um i think you're still on i was going to have you introduce yourself um but in carissa is the medical director of tricore labs and i think she might be available for some questions as well but i'm going to quickly turn it over to carla for the multiple questions that we have so take it away carla thanks joanna thank you everyone for all of these great questions there's a lot of them have been answered in the chat so please pay attention to that because marla's putting in a lot of great information um actually daryl i wanted to ask you this question um since you're on and we we have you as an expert right now one is a question from alana benjamin how much genomic sequencing surveillance is happening routinely in new mexico right now yeah that's a great question so we've really ramped up efforts um since the beginning of december through january so uh we had a bit of a lull between uh the unm group and doh in october november um sort of when everything you know in our peak when when uh you know access to samples was sort of uh trumped by testing uh rightfully so during the peak um but we're currently sequencing somewhere between two and 300 per week between the doh lab and the lab here at unm so that i think we're on track to sort of hit at least two to three percent of all positive cases in the state which which this certainly puts us well within the top ten um and depending on the numbers you know even top five so we're doing really really well comparatively where the national baseline is something like 0.3 percent of all positive cases so really proud of our efforts here and i think that's largely why we were able to detect uh these variants much sooner than many other states it's not that they're not there it's just that we're you know sequencing now at a level to actually detect these much much faster and much earlier than in a lot of states excellent thank you so much carissa i do see that you're on i don't know if you had any other any other comments about that about um testing oh so we um we continue to um with um daryl and and unm colleagues on getting samples for sequencing um to be able to see what's happening in the state and we are investigating um the with the the new variants that they've identified we take residual of those samples and test them on our assays to ensure that we're able to be able to detect those variants on our assays in the laboratory and at this point we haven't seen any issues that we've been able to tell so far with detecting any of the variants that have emerged but we continue to have the collaboration with our amazing sequencing group to see if there's an impact on the clinical diagnostic tests so far we've not seen any any issues [Music] thank you so much and i also want to congratulate krista because there was a really great article on her about in in the albuquerque journal about her this morning so congratulations for that um okay um nestor do you could you explain the david tempus asked if you could explain the israeli pfizer study that confirmed 95 effectiveness but also the vaccinated people that vaccinated people reduce infection spread right so the paper was basically analyzing the viral loads of those who develop kobe early after vaccinations so i think they divided the the day one to 13 and then 14 to 24 and what they found is that those who develop kobe later after the vaccine had a significantly lower c lower viral load or higher ct values in their pcr the the only caveat is that we don't know really the exact translation of those cities to to viral load and if that means that they're not infectious or they are still infectious that's that's like another step they just analyzed or gave information on the city of those two groups of subjects those who develop copy early or late after first dose uh you know common sense tell you that you know the the lower the viral load the less likely you are to transmit but they didn't really give gave detail because they didn't actually measure transmission they just measured the viral load on those with kobi all right thank you and nestor willie have you um nancy gross is asking if we have any information that regarding bam lenivab effectiveness with the new variants uh well i i don't know i don't i don't have information maybe darling can comment i know that there are some of the mutations especially the ones seen in california that seems to escape some of the some of the monoclonals because they are the mutations in the region where these these monoclonal antibodies are directed against but i haven't really read anything specifically about bamla nimimad and for instance the south african and and the brazilian or the uk variant thank you and there was a question just knowing even even anecdotally is there uh do we are we seeing a difference between the two the pfizer versus the modern in terms of the reactions that people are having the um site reactions yeah what i have seen published from cdc is a slightly more frequent anaphylactic reaction with physic than with moderna uh it's it's um you know with the with the earlier vaccination here in the us the actual italian the number of anaphylaxis uh with one and the other and there was a difference uh in favor of moderna there was less severe allergic reaction with moderna but both of them had um this this you know complication of anaphylactic or or immediate reactions thank you nestor um kami mckinney asked what are the are there any studies show what are the studies show showing so far for increasing the time interval between the first and second doses of the mrna vaccines right the only one that i've seen is the one with the astral seneca the one that i presented um they they actually almost accidentally had different different uh intervals because they ran out into troubles with with uh with the manufacturer of the vaccine so some of the patients in the study actually way longer that was uh stipulated by the protocol so they were able to retrospectively analyze that anomaly and they actually discover uh that that um that the longer interval did better regarding vaccine efficacy and this is something i mean this is not new and it's not surprising if you ask an immunologist you know there is uh the longer you wait the more maturity of the immune system so the booster it's better the reason why pfizer and moderna selected those short intervals because they wanted to finish the studies you know earlier we have commented that i mean it's not but because there's a magic uh in 21 or 28 days yeah and and we know from other vaccinations longer intervals are even more effective but but this is a pandemic and and they decided to basically shorten the interval um to three and four weeks respectively great thank you and leslie there's a couple of questions off them asks um i don't know if you if you saw this but why why is why wouldn't two disposable masks be better than one um because the way that the the way i understood it is that the um procedural mask provides sort of better filtering efficacy but they're not fitted as well and the cloth masks are better fitted and so the um procedural mask provides better filtering and then the cloth mats helps it to fit better and that's the reason for that one thank you so much um joanna i'm going to turn it back over to you for more questions carla um marla there's a bunch of questions and nestor as well about um breakthrough uh covet after someone has had a vaccine and i'm wondering marla especially in new mexico if you have any data from the department of health or from the cdc perhaps about the the numbers of um breakthrough uh covet illnesses after uh vaccination i don't have any specific numbers i can share at this point um but we do have uh reports that we're currently investigating of potential breakthrough infection in new mexico so we are seeing that phenomenon happen here among people who've already received their second dose and have gone on to develop a mild disease so we are investigating some of those reports currently thanks marla um and and the cases uh presumably are like you said are much more mild than than that than what you would expect that's what we've seen so far in these early reports that we're currently looking into yes that's great news that's great news um i want to joanna yes mention real quick that um governor put on her facebook page this weekend that there have been almost 400 000 doses of the vaccine given um and i don't know how many of those were first verses second but i calculated that that's somewhere between 15 and 30 percent of adults in new mexico have been vaccinated which i thought was pretty darn cool it's really um leslie that's amazing um marla do you think do you think there's going to be based on that percentage of patients in people in new mexico with vaccinations do you think by that amount we're going to start seeing a reduction in the community spread of covid and we've definitely seen a reduction in cases over the last a few weeks and you know i think it might be too early to attribute all of that to vaccine i think you know we're seeing this reduction uh across the country so i think there are things we don't understand about kobe yet and we may um you know come to understand that some sort of cyclical dirt to these peaks and troughs and infection that we've not been abs out yet you know i think we have uh you know a large number of people who've been infected so we've got some natural immunity and then we also have vaccine immunities so i think we kind of have all of these things coming together that are you know the reason for our lower case counts right now um i don't think we can just say it's all vaccine it's probably a bit too early for that thanks thanks marla um does anybody nestor leslie do carissa daryl anything else to add on that no just a comment on on the on the on the rate on the breakthrough infections i think you know just looking at the trials uh we knew that that was going to happen i mean the protection was not a hundred percent and the reasons are multiple there you know when you vaccinate up a large percentage of population there are subjects with immune deficiencies or persons who have immunosuppressed um so those are probably not going to amount to normal response there's also a biologic viability in the in the capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies we have you know subjects that have natural infection and they do not have neutralizing antibodies so that's also like normal biologic you know randomness uh so so that it's normal that that if you vaccinate a million people there will be a subject with with infection or breakthrough infections because not everybody develops a robust um protection hopefully and that the evidence is accumulating hopefully uh hospitalizations and that are and that are going to be really rare you know if if the data is actually uh proven the way the studies and some of the preliminary data from israel are are true we're not going to see um you know many death in vaccinated people secondary to covet at least not in the short run maybe when the immunity wanes or or there's a new variant that escapes the control of the antibody we may see again uh you know severe disease hospitalization and that but hopefully and i i underlined hopefully um you know the the data that we're seeing is going to be uh supported by the real life experience of no death and no no hospitalization if you were appropriately vaccinated and you do not have like an immune deficiency or something that really impairs your ability to respond to the vaccine thank you nestor um fantastic um harry seibold asks can those breakthrough infections causing only mild illness be shedding large amounts of infectious virus meaning can we still have kind of a super spreader event from these patients that have had uh you know have had kind of two doses of cobalt vaccine good question what do you think that's a good question that i think remains open although i'm biased the more i read the more unbiased stores to say no that that's not going to be the case or it's going to be rare but we have to be you know attentive because these viruses have already surprised us in many many ways showing you know airborne transmission move the oregon this function you know there's like 10 or 12 uh surprises so i i don't want to be overly optimistic but i i really you know would like to think that the infector is going to be rare um you know like widespread translation after after you're fully immunized right thank you nestor um stewart miller asks any new updated information from various the vaccine adverse event reporting symptom in addition to kind of what we learned today from you and esther about moderna having um a little bit more increased sensitivity reaction um oh no i haven't seen any any new mmwr publications regarding the the vaccine reporting adversity and it fights for the one that has a little bit more moderna so pfizer was more frequent like 100 000 uh as opposed to to moderna which was 2.5 per million so it was less so one in 400 thousands if you those are easy to remember one over a hundred thousand and i feel active for pfizer uh and one in two hundred and fifty or four hundred thousand in for for modern so less frequent thank you um and uh pamela day foreign asked can a surgical mass be inserted inside the pocket of a cloth mask to achieve the increased efficacy uh in reducing transmission leslie did you read about read anything about that as i said the answer is maybe it just hasn't been studied right and okay you know the same with the filters um i there's just not been any studies on them so okay great um and uh a lot of really good a lot of really good questions uh dona orgaron asks how long should you wear a mask if you have been talking coughing sneezing um i think uh you know i think you need to keep we're wearing a mask nestor absolutely um we're about two minutes to the top of the hour um and i wanted to let everybody know that the questions that we didn't get to will will kind of scrub and make sure we get to next week but i'm so appreciative for all the questions that uh marla got through today on the chat and nestor got through as well and daryl doman coming on i want everybody to know that alicia parada who is a associate professor of internal medicine general internal medicine and she runs the post covert clinic at unm um we talked about the long-haul symptoms last week and the biologic agents that patients can get before they go into the hospital pre-kind of hospital covet she's going to come on next week and talk about how to handle long-haul symptoms and what she does at her clinic but primarily what what you might do for kind of post covert neurological symptoms cognitive symptoms headache things like that so she'll be on and give a short power point and also be available for questions and answers next week she gave a great presentation to our critical care echo for covid and she's delighted to come back and um we'll have nestor and leslie on next week and and hopefully our other amazing subject matter experts and we so appreciate all of you we did have the cme go into the chat at about 45 minutes after the hour and all the slides should be in the chat as well and i just wanted to let you know a few more echoes that are we have weekly as well as a new one um at two o'clock today um we have the first responder echo um and that that continues on a weekly basis it's the first responder resiliency echo for frontline clinicians physicians nurse practitioners pas and traditional first responders and then beginning this wednesday morning and for eight weeks wednesday at 10 a.m mountain time we have a brand new series climate change and human health um which should be fantastic we have 48 practitioners from 48 states and 78 participants from outside of the u.s participating so far i think you might have gotten a flyer in your announcement um yesterday on that climate change echo so i think nestor or leslie are there any last-minute announcements before we close okay fantastic uh carla had to leave a little bit early but we'll see you all next week,,2/15/2021
38,hi good afternoon everyone welcome to the coveted 19 office hours um nice to see everybody um i want to just start with some housekeeping items and some introductions i'm i'm carla thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician um here at the university of new mexico and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i am joined by my co-facilitator joanna katzman do you want to introduce yourself joanna here hi everybody joanna katzman here i'm a neurologist at project echo in university of new mexico welcome everybody thanks joanna so just um if you for those of you have never joined before we love to see your faces so if you have a camera please turn it on we would love that if you can um and we also ask that you keep yourself muted during these sessions unless we're

fearless leader dr nester sosa who's the division chief of infectious diseases at university of new mexico and uh he leads this amazing office hours infectious disease echo not that i'm partial and he also leads a a similar program for latin and south america and uh we're so happy to have him give his powerpoint presentation right now and followed by some more presentations so thanks nestor thank you thank you hello everyone from it's a pleasure to be here uh like every monday today we have a special guest we have alicia barrata from our general internal amazing so my update is going to be relatively short um i just want to highlight a couple of of papers that i saw that they were interesting over the last week so the first one is actually a very dense and and an interesting uh paper on on uh it's a cohort story on copied in the us um and actually it has many many aspects i'm just going to show one of the results of these uh cohort study they actually studied over 6 000 subjects longitudinally through the whole epidemic they did this cohort study and they selected a population of four four thousand four hundred um uh 59 uh subjects that did not have copied when they selected them and they followed them through the through basically to 2020 and early 2021 and they found 303 uh subjects that cerro converted for a community defensive of 6.8 and they actually go into a lot of details on the risk factors the activity that these people were doing it's really very interesting but i just want to highlight one aspect of the of this paper and was they actually asked these these subjects who got copied many of them without even knowing they had covered it and others who actually had tests um you know if they have been contacted by the health departments in their respective states this was done throughout the united states uh they included size everywhere in the united states and you can see like out of this 6.8 or 303 uh 64 were ever tested for kobe so there were some that that you know they they did not they now were tested and they there was like a 27 asymptomatic uh diagnosis so they didn't even know they had copied um um isolated look at these isolated from people when they had copied only 30 so a large percentage 70 percent of of the people who had who actually had copied were not isolated at any point so they they continue their life uh normally because they were probably not detected they were probably not contacted or or detected by the department of health isolated from people within the household only 13 so they they kept you know moving around and doing everything in their homes while they were having coffee so it's really really amazing these percentage quarantine after kobe only nine percent ask about copic diagnosis 17.8 and you can you can go down this list so this actually reflects you know the real you know experience because so many of these patients were as asymptomatic or actually the the epidemic was so overwhelming at some point that the respective department of health were not able to chase them and actually give them advice and that that easily explained why we couldn't control um the pandemic during those those speaks but i mean there's many many more aspects of this this interesting paper i give you the the link here so if you want to review it but that's what's just one aspect the public health outcomes and measures that they took with these subjects um was really you know not not at all sufficient to contain the epidemic the other paper is actually the sixth paper that i review on on the effect of single dose and i think i brought up one of those papers last week the effect of single-dose vaccine in patients who had already have choline and this is another uh one basically showing the same thing and this and this graph they have the level of antibodies that they produce after the vaccine these are the never copied so the people who were negative or naive and these were subjects with kobe then you can see and this is a logarithmic scale that um the patient who had coveted were vaccinated either copied because they had a pcr or they had a baseline igg when they were vaccinated they have a really robust uh immune reaction to just one one dose of of of the vaccine so i i have this suspicion that maybe some of the of the regulatory bodies i don't know here in the united states but in other countries where there's a shortage of vaccine maybe patients with code cannot can should receive for the for at least for the time being just one dose and that's enough give them a protection that is even higher than those who are getting the two doses and and this is actually not a an isolated period but as i said i've seen very similar papers already probably this was actually from real life from israel uh in healthcare worker from one of the healthcare system i mean in israel they took their her coworker vaccinated them and those who are already had kobe had a very very good reaction we just won those um so interesting uh the other the other uh papers they were actually two papers published in the new england journal uh in the latest um latest issue of the new england journal about the activity of the mrna vaccines or the vaccine that we're using here in the united states against the south african variant and and and and the way they did it they actually in one of the papers they actually built a virus they didn't use the original south african variant but they actually added all the mutations and then took serum from the vaccinated subjects and and expose this this sort of uh constructed virus to to the to both to the pfizer and in the other studies to the moderna and they compare the activity uh with the with the usual strains and and actually i reviewed this paper several months ago in a pre-publication but now it's officially published in the new england journal and this graph summarizes the result basically this is the plate reduction neutralization titers so the higher the tighter the the more neutralizing uh effectivity or efficacy is and and this is the the regular you all good old usawa the one that was isolated in washington strain the original strain that entered the united states and you can see that there's a drop most of the arrows or most of the lines go down where the levels of neutralization against the the one three five one um virus it's it's lower so you know translation there's a two-third reduction in the neutralization capacity at least in vitro uh of the of the serum of patients who have been or subject have been vaccinated with the this is the physical vaccine the bnt-162b2 the real question is what is this how does this translate into real life vaccine efficacy and we don't know we have to wait for studies and and maybe studies in south africa with the where there's circulation of the variant with the physical vaccine to see how well it works in in real life but at least there is some concern because there's a drop a two-third drop in the neutral neutralizing antibodies and at the same time in the same journal there was another uh study similar study in this case with mrna1273 which is the the modern vaccine and they also if you look at this graph the same phenomenon there's a a sharp decrease in the neutralizing titer in the id50 title of neutralization with the so-called b1351 mutations uh this was done with with actually with a pseudo virus so they incorporate the changes in the spike protein into this uh a virus which is not a coronavirus is another virus with with the spike protein or the surface protein mutated and there's definitely an effect a significant decrease if you compare with the uk variant which is the one that is circulating in the uk europe and in many states in the united states you can see that there's not such a decrease so at least the uk apparently is not doesn't affect the mrna vaccine but you can see clearly that that it does affect the the the modern vaccine as well as the pfizer the other question that i found on paper is what is the protection of a single dose and there is this debate in many many places including here in the united states should we vaccinate more people with one dose uh and then delay the second dose by 12 weeks and there's like you know dr farsi and there's a whole group of other experts which are actually debating this so i found a couple of of papers that may may help um one was an analysis somebody write a correspondence in the new england journal and aurora no swarovski wrote this article uh he actually took the data from the fda submission from the for the pfizer vaccine and he he calculated the efficacy of the vaccine 14 days after the first dose because what we knew was that the efficacy was 52 but they started counting very close to the to that dose so they he took the data of efficacy 14 days after the first dose so when you really you know when the immune system kicking and they they uh calculated that the efficacy was close to 93 so just one dose so so you know this is a strong argument in favor of delaying if necessary if you need to delay it because you don't have enough um delay the second dose while you get more vaccines um because you're going to have protection and then there's another paper now this is real life again from israel with the pfizer vaccine and they found an efficacy real life efficacy in this case will be effectiveness of 85 percent um between 15 and 28 days after the first lows so there's you know a pretty pretty good protection with just one dose um it may not be long-lasting they don't know because most of these subjects got their second vaccine after a month uh the second dose but at least they were able to determine a decrease in the in the cases an 85 percent decrease in the cases in the vaccinated group versus placebo so two pretty compelling uh evidence that that maybe if you have to you can you can postpone the second dose and you're still offering some protection to those who receive the single dose and in fact there was this uh like socratic discussion there was a clinical decision in which robert watcher uh um took the the delay uh strategy point of view and nicole lurie the no use the two doses as the as the the the clinical trials were conducted so there's this discussion and pros and cons of of delaying or not the second dose and it's very interesting in the in the new england recommended reading if you want to you know read the arguments in favor and against uh delaying that second dose and finally i don't want to complicate the issues of opening school or not opening school but the swedish uh published this really interesting population-wide study in which they look at the effect of school cluster closure on sars kobe 2 among parents and teachers uh in in you know that sweden took a very special approach to this pandemic they actually in in school they decided to keep um some of the schools open so they actually had um what they call the lower secondary uh schools open and they closed the upper the older uh students closed um and they found that the teachers in those open school had a two-time odds ratio of having a positive pcr or meaning getting copied twice as much as those who worked in close schools and they went even further they actually look at the partners of the teachers so the husbands the wife the boyfriends of the teachers and they had also an earth ratio of of 1.29 so 29 higher risk of getting copied uh if you were married to a teacher that worked in an open school compared with a close school so teachers do do um in my opinion and the opinion of this author do take you know some risk in working in open school despite the fact that you know that children's are not that good transmitting the disease and they even look at parents of children that were working in open school which is another concern and they still find like a 17 percent higher not much of an impact on the parents uh and on the end on the on the partners of the of the teacher but nevertheless there's definitely an increase and you can see it in the graph um the the this is the the confirmed cases it's higher in in those upper uh primary and secondary schools with the that they had they basically opened the the school it was uh not virtual actually physical present school so interesting and and also uh this is about you know about the same the cases but 100 000 you can see that lower those who are open 5.9 per thousand as opposed to 3.5 in those who closed so there was you know a significant and if and in the worst case scenario death there was one death in the open school teachers no death in the in the close school teachers so one teacher died and you can you can probably say that it was because and these are death by kobe um in in those in those schools so interesting um and i think the the teachers unions are actually looking at this data and they're asking for either vaccination or or or using some special measures to prevent them from being infected because there is a risk and finally uh rochelle wallenski the new cdc director dr fausti and henry walk that was in the cc wrote an article or an opinion article a viewpoint article on the variants in the in in jama so i recommend everybody who wants to sort of get a summary and high you know high altitude view of the variants and the consequences uh from faushi and dr balenski i recommend this this reading um it's not too you know in it's not too molecular or too technical it's actually a very practical viewpoint from from these two leading scientists in the u.s that's it i'm going to start sharing thank you thank you nestor us so much again i think we're all learning uh so much leslie um leslie hayes our primary care clinician specialist and addiction specialist from espanola hi leslie hayes i just had one article today um so that we could get to dr parrata and this was actually disappointing to me um they looked at ascorbic acid and zinc uh to see if there was any help for um cobit um and there was none and this was interesting most of the studies that they've done on covid mild to moderate covet have been how many patients ended up in the hospital are severely ill and in this one instead they actually just looked to see how many days until people's symptoms dropped by half they had a symptom score they were doing and they took 214 adult patients they were randomized either to get zinc ascorbic acid both or just standard of care and what they found was there was really no significant difference um in any of them in the time it took them to reach a 50 reduction in symptoms and um uh the patients who were on ascorbic acid actually had a lot more side effects than um patients who got standard of care or even weirdly enough in the patients who got both ascorbic acid and zinc and um mostly if you look where is it um it was uh a lot of stomach pain was coming and diarrhea so unfortunately it does not look like uh this is going to be the cure for uh cobin last thing i just wanted to remind people primary care is a superpower use your power for good and talk to your patients about the coveted vaccine and that was actually all i had for today thank you dr hayes um i'm so happy to introduce our colleague dr alicia parata who is uh i believe an associate professor of medicine and is the division chief of general internal medicine um at the university of new mexico and dr parrata is running the um post covid uh clinic at the university of new mexico and gave a great talk in our critical care covert echo a couple of weeks ago and we're so excited to have her come to our uh office hours echo now to kind of teach us about treatment for post-covet symptoms and what we're in for in the quote long haul so dr we loved it we're excited to hear your powerpoint and um we're hoping that you can stay you know throughout the course of this session to answer uh i'm sure a lot of questions so thank you thank you dr katzman and thank you for the invitation to be here um i'd like to acknowledge my colleagues who are on the call from the coveted follow-up clinic dr doyley and deborah bear who is one of our nurse practitioners and they've they've deborah's been in it with me for the long haul since we started this clinic and dr doorly recently joined us so um thank you again everybody for your attention and being here today we're going to focus on the long-haul or symptoms and some of the challenges that we have as primary care clinicians i am a primary care physician that is my has always been my main focus and passion um and i'll talk a little bit more about that as we go forward okay next slide and again our that's what our objective is today there's a lot of challenges um for patients and clinicians with this and um it's really i think it's just a really good time to talk and strategize how we can do more for our patients and for each other next slide so for covid follow-up clinton just a little bit about us um our eoc approved us in march of 2020. we officially started april um 16th of 2020 and you know at first this was um [Music] developed because as a medical director at the time i was seeing our patients really get getting pushed back and forth between the emergency room our clinics nobody knew what was happening and it was taking a really a really big impact on our patients and we serve a lot of people who have a lot of social determinants and we're really challenged with getting care and so that's that's one of the reasons why i jumped in to help to develop this um we've seen over 2000 arrivals that's um not unique patient visits it could be follow-ups because you know even from the beginning we were having questions about long hauler symptoms and so we knew that this was going to be a challenge we do in-person and video evaluations phone visits although they serve some purpose they're really not the best standard of care for our patients and um we're currently providing evaluation for actively infectious people so people who are non-hospitalized patients with covet infection we do monoclonal antibody infusions here as well post hospital discharge follow-up which has been you know a huge service and really trying to keep people from getting readmitted because they don't have a good and safe discharge plan and a lot of other social determinants that go into this and now um and we have been doing some long collar evaluations and are working um on shifting our focus now that things are changing um with the landscape of our coped cases next slide so what are the long haul or long hovid symptoms so this you know it depends on which article you're reading there is um the definition varies on the time but after recovery so i've seen anywhere between two to four weeks after their acute illness a lot of people talk about severe fatigue headaches and brain fog those are kind of the biggest things but as you can see there's a lot of different symptoms um things that we need to watch out you know hair loss smell disorder they still can't taste or smell for months after i still have patients who can't taste or smell after they had an acute infection a year ago um there's things that can persist for several months some people completely have them go away and it can be it can be completely independent of how bad their copay course was it doesn't have to be that they were hospitalized or in the icu these can be people who had very mild to even no symptoms who all of a sudden start having some of these things pop up for them weeks even months after their infection next slide there's a lot of different academic institutions and government entities that are really looking at this what we're seeing is it's likely multifactorial so there's a lot of people that we are recognizing that have previous underlying medical conditions that are either uncontrolled or are now uncontrolled because they didn't have access to primary care during the pandemic there's new newly diagnosed medical conditions that have not been addressed their medical condition was exacerbated because of covid even if people are not hospitalized they're deconditioned we know this we know that cova can affect people significantly and even young and healthy people who have had covid are sometimes knocked down for weeks to march there's also post hospitalization complications post-intensive care syndrome and you know and something new that's popped up in the interim what i'm really stressing with my primary care colleagues is we really need to evaluate our patients there is a stigma with covid that is real we had a big discussion within our faculty meeting last week and we were talking about how this was for people who had lived through the hiv epidemic how there were some similarities that were really challenging um and it brought to light you know that stigma for people and i have patients who we evaluated in the fall of last year who still have not seen anybody for an in-person evaluation we need to we need to look at any underlying condition we at our clinic when people feel frustrated they call us um we put an oxygen probe on them do a walk test six minute walk test we're finding a lot of people with hypoxia um you know there's that silent hypoxia phenomenon that happens and if we're if we're not providing an in-person evaluation for people they're not infectious anymore we need to do the due diligence also make sure you know are they up to date on their labs a lot of people haven't had their routine labs their thyroids rechecked on thyroid medication um a1c checked for um for their diabetes some people haven't been able to get refills on their medication so we really need to do the due diligence there and social determinants play a big role we see a lot of patients that don't have primary care and um so we have we have to do a lot of intervention where luckily we have a great care management team that can help us and therapeutic modalities there's not anything approved right now for any treatment of these symptoms and so that's why we need to make sure there's not something else that we can address and a lot of it is supportive care there are a lot of support groups physical therapy has been huge speech therapy we see a lot of people with some neurological issues which have stroke has been ruled out but they still have really strange phenomenon like speech issues um pulmonary rehab this is something that we're currently working on with pulmonary they're of course they're doing the work and we're trying to figure out you know when to refer our patients to the kovic pulmonary service on cognitive therapy and psychotherapy there's a lot of underlying psych issues that are being exacerbated there's a lot of depression ptsd anxiety tons of grief we hear the most gut-wrenching stories about lots of family members dying and the impact that that's on the patient an integrative medicine this is a role for integration of integrative medicine and other services and it's really you know it's going to be a collaboration with a lot of different departments and entities in order for us to provide care for folks and you know for current guidelines i know we want to do whatever we can and you know it's like bring it back to the basics let's do the work up um you know i've seen people getting sent for echoes for all of these huge evaluations and these patients still haven't been seen in person and had a basic workup so you know i think we just need to be reflective on on the things that need to happen of course if it's an emergency you know doing that getting the emergency care and a lot of things um are going to be you know making sure that labs are done um education reassurance and and a lot of social support next link and again more research needs to be be done we all know this um and and we are developing our consult services um currently our clinic pulmonary um their psychiatry is doing um a research study for the cognitive the long-term cognitive effects and that will be up and going in a couple of weeks the way to refer will be through us and so we're trying to get more information out there when we have things more solidified we keep working on the protocols and then other collaborations of course with infectious diseases of belief neurology and cardiology and again education for primary care clinicians in our community is really i think the low-hanging fruit here um we're all confused we don't know i mentioned to my faculty um it's not uh it wasn't on my 2020 goals to be like the covid outpatient specialist but here we are so um we will do what we can do to help to support people next slide and again this is just an illustration of it takes a lot of people to collaborate and work together in order to take care of these patients and to you know to further our understanding on um on this infection next slide and there's some references for you and um what questions do you have thank you um thank you dr paradis so much um wanted to uh just let you know how much we've appreciated the talk and let you know that we've been talking about uh these long houses for many weeks kind of uh really uh waiting for your talk and i'm sure there's there's already a lot of questions and i'm sure there's gonna be many more coming as we uh get to the questions carla do you um do you want to start with questions or would you like me to i'm going to get started and then carla's going to let me know um she's going to join join me in a couple of minutes um i'm going to ask questions to um to dr sosa dr hayes and to dr parrata dr pratt i hope that's okay if um i bring kind of nestor and leslie in the mix but before that i want to also introduce our uh carissa culbreth who's the medical director of tricore labs because carissa is our uh kind of laboratory expert and if there's any testing questions we always turn to carissa are you there carissa hi i'm here good afternoon good to see everyone again uh great thanks carissa and marla i don't know marla if you're on the call right now uh marley if you are can you say hello hi i'm here thanks joanna uh marla sivers from the new mexico department of health one great and i think marla is it correct you don't have any updates for right now but you're available for answering questions yep okay fantastic okay um so i'm going to start with um i'm going to start with dr hayes um is it reasonable uh for people who have had covet to delay the second vaccine to wait and see if they change the policy in the next couple of months um i think that might be a question for marla or for nestor i mean i can say that the official policy in the united states at least at this point is to proceed with the second dose as scheduled um there is as dr sosa said a lot of conversation happening um about if this is the best path forward uh given the amount of vaccine is that's available and the concerns about you know these emerging variants and another wave um so i wouldn't be surprised if we see some updated guidance um but you know can't say for sure when that will be and i think it depends upon a lot of things uh one of them being how quickly we can increase the supply of vaccine in the united states um and that's sort of a big unknown at this point thanks marla i'm going to turn to several questions for dr parrata now um one uh alicia is about um have you seen many patients with uh tinnitus or ringing in the ears post covet and that's from georgina gomez lieberman i've had a few um deborah how about you yeah i've also had a few at least that it's not i don't think it's um super common but i have read that it happens sure and then another thing i just want to bring up again i had a couple of patients who um their their primary care clinicians would not do a physical evaluation and look in their ear and they actually have cerumen infection so again is there something else that can actually um be the cause um that's something that's simple and we can intervene instead of calling everything along holler i think that's where we're kind of going with trying to delineate and it's really long haulers is really a diagnosis diagnosis of exclusion so we have to be sure that we're excluding the other causes so please please when people are non-infectious you know bring them back with infection precautions and um please do a physical evaluation look in their ears people still have sermon impaction with covid and a lot of other underlying things that can cause some of these symptoms alicia deborah that makes uh so much sense especially when a lot of these patients haven't you know even like you said uh had a primary care provider before and haven't really had a lot of good access to to care so thank you for that um what uh heather brisland says what what resources exist in and around albuquerque for pulmonary rehab so i do know i know unm is working on how they're going to bring people in for that are specifically diagnosed with lung caller i do understand that there are some other services like through loveless i don't i don't know all of the ins and outs as far as placing the consult and i know with unm we're going to have a pretty specific subset of people who will qualify for probably hyper pulmonary hypertension they have a lot of referrals already i'm just telling you what i've heard from dr harkins and so i can't speak for them but what i do know is that they're continuing to work on the protocols to get people in and i think it's pretty limited however thank you yes can i i i have one of the slides uh that actually leslie presented a couple of weeks ago about the sentence of long covet i just want to show it again because it's such a great resource let me let me just uh just one second i'm not going to take much much of your time but this this uh actually leslie review this uh um paper um and you can see somewhere in here i saw the yeah 15 percent of the patient complaining of hearing loss antennas which is the question that was asked but you can see the you know symptoms that have been sort of reported by these patients from basically all all all synth systems let me see if i have yeah this is i think this is the the reference so more than 50 lantern effects of kobe 19 a systematic review by sandra lopez leon and this is the the link for the for the article if somebody wants to review it but they they do they do a good job of like graphically summarizing all these symptoms and and in fact hearing loss is there 15 so a sizable percentage of patients it sure is nestor thank you and i i think um i think kent um i think kent might be able to put in that uh reference for everybody that that's terrific um i'm gonna ask one more question and then turn it over to carla there's a question on um occupational therapy um and uh do you see many patients needing to go to occupational therapy and then i also had a question i didn't see um you would it looks like alicia and deborah you're not seeing many patients with post covered headaches i'm not either actually but i see kind of uh it's not so easy to get patients into the pain center but um wanted a but yet you see that as very common postcovid symptom wanted to get your you know thoughts about that yeah the um definitely seeing um people with headaches it's really hard to tease out now too since this is like a really big allergy season here in new mexico so you know we had somebody today where we had to ask them to get tested evaluated one of our staff because they were having symptoms and they said you know just because it's allergy season or there's some other explanations we gotta still hope it's still alive and well and so we need to it might be lower numbers right now but it won't be if we're not continuing to be diligent as we saw in some of those other slides you know people haven't been isolating um we know why things didn't work when we've had these huge surges so yes we are seeing a lot of headaches again um we have caught people who are hypoxic i mean deborah has done several evaluations i've done several where um there was there was an underlying issue there i'm also hydration status people are not hydrating well you know especially healthcare providers um we have to give a lot of guidance to each other you know like we're wearing n95s in clinic we double mask every day you know i had to ask myself are these postcovid symptoms or is it my n95 use and so i did a little study on myself and you know the n95 was definitely contributing to a lot of my symptoms so a really detailed history of what else is going on with the patient can really be helpful and usually again you know it could be long long colors but we need to focus on some of the other things that are common common things that can cause these um concerns this is leslie if i could add something sorry um i i just tried to tease out what exactly is the headache too because sometimes it's all sinus there's a lot of covet with sinus and then there's also tension in the back so sometimes they really need more like a saline irrigation and others need muscle relaxants or a lot of times they have trouble sleeping so i am using gabapentin just some of the same things i would use in primary care anyways so um but yeah i do see i mean after respiratory and um i'd say headaches are one of the bigger manifestations that we see thanks debra and i see a lot of people chiming in that but headaches are they see it they're seeing a lot of post-covered headaches a lot of post-covet dehydration um so thank you for that um and i'm going to turn it over to carla thanks joanna there's a couple of um questions related to hypoxemia alicia i don't know is there's a question from jonas peloka i think what is the explanation of the silent hypoxia symptom and does this happen with other pneumonias so i i could not tell you the exact mechanism of this what i will say in our post-hospitalized patients specifically um well and even in non-hospitalized people we've initiated a lot of people on oxygen either because there was no access to the hospital in the time of the surge or the patients were refusing to go into the hospital we provided close monitoring and oxygen therapy we we counsel a ton on incentive spirometer use for pulmonary rehab people will just sit there for weeks and weeks and weeks on end even if they are able to get up and around and they have a lot of atelectasis now you know covet can also cause pulmonary fibrosis and other long-term changes in patients but what we see is when we really intervene with that that counseling and that discussion regarding pulmonary rehab those deep breathing exercises if they don't have an incentive spirometer um you know increasing their physical activity gradually like a lot of things that we would do in primary care otherwise with you know other other other um infectious diseases such as pneumonia that has taken someone down or a post hospital discharge so you know i mean we use what's in our tool box we've got a great tool box um let's open it back up again and let's apply those things that we know that'll work that are the low-hanging fruit and the low-risk things for our patients um otherwise i think that there could be a lot of different explanations for that um i don't know nestor if you have if you've seen anything is more of a evidence on why there's that silent hypoxia but it's real we see people walk in here and they're they're otherwise young and healthy and they're like i you know like you don't look well you you don't have a good coloring they're struggling to breathe and they keep telling us they're fine they're fine and you know their oxygen is like 75 or 80 um and and then we intervene and they're like oh wow i do feel a lot better um i don't know the explanation and i don't know if anybody else has seen any studies on that esther do you have any comment no not really i i mean i remember from this is way back in the hiv era when patients with pcp will have uh hypoxemia only with exercise they would walk into the clinic and you ask them are you short of breath and no i'm not and just making walk from one side to the other and put the oximeter and they went down to you know 78 and 80 with just a mile exercise so yeah it's something similar there's like a you know diffusion issue with the oxygen and the lung and and when you're at rest or with minimal activity you're sort of in in a you know stable but once you're stressed just by walking or doing something you you can uncover that hypoxemia and it it remains reminds me of that but but i have no other comments thank you um elaine thomas asked has anyone seen reports of pericarditis after after the oh this is different after the coven vaccine anybody know about that everyone's shaking their heads i don't know marla i don't know marla may have had to get off um okay so i guess the answer is no we don't know that very lane um there's a question from winona beakley she asked should we be referring non-hospitalized cobit-positive patients to the long-haul caller clinic or are you preferring to conserve resources for patients who have been discharged so it's nice to hear from you um there is so we we don't discriminate we're kind of all comers um for people and um like the word is out so the patients we're getting patients who we last saw a year ago six eight months ago who are still experienced symptoms and they're coming back to us because again we're the only access point because we'll we'll hear them out even if it's by a video visit i mean right now we're currently in a in a clinic situation where we have we're really trying to be diligent about the non you know separating the non-infectious people with the infectious people because we are currently doing the monoclonal antibody infusions so a lot of what we're doing with the long haulers is starting by video and then trying to determine what else needs to happen doing chart reviews and everything and the vast majority of the patients that we see are have recovered at home and then there's a constellation of complications from that because maybe they really did need a higher level of care and they never received it and so again we've had to place people on oxygen that probably needed it a month ago or you know some other sort of intervention that could have been helpful with their earlier recovery if they would have had that that evaluation so um we are currently working on what the outside referral process would be to us right now we are definitely open for people who have been served um at unm and with our affiliates um which is ihs first choice first nation thank you alicia lawrence carrion asked a question has has there been any studies looking at the igg antibody levels and long covered patients and comparing that to patients without long covid do you know anything have you seen anything like that no and alicia i just have a quick question on myself are you i mean you may have already talked about this but is there a definition um of long coven syndrome i mean is there a a case definition so that's where um i was reviewing again to do this talk because i gave a similar slightly different talk at a critical care echo the definition is you know it's persistent symptoms and it's kind of any of that consolation of symptoms that we threw out there p some people are saying after two weeks after recovery four weeks after recovery for certain clinical situations and consult referral services it's even further out than that um you know i talk a lot about you know this is a this is a viral syndrome so there is some time for post-spiral recovery that we would actually use for our patients otherwise um that did not have a covet infection so there is going to be a time of recovery i just had a patient today who was a patient that we start we initiated on oxygen young young 25 year old oxygen saturations were in the high 70s we initiated on oxygen monitored her closely because she had four children she's like i can't be hospitalized um and we've been monitoring her for weeks she's finally weaned off the oxygen um in in you know we're just trying to keep a close eye on her um and i did tell her you know now that you're recovered you know if if things are pers if you have any persistent symptoms i mean she had told me i was having really bad headaches and confusion at the beginning while she was hypoxic so we corrected that she said she was feeling pretty well otherwise you know and part of its deconditioning she's going to have to get through getting back to work kind of she's weaned herself effectively off of her oxygen and doing most of her regular activity and i told her it's going to take a little time and if she has other questions she can give us a call and i said between two to four weeks just see how things are going and if you have questions we can do another evaluation and see what's going on yeah thank you thank you very much there's a question from stuart miller um is there is there any current data or recommendation for postcode patients who don't have any obvious contraindications to take a daily aspirin to potentially prevent micro micro clot formation i haven't seen any evidence-based guidelines the guidelines for people recovering at home and in the ambulatory setting have not been very specific um i talked to my patients about you could potentially take a low dose aspirin if you're if you're otherwise low risk for bleeding or there's not another contraindication and it could potentially be helpful so you know we it's a shared decision-making process is how i approach it with my patient but there's no current guidelines that i know of thank you and i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme um linked to the cme evaluation went into the chat a couple of minutes ago and we would love to have your feedback um uh so if you give us feedback and you need to see me please please use that and i'm i wanted to really tell you alicia i really appreciate you bringing up this whole thing about evaluating our patients because i think like you said there's just a lot going on right now and people have just been not evaluated who have chronic illnesses for over a year sometimes so it's just extremely important i really appreciate the sentiment of that of that discussion and i'm going to turn it over to joanna right thanks carla so much um alicia i also want to thank you and hope we're not you're not entirely fatigued yourself after this hour you're being bombarded you sometimes with this session you have to work up to answering all these questions um there's a question from sarah dorley who i think she she said she's found that the six six-minute ambulation test to be critical for picking up exertional desaturation and i think alicia that's what you and debra are referring to um so it sounds like sarah you're doing that in your clinic i'm wondering if you might to unmute and talk about how you're doing that in your in your clinic i'm so sorry it was more a comment i'm working with uh dr parata and deborah and and prior to coming to the kobut follow-up clinic this is something that i had not done or hadn't seen being done as common practice but i think given that prevalence of the exertional desaturation with covet that isn't picked up unless you sort of walk folks so doing that six minute ambulation test while monitoring the pulse sucks the oxygen saturation through posslax symmetry has just been really really helpful for sort of a more thorough evaluation that i've seen that's really helpful sarah so they need they need a little bit of exercise to really pick up that that hypoxia great thank you so much um yes and we and um luckily i have dr dorely and deborah doing a lot of lit searches along with our other pa um nicole stromberg and we've really been working on okay what is it going to look like when we do our evaluations we want something standardized we want to be able to take this to our primary care colleagues in the community you know what can you do and when do you when should you refer to us or you know for people who don't have primary care or if you don't have the resources to evaluate your patient when to send to us and you know we really want a standardized approach we we strongly believe in equity for our patients and unfortunately we see that sometimes our patients are treated a little bit differently depending on the situation and so um the six minute walk test is something that we found um in lit searches that have been coming up across the nation um for the long caller patients and um it it picks up a lot i mean the other thing to consider is you know how many of these things were present before um covid and they just weren't picked up we see a ton of patients well i do otherwise had um you know they were diagnosed with sleep apnea and they're not treated or they had presumed sleep apnea and weren't treated and so we're capturing where kobet has just exacerbated that a ton as well thank you thank you alicia thank you sarah i've asked kent our digital librarian to see if he might be able to post kind of how to do the six minute walk test for us um um anna anna sadia i'm wondering if you might be able to unmute and talk about uh your question about the vitamin d and possibly your experience yeah actually i'm here um so i'm post covert it's as of beginning of february it's been three months but the fatigue um the headaches last for several weeks my smell is still pretty off but i finally called the doctor because things are forgetful it takes um words i try to find you know it's hard to try and find the words sometimes um so i did lab work because i do have you know past history of thyroids i didn't know if it was that um but he did do a test and i take vitamin d and my vitamin d was extremely low um so i was just wondering i know i had gi issues with it if that could be a fact or two or if we're having everybody look at just vitamin d levels because that can cause fatigue and you know hair loss and all that wonderful stuff so i just didn't know if there's been more like issues on seeing more vitamin d and maybe what would be the recommendation um for others right thanks anna alicia any do you see a lot of uh you know low vitamin d levels post covert i mean it's it's probably hard to find a correlation really real correlation so i'll just say as a primary care physician first um like almost everybody has low vitamin d because of our diets and such and sunscreen and what have you so a lot of my patients when i was taking care of my panel had low vitamin d we know that low vitamin d can exacerbate pulmonary conditions and i know there's been some evidence that low d does correlate to a worsened covet course so it's a yes and i think we have opportunity to again correct some underlying medical conditions that can help improve the symptoms whether they're long covered related or not thanks alicia i just want to make a comment uh yeah just to reiterate just what what alicia has said there's there have been several uh retrospective reviews on on levels of vitamin d and severity of kobe and there's definitely at least in this retrospective study and association clear association between low vitamin d before coping and having a more severe uh kobe disease there was a pilot study using high doses of vitamin d in spain in barcelona and they found a dramatic uh improvement in the patients they did a longer story with a thousand patients or 936 patients and they publish the the just yesterday i think in a pre-publication page in the lancet uh their experience with with vitamin d and there was also a very significant decrease in mortality six percent of those who were treated with with vitamin d and they use called a they use a different form from the one that we have in the united states they don't use ergo card c for all they use another one that is available in europe but it's a vitamin d uh sixth percent versus fifteen percent mortality so almost a a sixty percent decrease in mortality but and this is the the they removed the preprint for some issues there were some questions and things on the methodology and they removed the preprint from the lancet so we have to wait more but it was a very encouraging trial of treatment with vitamin d in patients who were um you know admitted to the hospital in barcelona with with coffee but for some reason the randomization process was not very clear in the paper so they removed the preprint so stay tuned uh i think that the you know it's a wise to see i mean a good decision to to have your vitamin d levels are corrected if if you had or or or are still at risk of developing copper because of the retrospective study the question is you know can we use vitamin d as part of the treatment when the patient develops hobbit or lung coverage like anna was mentioning that that's we don't have that much evidence but i mean the risks are so small of of taking a therapeutic dose of of bottom indeed it's probably worth it uh for the time being but uh you know there's no guidance on that yet thank you nestor so much what's interesting also is that it was not necessarily vitamin d related to you know uh eating or nutrition but once they repleted these patients they they did better um i wanted to also pinpoint everybody that kent our digital librarian he he added that study that uh nestor was talking about that early vitamin d study and also uh kent um at about 12 52 mountain time he put in the six minute walking test and um also pamela defern said that the six minute walking test is also valuable for how far someone walks during the six minutes and that that it can be used you know uh as kind of continuity so when uh you see the patient each time you can see if they're walking a little bit farther and probably you know how uh how hypoxic the patient is getting um so thanks thanks for all these good uh inputs um elaine gush also says in addition to vitamin d being low apparently hospitalized covered patients have often been seen to be very depleted of vitamin c and there's um making that study showing no value to oh so so she's just having she's just wanting to know nestor any thoughts that vitamin looking at the fact that vitamin c apparently has hasn't been looked at for any association she wanted to know your thoughts this is leslie if i could just comment the study actually did not look at whether or not they were more likely to be hospitalized or get severe it just looked at whether their mild symptoms were likely to go down to zero so it's possible that it won't necessarily improve mild covet but it might prevent it from going to severe but we cannot say one way or the other from this study so great thanks leslie um we have about three minutes left and i wanted to see if carissa um who we haven't had any testing questions today i'm so sorry if carissa has any thoughts right now given all these questions or if if marla has any thoughts or if nestor you or leslie or alicia have any last minute thoughts if nobody has any thoughts i just have one really quick question but i think maybe because alicia's on um there's a question that from naomi penalto how do we get approval for medicare and managed care plans when it takes up to six minutes to show desaturation from home oxygen if they have an oxygen requirement they qualify for oxygen so um i mean that's kind of the short of it we have not had a challenge in getting people the oxygen it usually takes less than that we've had some random cases where they were fine and then dropped to extremely low levels closer to the six minute mark but if they require the oxygen you just have to write it in your note great thank you so much thank you um i might ask one more question uh to either nestor leslie or or alicia from stacy brown have you seen post-covet vaccine studies so i guess vaccine studies in frail long-term care residents such as bleeding issues or pneumonia we have had two to three residents hospitalized after each vaccine clinic for various reasons one a gi bleed one low hemoglobin two with pneumonia one severe pain and so if marley if you're back on perhaps you might be able to help us with this too curious if any if anybody's seen any um you know post-vaccine uh new symptoms arise now i can make a general comment i mean we we have seen after the report of those uh elderly frail subjects in i think it's norway that that that die shortly after the second dose i have seen and heard a couple of of comments by experts i mean in really elderly frail subjects people who are like really hypoxemic or have a very advanced heart failure obviously if you have a reactogenic the regular reactogenic effects you know low grade fever malaise a little bit of dehydration you know you can end up hospitalized if you're 95 and you're vaccinated not because the vaccine is giving you an extraordinary unexpected result it's just a reactor geneticity you know a 95 i'm sorry a 95 year old with with heart failure gets gets fever and and he probably will decompensate him uh so so we are seeing the those uh things uh but i think it's just a normal reaction in a 95 and a 99 year old frail person that cannot withstand the effect especially the second dose that is a little bit more reactorgenic can can put somebody in the hospital for a few days and and and you know and and and and and even more than that so so and that's sort of expected based on their fried friability or thank you thank you nestor so so so much wanted to give a big big thanks to dr parrata for coming on for for deborah and for sarah for for adding so much information and want to remind everyone we're giving nestor a a week off next week and uh we'll see you back on giving to him two weeks off we'll see you back on march um eighth um christian bowers is going to fill in for nestor and we'll still be so happy to have leslie and marla and carissa on with us thanks everybody,,2/22/2021
39,good afternoon everyone welcome to the coveted 19 office hours really happy to see everybody today we missed you last week um i want to just do a couple of quick introductions and housekeeping before we get started we have a lot of great information to talk about today since we've been gone for two weeks um i just want to let everyone know that we would love to see your faces so if you have a camera we would like you to turn it off we definitely understand that people cannot have their cameras on but we like to see you we would also ask that you keep yourself muted unless you're call on called on by somebody on the hub team and if you have a question uh please put it into the chat and we'll try to get to as many questions as possible today i just want to go ahead and answer my colleague dr castman joanna you want to introduce yourself please sure hi everybody i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and university of new mexico welcome everybody thank you and i am carla thornton infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and um we have three presentations today by three of our hub members and as you know nestor's on a much needed vacation if you didn't get that news a couple of weeks ago so um we're we miss him but we're really excited we have a guest um infectious diseases position with us today christian ramers who will have you he can tell you a little bit more about himself but he works with nestor on our copa 19 um uh latin american echo sessions so christian's going to go first and christian go ahead thank you carla and it's really great to be with all of you i actually see some familiar faces there which is kind of distracting i have to say but it's great to be with you and i have some big shoes to fill i'm going to go ahead and share my screen like carla said i'm an infectious disease doctor i work in an fqhc environment in san diego a place called family health centers of san diego and then nestor and i have been doing our latin american echo together we actually both happen to be cuban americans so he has a little bit more of an accent than i do but um it's great to be with you all so i have way too many slides here i'm going to go through the first ones really quite quickly because they're mostly visual i think it's really useful to ground our thinking of cobit and where we are epidemiologically so i'll just show you kind of global and local numbers there i just have a couple of studies on long covet i'm going to review and then really we'll spend the rest of time on vaccines and variants and then a little touch of monoclonal antibodies and then hopefully have plenty of time for questions so i you know this is the the johns hopkins site i think it's just kind of mind-numbing to look at how big these numbers are um i actually looked historically back to influenza in 1918 and the estimated numbers were more like 500 million cases and 50 million deaths so we're you know it's been pretty darn bad but really not quite as bad as influenza back then by an order of magnitude or so but the one thing on this slide that really sticks out to me i don't know if you can see it here but both of us live in well many of us live in states that border mexico and mexico has been a standout in terms of the deaths that's been caused by covet if you look it's not even in the top ten in terms of numbers of cases here on the top on the left hand side but in terms of the death mexico is really right behind brazil in terms of the amount of death that's been attributed to covet 19. really a dire situation on the latin american echo that we do we hear of vaccine shortages and difficulty in hospitals and people dying at home and really not a great situation and it's just a reminder to me that we're you know we may be doing great in vaccination in the u.s i think we are i'll show you some slides to that effect soon but if our neighbors really are not vaccinated it's still a big problem for us and and this sort of we're all in it together theme i think goes not only in our own counties and states but also in our um our international neighbors as well in terms of where we are globally um for the first week in about a month and a half there's been an increase in cases this is from the who epidemiological update which are pretty good for these visual figures here these columns as you can see are case numbers and then the line graph here is actually deaths let's see if i can get my pen working here so what you see right here is actually a little bit of an uptick so seven percent increase in cases over the last week or so this is the end of february report and it looks like it's driven by increases in the eastern mediterranean region southeast asia europe and then also in the americas um cases uh the vast majority of cases are made up of the americas and europe still at this point 82 percent of reported cases worldwide and then the deaths also 50 more than half of the deaths being reported are in the americas up and down north america and south america picture in the u.s looks pretty darn good if you see the case rates on the top left really falling and this little bit of a plateau here is what has the cdc kind of worried that it's not continuing to fall and if you draw a line across i can't do it very well but it actually gets to the worst of our summer surge and our fall numbers that's really where we are right now so that's why the emphasis on not relaxing what we're doing because we're not in a great place still we're just at the level that we were in the summer surge and in the fall but the deaths definitely have fallen from our peak again they're still at very high levels here two thousand a day or so uh the one thing that is for sure and you're probably feeling this uh wherever you are as well as the hospitals are not overwhelmed anymore we have this really nice decline in hospitalizations here and so some of the restrictions that we put in place which were ostensibly for saving our hospitals especially as we vaccinate our highest risk individuals over age 65 we're probably not going to see the deaths that we have that we saw before some really good news in terms of nursing homes this is a nice dashboard that the cdc puts out there in terms of the number of cases in orange here and then the number of deaths related to nursing homes and that's a really positive trend again we shouldn't pop the champagne yet because this is still actually a thousand deaths per week from nursing homes but really a nice trend overall and i thought i'd share what's going on in california just a little bit our cases a terrible surge in january february and deaths going along with it a little bit of a lag there and now we're back into this thing where we have to start thinking about reopening and how in the world we're going to do that we have this reopening scheme which is pretty complicated and involves all these colors here the next slide is going to make your eyes glaze over because really how we calculate what peop what color each different county is in is based on what you can see here the adjusted case rate which is a case rate per 100 000 that's adjusted by the number of tests that you're doing the test positivity rate what percentage positive there and then we have a health equity metric as well which takes the lowest quartile of people using something called the healthy places index which is kind of a social vulnerability index and you basically have to meet one or two of the criteria in order to get down from purple to red to orange to yellow and just so you can see at the bottom here you know it's very different san francisco got moved into red because they're doing quite well doing lots of tests and we san diegans are still in the purple right now but it looks like um headed towards reopening the governor's actually going to maybe do away with this entire system and and include vaccination as the trump factor sorry to use the word trump but the factor that actually overrules all of this stuff because if you're vaccinating enough people in your county these metrics really don't really apply that much anymore and i'll skip through some of our local family health center's data okay on the long covid um i bring this up because if you're paying attention there's a lot of interest from the nih to the tune of 1.1 billion dollars to support research on long covet over the next four years and a couple of links that are in here on the bottom are from the francis collins the director's blog just saying kind of how they're thinking about it they're going big with this and doing a biological repository funding a whole lot of cohort studies really just to figure this out it's been so vexing what do what to even call this it just we came up with a new name last week if you haven't heard we're now calling it post acute sequelae of sars kobe 2 or pasc i guess is how we're going to call it um and there's not even a real consensus of exactly what this is but it's just a big breadth of symptoms fatigue shortness of breath brain fog which boy how do you measure brain fog in clinic i'm not really sure sleep disorders fevers gi symptoms anxiety and depression and i think we're kind of coagulating around the idea it has to be something more than about 28 days there's a really nice webcast that i put a link to right there which is basically a meeting at the nih sort of summarizing the current state of knowledge right now but this is actually going to be a major thing that we're going to start paying attention to now that we have all these people that have recovered from covid and when the threat of death is really not as much a lot of younger people still out there are going to get coveted before it's their turn to get vaccinated i think we need to pay attention to this i'm also pleased to announce that that the university of washington university new mexico and my organization have gone in for a grant to try to create a long cover-directed echo so hopefully some more news uh if and when we get that funded in the future one particular study that's gotten a lot of news and actually came up even in the white house briefing it's fun to see my former colleagues um helen chu is a um was a resident with me at duke and actually is at the university of washington now and did essentially a prospective cohort study of copa 19 survivors about 177 that responded to the survey and had some uh concurrent healthy controls 21 of them and they actually assessed acute symptoms really at the time of illness or within 30 days and then did a single point in time follow-up that was a median of 169 days after that and unlike other long-covered cohorts so the first ones coming out of italy and that type of stuff they had a real diversity of of severity so 85 to try to match what's actually happening in the real world 85 of the patients in this cohort were outpatients and never got hospitalized so probably more representative of what we're likely to see in the real world and the top line result here i put in bold and it's depicted in figure b here also in the sort of red circle here which is that um 31 of either in patients or 32 percent of outpatients had at least one symptom uh going out to sort of three to six months in terms of follow-up most commonly fatigue still an osmia or dysgosia and brain fog i'm not exactly sure how they defined it in this study but um you know pretty troublesome that we have so many millions of cases and a third of them may actually have pretty long-term sequelae and importantly a third of people reported worse um health-related quality of life compared to baseline and this is even in people without real major disease severity so a whole lot that we don't know about this this is just sort of a nice early epidemiologic study saying this is going to be a huge problem going forward okay on to vaccines i like to start with this which is pulled from my friend monica gandhi's twitter feed which is just a summary of how amazingly great all these vaccines are and how we really have maybe not sold these well enough to people but they are just really performing incredibly well especially when you look at the protection from hospitalization and this is not you know i'll show you a little bit what the rest of the world landscape looks like this is not just moderna and pfizer this is including astrazeneca and the early data from novavax and sputnik which everyone was very skeptical about um and then also the cinevac 100 protection from hospitalization almost 100 there was one person in the modern trial that got hospitalized after the second dose so we can't say 100 off the board but 97 and then protection from severe covet is excellent for all these vaccines and when we get into the nitpicky of just any covid that's when you get to these numbers that fall down a little bit the the cinovak being 50 percent here and j and j having a lower number 66 percent we'll go deep dive in j and j in just a little bit but really incredible vaccine so speaking of how to sell these numbers the j i think people are a little worried about that this might get misinterpreted as well i don't want this one because it's 66 percent and not 95 so let's go into the details in the next five slides or so this is all pulled from the fda um document that was prepared for the uh verback meeting which happened just a couple of weeks ago just a little background before we get started that this is all based on a phase 3 trial of the single dose regimen that contained about 40 000 people and there's also ongoing trials of a two dose regimen um which will be interesting to see if that's any different or any better and there's also ongoing trials of adolescents uh 660 that are planned my 12 year old daughter really wants to be in this trial but there's actually no u.s sites unfortunately um it's all european and australian so far and then really more so than the pfizer and moderna trials this was conducted in in diverse sites around the world so latin america including brazil mostly in brazil 40 of the participants were from brazil uh 46 from north america and 12 from south africa about ten percent had covered zero positivity already at baseline and then a lot of people had a baseline comorbidity and again top line results 66 percent here um and about the same by age but let's get into more of the details so we're used to seeing these beautiful kaplan-meier curves reinforcing what we already know that nothing really happens until at least day 14 or 15 or so and then you get a real separation of the curves excuse me um really after day 28 29 so a lot of their analyses are actually starting day 29 here and some of them are starting at day 14 but i think to really see how this vaccine performs you know the further analyses after 28 days is probably fair game right off the bat i just want to be really explicit about how these were very different environments with very different strains circulating and if you look at some of the text or the detail here on the bottom uh in the u.s 96 of the cases were identified as essentially the initial wuhan variant but plus this initial variant that we saw d614g in south africa 94 and a half percent of the cases were actually the b1351 and in brazil about 70 were identified as the p2 so really different viruses than we saw pfizer moderna having to protect against so that's the first thing and as you can see the efficacy vaccine efficacy as calculated is really different in these three places so 72 percent in north america 64 in southern africa and then 61 in in latin america um uh very few infections just a very quick point here um natural immunity still helps us and we've had a policy given the scarcity of vaccine in our environment here is we do not put people in front of the line if they've just recently had covet it is very rare to get covet after a natural immunity you can see single digit numbers here out of tens of thousands here so that's just a point that i think needs to be re-emphasized the cdc was a little wishy-washy on this you know because they don't want people to miss the opportunity to get vaccinated but in my opinion 99 days you're probably going to be fine these numbers obviously are very small but a lot of the discussion in the verb back meeting went around some of these lower efficacy numbers in subgroup analysis like you know in some certain people 35 or you get down to 43 but if you look at these case numbers they're really too small to make much sense of 11 versus 17 or 15 versus 26 so kind of interesting and controversial but really not too much to to make a big deal out of i think at this point but when you get deeper into the severe covet analyses and if you've read through this protocol there were like 20 or 30 secondary outcomes really a lot of different pre-planned analyses and this vaccine just looks better and better the deeper you go so when you look at protection from severe cobit and actually this is uh i'm going to favor the 28-day analyses because i think they're a little bit more clean but overall 85 percent efficacy against severe cova that is pretty darn good and pretty close to pfizer moderna when you look at um covid requiring medical intervention it would be it oxygen or hospitalization 100 efficacy here again small numbers but pretty darn good and then when you look at hospitalization 100 percent efficacy as well when you go past 28 days so again it keeps looking sort of better and better the deeper you go even this even holds up in our diverse geography so if you're if you're fearful about the brazilian strain or the south african strain or i should be calling it p1 and b1351 we still get above 80 percent in terms of protecting from these severe consequences in these different parts of the world and now a question that's been on a lot of people's minds and the cdc you'll notice just came out with guidance finally today about what you can do after you get vaccinated a big question here was do we have asymptomatic transmission of cobot and they set this up nicely in the j j trial where they did a serial conversion analysis essentially a cohort study going forward and you essentially see 74 vaccine efficacy to prevent asymptomatic uh cobit based on a serological analysis which means that can you tell people that they're not at all going to have any risk of transmission we'll know we can't say that but we can say it's pretty darn good at reducing the risk of asymptomatically carrying sarge kobe 2 and passing it on to other people so it's kind of time to start commenting about that tolerability was excellent really no major safety concerns lower side effects than those who were older individuals you can see these numbers in those that were greater than 60 years old are less than those that were younger as we've seen with other vaccines and just kind of you know things we would expect local reactions pain erythema and swelling and then the the systemic ones down here um you know 30 to 40 percent a little bit more fever than we saw with the mrna vaccines that's something to keep an eye on and then really only one severe allergic reaction which was not described as anaphylaxis they didn't really go into detail there but really we don't seem to be seeing the anaphylactoid reactions that we saw with the mrna vaccines obviously vsaf and the cdc surveillance is going to have to keep an eye on this a little further i think i'm going to skip novabax for sake of time but just know that that's coming down the pike soon and i want you to start thinking about just global vaccination because we are very spoiled here in the us because we're so rich and because we bought all these vaccines in fact i think more than a third of the vaccines that have been delivered globally have been delivered into the arms of americans when you look at the global picture it's not so rosy here so this is kovacs's estimates of committed doses in green and then optional which i don't even know what that really means that you know maybe we'll get there and first of all we have to span across all these different companies we've got sanofi jnj pfizer astrazeneca and then the serum institute of india is really going to be who saves us because they're going to be through intellectual property agreements able to make astrazeneca and novavax vaccine um but you know going through q3 and q4 of even 2021 this gets us to 2 billion and there's a whole lot more than 2 billion people in the world so we're talking next year before many people in the world will have access to vaccine how it's been going in the us not to shame us but we've been doing great in fact new mexico leads the country congratulations to you um getting 25 of your people with at least the first shot there i took a screen grab here you're at 25 as of last night um and then california you know not too bad we're at 25th i think but we've also given 13 million vaccines so that's a lot of people to vaccinate and the nice thing is the pace is actually accelerating i just heard that over the weekend on saturday it was actually 2.9 million people got vaccine which is great and we can conceive of having sort of a 50 to 70 percent immunity in the population by around june um i think we're going to get to a herd immunity type situation actually well before that because of all the immunity from prior infection um so really really nice progress in the us and i'm sure you're seeing your case numbers fall just like i am i just wanted to briefly mention what happened in israel to see a real world example of population-based effect of immunity and basically we're seeing almost exactly the same efficacy that we saw in the clinical trials so it's great news just to zoom in here this looks exactly like the pfizer trial data essentially where you have vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated controls and essentially like a 92 efficacy on a population basis now i was listening to a podcast from the economist just talking about all this there's a word of caution here which is that they've vaccinated 40 of their population already at least and it's all the high-risk people and the younger folks in israel just don't feel like they're at risk and they just say well you know i'm not going to really get uh that sick so there's a lot more i wouldn't call it hesitancy but just like ambivalence towards vaccine in the younger population and that's going to result in ongoing transmission which will actually keep the the pandemic going and apparently they've been on lockdown for quite a while in israel and are not making all that much progress and having a little more difficulty getting up to that 75 to 80 herd immunity okay i realize i'm going a little over time but i'm going to finish with some things about variants because i know we're all monoclonals are great better than everybody thinks they are and you should be doing them that's my message there and the nih by the way just endorsed finally uh monoclonal antibodies especially the combination product of bamlin of a maven at the seven mab um and uh the biden administration just purchased another hundred thousand doses of the combo to try to distribute for free to those who are willing to give it so i think that's a really underutilized intervention okay finishing up on variants a really nice resource here from the who in their weekly epidemiological update there are a lot of different variants out there but there seem to be only three that are variants of concern the nomenclature is just really problematic but we generally should call them b117 b1351 and then it's easier to say p1 which has another name b11281 and really you shouldn't call it by the country because that results in racism and problems like asian people getting um more violent crime against them that we've had in the last six months which is really sad so let's use the correct numbers it's not too hard to remember them they have maps of which countries these have been detected in and you can see the b117 is out in the lead in 106 countries the b1351 and 56 different countries and then the the p1 and in 29 countries and basically all this work is happening now in terms of whether this affects transmissibility and severity and neutralization capacity a lot of work being done a lot of it starts in in vitro studies but i think what we really need is just to see what's actually circulating in in humans out there um the us actually has upped our game and done a lot more genomic sequencing and here's a cdc website that shows us there have now been 2 600 cases of b117 reported in the u.s in 48 jurisdictions so that's pretty widespread that's basically this this map here um and you can sort of toggle the variant of interest that you want and if you do it over for uh b1351 um you can see that there are 17 states that have shown b 1351 that's the one originally described in south africa and then there are seven states that have shown that the p1 variant as well so it's definitely here whether it matters i don't really know san diego has had some of the best genomic sequencing because the scripps institute and the la jolla institute of immunology have been sequencing a good percentage of our cases and we found 165 so far among san diego residents and the mortality and the hospitalization has not really changed at all from before we had these variants and after so we're not really convinced here that there's going to be a major significant difference and the last slides that i'll finish with may have the key to why that is so you've probably seen some publications looking at you know these are lab-based experimental publications looking at neutralization activity of plasma or serum from people that have either been coping survivors or that have been vaccinated and you see something that looks like this where okay you know maybe there's a little decrement in terms of this one right here looks about the same slight decrement here when you add a few more mutations this is sort of to approximate the b117 variant and then um a little bit more of a decrement in antibody activity when you add in more mutations that looks like the v1351 that's for a pfizer serum from pfizer immunized people over on the right is serum from moderna immunized people and it looks really great across the board even including b117 and then you get you introduce b 1351 you see a little bit of a decrement there but the question is does that really matter are we focusing on the wrong thing just because antibodies are so easy to measure and so easy to test and you may be aware of this preprint that came out from shane crotty's lab which looked at the whole other side of the equation which is the t cell response the other major part of our adaptive immunity so again it's an experimental approach it's not it's not real humans getting infected but they took essentially t cell assays these are basically quantotheron type assays and tested these t cells from covid uh survivors from plasma as well as from people that have been vaccinated and i'll just give you the punch line and then show you the squiggly figures in a sec overall the results demonstrate that cd4 positive and cd8 positive t-cell responses in convalescent subjects or in vaccinees are really not affected by these mutations found in the variants so i vacillate day to day whether being terrified of these variants or thinking they're not going to be that much of a big deal and i think the science is not quite settled yet but if you look at these i'll just guide you through one of them on the top this is convalescent plasma from individuals looking at all these different variants they're color coded so the 117 is in gray here 1351 is in red and then p1 is in orange and then the california variant they included in there as well is in blue here and look at the t-cell responses they're essentially equal across the sorry i didn't do a straight line equal across the board here um which should reassure us i think um that that our immune systems may be able to handle the variance better than we actually initially thought based on the antibody studies okay i went a little bit over i'm sorry about that but i'm going to stop there and pass the mic to carla thank you christian that was amazing really great information let's go ahead and move to leslie alessa hayes can you introduce yourself and just and do your presentation and then we have a presentation by marla as well sure leslie hayes hang on a second let me find the presentation um i don't know where it's gone because it was up when i started let's see you want me to have more look up next and then yeah let me because i'm having trouble finding the presentation so go ahead marla can you just introduce yourself you're muted marla thanks carla hi hi everybody marla seavers i'm an infectious disease epidemiologist with the new mexico department of health all right can you see my slides okay yeah if you could just slide show that'd be great all right there we go perfect all right so i won't spend a lot of time talking about the johnson and johnson vaccine dr ramers did a great job reviewing all of that data but we'll just point out a couple of additional things um it is authorized for individuals age 18 or older i think one of the big advantages is that it can be transported at refrigerated temperatures so between 36 and 46 degrees uh fahrenheit and um unpunctured vials stored at that temperature for up to three months so you have a lot more flexibility with storage and transportation than you do with the mrna vaccines once the vial is punctured you can store it for up to six hours in the refrigerator or two hours at room temperature and there's no diluent or reconstitution that's needed so it makes it a little uh more uh friendly at the end point to handle as dr ramer said uh many of the vaccine recipients have the same kinds of local reactions that we saw with the mrna vaccines pain at the injection site being the most common a little more than half of the vaccine recipients had some sort of systemic reactions headache fatigue myalgias there were no serious adverse events reported and these mild to moderate symptoms usually resolved within a day or two of receiving the vaccine if you look at the updated guidance on the cdc website the clinical considerations for use of these vaccines all of the vaccine precautions contraindications and post vaccine management has been aligned across all three products so in other words the same precautions apply to all three vaccine products the there's no difference in who should not receive the vaccine and the waiting 15 or 30 minutes after vaccination again that's all aligned across all three products um one of the things to note in the table on the cdc website for guidance is about people who may have allergies to peg or polyethylene glycol which is an ingredient in the mrna vaccines a peg is not included in the j and j vaccine they use polysorbate instead of peg there is cross reactivity between peg and polysorbate so people who have a peg allergy have a precaution to vaccination with the yanson j j vaccine because of that cross reactivity but people who have an allergy to peg can receive the j j vaccine it's a precaution you know making sure that people are in an appropriate environment that can handle and a severe allergic reaction in consultation with their healthcare provider polysorbate is an ingredient that is used in a lot of vaccine manufacturing and so if you have a patient who's concerned about an allergic reaction to peg but they've had other vaccines successfully with no you know no allergic response um you know it gives you a little more confidence since polysorbate is a more widely used ingredient cdc and asip expressed no preference for any of the three available products you know there was some thinking kind of at the beginning of the fda review for the jnj vaccine that asip my might kind of use this equity framework that they've been applying to the vaccine rollout to uh you know make some prefer preferential recommendations for each of these three products to different groups and they didn't do that so there's no preference in terms of who should receive which of these three vaccines so a little bit of new mexico data um our vaccine outlook here so last week we received our initial shipment of 17 200 doses of the jnj vaccine and the way that the department of health distributed these vaccines again there was no preference around about targeting particular groups is that these were distributed to counties identified as having low vaccine coverage but high on the social vulnerability index to try to increase allocations to those areas which so far have not received as much vaccine or as much vaccine coverage among their population as some other areas of the state so really just trying to provide some additional vaccine allocation to those areas you know we still despite having increasing vaccine allocations each week do not have enough vaccine for everyone who wants one yet we still have more demand than we have product available so this is how these um additional bump this 17 000 was handled we're not expecting to receive any additional uh jensen vaccine for the next several weeks and that's just due to manufacturing on their end so we're not expecting any more of that vaccine to arrive until sort of you know end of the month so as i said our weekly allocation of vaccine has been increasing for the past several weeks we're now receiving over 85 000 doses a week and we expect that allotment to continue to increase over the next few weeks and you know we continue to lead the country in doses administered and right now we're administering 96 of those doses received if you look at the data from last week so one vaccine eligibility update um new mexico department of health uh put out a press release today announcing that we will begin vaccinating all k through 12 educators early childhood professionals and staff starting today march 8th and so the planned rollout um this week beginning today is that we'll be targeting educators and early childhood professionals outside of the albuquerque metro area next week so beginning on march 15th we'll be targeting those groups within the albuquerque metro area and then the third week kind of uh doing a sweep and picking up people who hadn't registered or been vaccinated the first time so more details of this will be forthcoming later today i believe but the goal is that we get our k-12 educators and our early childhood professionals and staff at least their first vaccine by the week of march 22nd and so this is a expansion of who's currently eligible and so just quickly who's currently eligible our frontline healthcare workers people over age 75 and anyone 16 years of age or older with an underlying condition that puts them at higher risk for severe disease you can follow our progress on the copa19 vaccine dashboard this gets updated every day and finally just wanted to remind people um to please sign up for vsafe when you get your vaccine use your smartphone sign up for be safe and track sort of those early vaccine side effects and help contribute to that data especially as we roll out the new j j vaccine important that we're still getting a lot of participation and be safe it provides us a lot of important signals and can help us detect any problems early so please sign up for this it's quick and easy on your phone and then just shifting gears a little bit looking at the epicurve for new mexico so you can see our case count has dropped dramatically from our high point in november you know and then we had another little peak in january and since then cases have come down nicely however what's concerning is that we're starting to see a leveling off so rather than the case counts dropping precipitously every day we're kind of seeing some leveling off we've had a few days with numbers that were a little eyebrow raising you know up in the 400s again so important to just note um you know that we're not out of the woods yet we have a lot of very hopeful signals um with uh vaccine and declining case rates but it's really important that we're all continuing those other core uh prevention measures across the nation we're still averaging more than 65 000 cases a day so it's not as though uh covet 19 has suddenly gone away and we're not continuing to have a concerning number of infections both in our state and around the country so before we you know start celebrating too soon i think it's important to keep that in mind and this just shows again that our our effective or reproductive rate has ticked up recently so we were below one for several weeks and and now we've increased to one so this is a concerning trend we don't want to see this number continue to climb and um again we we shouldn't uh be too quick to take off our masks and start to gather and and gather in you know indoor crowded spaces because we're just not out of the woods yet and one last thing there is a clinician outreach call tomorrow at noon our time or 2 pm eastern so this is a cdc call that will be providing updates for clinicians on vaccine safety and efficacy if you can't make the live call it is recorded and available at the cdc website and unless ken beats me to it i'll put that link in the chat thanks thank you so much marla thank you very very much um leslie do you have there you go you found it i found it and just if you'll just introduce yourself and hi leslie hayes family medicine in espanola new mexico i'm just going to be doing a quick primary care update and um mammograms in the coveted vaccine and i screwed up putting in that first reference but um there were two studies recently by meta and osutemiz i believe and basically both of them were case series rather and they showed four patients with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and the first one and five patients with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and this has been a real problem that it actually looks metastatic um like lip metastatic disease in the lymph nodes on mammograms so they're recommending either first off that if somebody is getting a mammogram they should definitely ask about whether or not they've recently been vaccinated against covid19 and then either get the mammogram before you get the vaccine or wait until a couple months after you've had the vaccine just so that that doesn't get confused and that's my daughter getting her covered vaccine and we were very excited about it so um and then next this one i was so excited about um this particular study took six lactating women um who were going to get both doses of the pfizer or modern vaccine between december and january and then they collected breast sample breast milk samples before vaccination and then at 11 additional time points the last sample was 14 days after the second dose of vaccine and what they found was that the levels of the anti-spike igg and iga went up compared to pre-vaccine um none of them had really any speci um cyrus co v2 immunoglobulins in the breast milk before but they started to go up at day seven after vaccine there was um and this was pretty much the same between both the moderna and pfizer there was a lot of variability in between subjects and also um at various time course but um both vaccines produced really good antibody levels in the breast milk and here's just the back um picture here's um where their antibodies were prior to uh getting the vaccine and then as you can see both iga and iga igg went up significantly so um see if we can get those pregnant women vaccinated because this is just i think one of the coolest things around and then um as everybody knows i'm a silver lining kind of gal and so this was actually kind of exciting that flu deaths are way down in children this year um last year the flu killed about 200 children this year only one child in the united states has died from flu and here's a picture of the last three years and pediatric flu deaths and as you can see it's very very low this year and i've read multiple explanations for this and i'll actually defer to dr ramos and dr sivers as to which one it actually is whether it's that we had increased vaccine this year that we're wearing masks and washing hands in social distancing or maybe just that there's another you know the cove virus that is kind of pushing everything else aside um i just assume not sign up for another covet epidemic but if it's the vaccines and the wearing masks i'm more than willing to continue to do that if we could keep flu deaths this low and then some additional reading this one was actually from september but i missed it and it's just about various physicians in the united kingdom who um and it's just their stories of long covet and um some of them had symptoms for months and months very severe almost none of them were able to work and then the atlantic had a really good article by james hamblin on the false dilemma of vaccination risk of people trying to figure out what they could do differently from vaccination and his point was that it doesn't really matter whether you've been vaccinated or not it's whether or not you actually are living in a place where the covid numbers have dropped and that's really what's important about vaccination um is not what you as an individual can do but that the numbers will drop and then we can all do things differently um really very touching article in the new york times um who i lost that goes through various people talking about family members that they've lost or friends and um it just helps to put a human face to it and then lastly if anyone has not watched the video of dolly parton getting her vaccine dolly parton is just amazing she donated over a million dollars to moderna to help fund the research but she actually did not get her vaccine i think until march 4th or something like that i don't know if tennessee is just that slow because she's over 75 and i would think she would have been in the first group but in any case it's very sweet to see quite how excited she is about getting it and it'll just make you feel good and then one last thing let's say we have one person who's convinced to miss information on average they pass it on or convince three other people this means there's a narnaud of three but if you teach just 67 of people basic epidemiology and statistics you can get are not less than one containing the epidemic this is called nerd immunity go out there and fight misinformation and you all have a great day thank you so much leslie that's great um i just wanted to also a carissa call breakthrough on who's the um infectious diseases medical director at tricor carissa do you have any uh announcements or anything you wanted to share um no no announcements testing is still status quo and all of our assays so far are purported to be able to detect any of the variants any of the regional variants and so we continue to monitor that with the manufacturers but to date all of the assays that we use in our lab are able to to detect all of the variants that were discussed earlier excellent thank you very much all right um i'm gonna go ahead and turn it over to joanna to start asking questions we have about close to 15 minutes left a little over 15 minutes right thank you everybody in a couple minutes our cme ceu link will be in the chat and if you don't need to uh get cme or ceu please feel free to still you know put in your thoughts and you know ideas of how we can improve the program still i'm going to start with kim joy and wanted to let you know that dr ramoros has already put in a lot of answers to some of the questions i won't maybe go over some of those questions but the important ones i still might ask dr ramers and uh dr hayes and marla as well um kim joy says what is the most recent update evidence showing how long protection from the vaccines uh last i think dr reimers you remarked a little bit about it but i think it's important to just go over that if you could uh sure so it's kind of two different questions about natural immunity versus vaccines the link that i put in is a extensive study of people that have had kobit so maybe a little bit different um and and shane crowdy who boy you should follow him on twitter there's lots of really good good things in there about his his lab and what he's doing he's really fully characterized the immune response to covet better than anyone else has and this study that was published was a complete survey of all compartments of the immune system and they do a really nice job visually laying things out but very very strong responses an average of six months after the infection so they essentially quantify it as about a 95 of people will have multiple compartments of their immune system that still have memory meaning b cells t cells other things um so 95 that's pretty darn good in terms of um memory and duration of protection after vaccination it just hasn't been long enough for us to actually see um you know i saw a paper in the new england journal that moderna uh the the the decrement of the curve of antibody levels was almost negligible three months after the moderna vaccine so we just need more time to see what happens six months nine months that type of thing afterwards um you know a lot of memory can persist for a very very very long time in fact i just saw a news clip about someone i think who was over 100 years old who survived the 1918 um influenza pandemic and still had memory in their immune system that was detectable from then so i'm encouraged by it um the one uh thing that's a little bit uncertain is that other coronaviruses uh immunity seems to be like 12 to 18 months and then things change and i don't think we know enough about exactly what happens there and then variants might change things a little bit and just sort of dodge some of our immune response but the the evidence that's out there is really quite encouraging uh thank you dr ramers um really appreciate that a question from uh pam brown and i think it's relating to um perhaps dr hayes talk uh either this week or last um are there antibodies present in breast milk and women with prior covet infections so i haven't seen anything specifically on that but i gotta think there is i mean you know we've seen that over and over that um anything that uh given within three to six months that's why we give the tdap shot during pregnancy so that women have passed pertussis antibodies but i will look that up and get back to you next week awesome awesome uh pamela defernas is there concern in new mexico about giving unused doses at the end of a vaccination clinic to people outside of those currently eligible you know we here in many other many states including california dr ramer is about people you know going to clinics quote unquote on standby and getting you know getting in line for uh unused vaccinations at the end of the day and i guess their pamela's wanted to know is that being done in new mexico that guess this is a question possibly for marla is that be done in new mexico and can it be done and if not why i guess yeah i mean i've definitely heard some anecdotal reports about that happening and people have you know some people have successfully been able to um obtain vaccine that way um there's also been some problems where you know maybe 10 people have been waiting around all day hoping for an extra vaccine and at the end of the day there's only two vaccines available and that's caused some problems you know we're really discouraging people um to not do that to not just hang out at a pharmacy all day hoping for the best but to register through the app we don't want any vaccine to go to waste so if there are doses left at the end of the day each vaccine provider you know is asked to have a strategy to make sure that those vaccines do not go to waste and that might be calling someone who is a patient at their clinic or you know vaccinating clinic staff who may be previously declined a vaccine but having a way to make sure that none of that vaccine goes to waste and so occasionally that will result in someone being vaccinated kind of out of out of order um but better not to waste any doses great so thanks marla so it sounds like what you're doing is a little more proactive you're having the clinics kind of look in advance and see what's available and maybe make those calls and have the have kind of patients on the list come in great um kate morton asked as people go outside of new mexico and i i've heard this too for vaccinations such as to pharmacies in amarillo or lubbock is there a mechanism for counting them in the new mexico vaccination data or do these out-of-state vaccine sites use the nm-siss to report i guess a question for you marla again yeah so there is a way in your vaccine registration your profile if you've received a vaccine that you weren't scheduled for through the portal there is a place where you can update your profile to say i received my first vaccine so you click that box it will ask you for the date and you know which vaccine you received so that they make sure they send you information about scheduling your second dose when it's due so there is a way to sort of update yourself in the system and say hey i already got vaccinated um even though it wasn't through the app so that way you get put in the right queue for your second dose thanks marla so much um naomi kistan asks any new or ongoing data on pregnant women who have been vaccinated maybe for for dr reimer marla or or dr hayes i'll just briefly say there i put a response in the chat too there's just a very small number that were in the clinical trials you know double digits maybe but i heard over the weekend that cdc is tracking this and has a special module within vsafe that if you are pregnant and choose to receive the vaccine you can enter that and there's not more than 30 000 women that have entered that module so there's going to be more safety data coming um uh theoretically the idsa actually had a podcast about this with ob with the american college of ob gyn as a member in the podcast and there's not really that much of a theoretical concern here in terms of teratogenicity or things like that in fact the data about protection holds over other vaccines that we've used like pertussis and influenza and those things so more safety data coming that i think reassure us all but um this should be individual decision discussion with the provider about risks and benefits and most of all the conversations i've had the benefits far outweigh the risks thank you so much dr ramers um a question from bruce tempest can you tell us about the inhaled a prescription exocd 24 to prevent cytokines storm from israel being used in brazil do you know anything about that dr ramers i just had 15 seconds to look it up while other people were talking and um bruce i think you've stumped me but this is a this is a biological immunomodulator that's in phase 2 trial so it looks like it will address the cytokine storm in some way and you know more info to come great um back to you carla if you'd like thank you joanna um there's a couple just um new mexico specific questions marlo i think that for you if you have can give us information um the there's a question about if you have any estimate now about when vaccine will be open to all adults in the community i wish i did i don't have a definite estimate um but as i said during my talk i can share that our vaccine allotments that are coming into new mexico continue to increase week over week and so as long as that good supply chain continues you know we should be able to start moving through the people in the eligible tears much more quickly than we were able to several weeks ago when you know we were only receiving 20 or 30 000 vaccines a week into the state so you know we're really sort of hitting our stride now uh with supply and vaccine roll out so i expect things will start to go much quicker than they have thank you so much and um there is also just a question actually from joanna about the pharmacies that are currently vaccinating people is there is that if you can just give us an update about that yeah so there's pharmacies that are vaccinating kind of on two different tracks so we have pharmacies who are enrolled vaccine providers with the new mexico department of health and are receiving some of that allotment that comes into the state each month um so their partners as distribution points for vaccine around the state so that's one bucket of pharmacies um and you know includes all the sort of retail pharmacy chains albertsons walgreens cvs leader pharmacies and then there's also a second vaccine supply chain that's coming in to states now that is through the federal allotment that's going directly to pharmacies and so there are three pharmacies uh chains in new mexico that are currently part of that federal pharmacy partnership walgreens cvs and again the leader net pharmacy networks who are receiving vaccine directly from hhs and that's in addition to the amount that's being allowed to the state department of health and being distributed each week so the number of pharmacies participating is growing but there's sort of these two separate tracks um of how vaccine is getting into pharmacies right now thank you so much um i want to see bruce bruce mann can you unmute yourself and just ask your question do you have that's um [Music] that's an excellent question whether i can unmute myself um which is the opposite of what most people ask me to do uh so the the the issue of severe disease and hospitalizations and death certainly the accumulating information is wonderful and favorable but i'm wondering in terms of the efficacy studies that happened with moderna and pfizer bnt there were so few cases in the placebo arm and the studies weren't powered for those secondary outcomes is is the growing enthusiasm more based on the effectiveness the actual real-life effectiveness data that's coming out of israel and uk and other places thank you christian can you comment on that i'm sorry could you repeat the question i was chatting you know i also went to ucsd school of medicine so i'm feeling particularly hurt um my my question is do you think that the enthusiasm for the vaccines being effective real life effectiveness against uh severe disease uh death and so on is based more on the effectiveness research that's coming out of the uk in israel rather than the initial efficacy trials which had very few cases in the placebo arm and and they really weren't powered for for those secondary outcomes yes i do i think the i didn't spend too much time on it but the israel data is really quite striking and then the j j i think had a like i said the secondary outcome list of the j trial was 10 times longer than the other pfizer moderna trials so i think i think the growing enthusiasm is in in step with the growing evidence um uh regarding the um the protection from severe disease thank you great thank you very much um let's see there are we've gotten to a lot of the questions but there's there's a couple more let me see um elaine strothers marla i don't think i don't think we do but can ask does new mexico have a kova tracker app uh we do not that i'm aware of okay i didn't think so um and there's a question from donna or on about can we get both injections in the same arm i know it's re go ahead christian what are you going to say i was going to say i i don't think this was um actually published in the in the large clinical trial papers but i'll i'll find a link um uh the newing journal has a really nice photo uh montage of what they're calling the seven-day itch on moderna recipients where there's you know looks like us i see linda hellyer is itching her arm right now uh it looks like cellulitis actually um and so i don't really have any advice i i got mine in opposite arms i don't really know why i think you can do whatever you want there's really not a definitive way to tell either way but that's the best answer i have and i'll just add cdc did update their guidance a couple of weeks ago for people who have had that delayed hypersensitivity reaction they did make a recommendation that people get their second dose in the opposite arm but that's the only recommendation about switching arms that i'm aware of thank you marla um linda gorgos do you want to unmute yourself i didn't actually see the question about my mole new privateer but do you want to report there's kind of a new wave of treatments coming along for covid that work in different ways than monoclonals do the malnopiravir is a direct antiviral that's been developed by merck it actually inhibits viral replication directly so not antibody dependent it's dosed orally and uh the phase 2a data was recently presented this drug is moving forward into phase 3 trials both in outpatient and inpatient settings so our site here in santa fe is going to be a site for the outpatient trials who will enroll people with early mild to moderate covid start on oral treatment and then be monitored and it's looking at hospitalizations deaths and other medical outcomes and they'll also be an inpatient arm my understanding from what i heard a couple of weeks ago is unm is also going to be a site i'm not sure whether they're in the outpatient or the inpatient arm of the trial but i think you know we clearly need new options for treatment as we move along that aren't infusion dependent yeah thanks so much linda great session everyone thank you so much for all of your input um and please if you need to see me go ahead and fill out the cme um go ahead and fill out the cme and we can and that would be great and we would love to get into your feedback i also just wanted to announce that we have our first responder resiliency tele echo program today from two to three and the topic is apd lead diversion program which should be very very interesting for those of you here in new mexico um and critical care echo is next not this thursday but the next the 18th and we're it's going to be eric cry talking about the use of ecmo in um cobia 19 patients so again thank you so much for joining and thank you very much christian for being our guest and well you're welcome back anytime and we will see everybody next week thank you everybody,,3/8/2021
40,everyone welcome to the coveted 19 office hours tele echo session we're really excited to see everybody and and welcome back well nestor we're happy to have nestor back today um just a couple of housekeeping housekeeping announcements if you have a camera we would love to see your face so please leave it on um if you can um i understand that all of you can't but we would love to see your faces if we can um we would also ask that you keep yourself muted during the session unless we call on you to ask your question or call on you with a question and if you have a question during the session please put it in the chat box so great i think we're going to go ahead and get started actually we have a presentation by both nestor leslie and marla today so we're gonna we have a lot of presentations so i believe i will turn it over to nestor now and he can introduce himself and go ahead and start with his slides sure thank you thank you very much i'm glad to be back uh here let me see if i can share my screen okay let me put this in presentation mode okay there we here we go so okay so i'm going to review different um different articles that i that i was um lucky enough to read during my two-week vacation uh first of all this this publication um it's a research letter that was published in yama network outcomes and mortality among adults hospitalized with kobe in u.s medical center this is sort of a after one year of of a pandemic it's sort of a review of of the survival and and uh by age and also by month uh throughout the the especially the initial phase of the pandemic and i found it was very interesting there's definitely this clear-cut difference in the survival probability and and age and you can see that uh subjects were that are uh over 80 had a you know almost 30 percent mortality or seven percent seventy percent survival when they develop kobe so almost a thirty percent um and this uh proportion uh of the survival uh uh increases the younger you are so it's a cl there's a clear-cut uh relationship between the age and this is a study that included almost um 550 medical centers in the united states more than 292 000 patients and the other interesting phenomenon which is encouraging is the fact that um the the late in the pandemic the better the survival you can see that the worst survival wasn't march the first month of the pandemic in the u.s april and then the closer you get to the press and the higher the survival and that basically translate the learning curve from the physicians managing these cases the availability of of friend desi beer and dexamethasone and other interventions like anti-coagulation and prone so we got better we definitely got better are saving life lives um during the pandemic and and this graph really summarizes that so they're an interesting interesting paper uh talking about vaccines and variants which is like the hot topic there was a publication last week in the new england journal in which they took serum from 20 subjects that had the the physical vaccine this is the the physical vaccine two doses of the physio vaccine the bnt 162 b2 and they actually constructed viruses pseudo viruses with this with the spike protein of the different variants the original usa washington one which is like the wild type original strain that's circulated in the u.s the uk or b117 spy protein the p1 which is the brazilian the south african and others of the south african with some deletions and the take-home message of this story is that the you know there's still a pretty decent according to this this story which was sponsored by pfizer a pretty decent activity on neutralizing activity um of the of the serum of vaccinated subjects against most of the variants obviously with a with a significant drop in the ability to neutralize um the virus that has the south africans so the south african is definitely the most concerning even more than the brazilian that is very very similar uh regarding the number of mutation but there's definitely the south african seems to be the troubled child and and not only that there's also evidence as we know that the nova backs vaccine the johnson and johnson and astra seneca had a significant drop in in its efficacy in the clinical trials when they were uh when the patient were enrolled in south africa where the where the variant was most prevalent there's another study that i will review next week that shows an even more worrisome um picture with this variant is definitely uh less susceptible to inhibition by by uh the antibodies produced by the vaccine but the good news is that the the strains that are circulating in europe and the us the original one and and the other the the uk barian are are still very susceptible to inhibition or neutralization with with the uh with the current uh vaccines available to us the other strain that i haven't really talked about is the the the strains that have been isolated in california and they they actually two lineages four to seven and 429 and the the the main um characteristics is that this um mutant or this variant has um three uh mutations in the in the spy protein the most important is the 452 which is very close and this is a the spike protein and the ace receptor and although this is not exactly in the area where the where the ace receptor and the protein interact it does changes the confirmation or the the characteristics of the protein very close to the to the rbd to the receptor binding domain so it's thought to be important um and these two lineages from california are definitely becoming more frequent and this this graph in the middle shows how it was basically zero percent of the isolations in september and now it's up to 50 percent and that is sort of an indirect indication of its transmissibility that is probably more more transmissible than the old wild type virus and also when you compare the amount of virus in the nasopharynx of the patients who had the the non um 427 429 so the old all variants with the new variants the the ct value it's lower meaning that they have a higher a twofold higher um buyer load in their nasal firing so although probably not as concerning as the the south african variant there's this is definitely an evolution of the virus that has been detected in california that seems to give higher transmissibility or be associated with higher transmissibility and higher uh levels of virus in the in the nasopharynx and when you look at the capacity of vaccine recipients to neutralize uh the the the variant specifically the 429 and and also convalescent plasma neutralizing the 427 you can see that there's a drop in the levels um a drop that it's around four to six fold less susceptible to neutralization so this is definitely a variant of concern because it's less susceptible more transmissible maybe not to the level as i said of the south africa but it's definitely um you know something that if especially if it accumulates more mutation uh or maybe acquires a five zero one mutation uh present in the in the uk maybe maybe more uh troublesome so in conclusion it has an increased incidence have become you know very frequent uh in in the california area and other areas in the united states um it's associated with increased transmission higher viral load or viral shedding and decreased neutralization activity of convalescent plasma and also a serum from vaccinated subjects to a something to some degree the other important i think information actually i actually took from a presentation that that uh was uh given by tom shimabu kuro shimabukuro from from the cdc copy vaccine task force as you know we have this when you're vaccinated you you give your information about vaccination and using the be safe and the report the virus there are a couple of reporting system they have accumulated 30 000 subjects that that became pregnant or were pregnant when were when received the either the modern or the physical physical vaccine so at least we have some information on 30 000 pregnant uh females um on this voluntary registry the be safe and the good news is that no there was no safety red flag no safety issue with with the the reception of the vaccine and pregnancy in fact miscarriage which was the most frequent uh event was present in 15 of these in this registry um but the background of the normal incidence is 26 according to what what's known here in the us so it's really no no significant um alert or or or any any safety signal regarding pregnancy which is which is obviously uh encouraging some other vaccine adverse reaction there was a publication in the new england journal of 12 cases of delay a large local reaction and you probably if some of you were here a few weeks ago we had a case presented of a delay reaction so so this has been now more officially recognized or reported this these patients had like a delay hypersensitivity reaction with the first dose which consisted of an induration in the area of injection and some systemic symptoms and you can see some photos of these um and this is not the immediate uh allergic reaction this occur usually eight days after the initial uh injection or after the initial vaccination and in fact all of these subjects went ahead and had a second dose and and as you can see four of them had no recurrence of the rash and the rest did have recurrence of the rash uh but it was not significantly more severe it was not more severe so so it's not a contraindication for the second vaccination but it's something that that has been recognized and um the authors mentioned that they did a biopsy of some of these subjects and they found changes consistent with a type 4 delay hypersensitivity reaction so this is not a taiwan histamine mediated it's actually like a like a t cell reaction to some of the components we we don't really know which of the components of the vaccines but it's something that has been reported and we even discuss a case of these in the uh in this echo session in this office hour section sessions and this is this is more a curiosity than anything else there was a case of a 60 year old woman who uh actually got her first dose and the day after the first dose fell uh really ill with fever uh weakness she was like falling frequently and i think she had a history of of an underlying malignancy and they decided to do because of her presentation they did a pet scan obviously not indicated with the vaccine but it's interesting that the pets can actually lead up in the shoulder where she got the vaccine and you can see the the bright area here in the arm this is the arm this is the neck this is the other arm uh there's obviously an inflammatory reaction or uptake of the of the radioactive uh glucose here and and also in the axillary lymph nodes which is logical and even in the spleen she had a um the spleen was actually brighter normally is less than the liver so that meaning that there's activity there's immune activity or immune activation after vaccination in the regional lymph nodes and the spleen it's just a curiosity that i wanted to bring and the patient actually recovered from her reaction but it was interesting to to that they you know incidentally did a pet scan on this patient and documented the different areas where the immune reaction or immune response to the vaccine is occurring so they saw the spleen the lymph nodes and obviously the arm where the injection took place finally there was um there was a study on rct on eyebrow meting as you know we have been discussing especially in latin america and some countries in europe they have been advocating for the use of hybrid mech team because of in vitro activity against kobe so a grouping in actually in colombia published in the jama the effect of ivermectin in on time to resolution of symptoms among adults with myocardia they actually treated over 400 patients and they found basically no difference in the time to recovery using already mechanism so a negative study well-designed studied uh it was double-blind randomized placebo control um and they were unable to demonstrate any benefits from iberocmectin any significant benefit from my hybermectin so um you know we will there so there are some other studies uh taking place but at least it's another negative uh piece of information regarding our hybrid mechanic that that that it was necessary because the other studies were not of high quality so this was a high quality story but negative result and the other point which i think it's one of the more controversial points is uh if the vaccines actually decrease transmission and we have talked about this and i wanted to bring um a couple of papers that that are already showing some of that evidence the first paper um it was a pre-publication actually is the siren study that i have presented here before the siren studies uh sort of a cohort of healthcare workers in the in the uk that they have been following and the siren published on their immune response to coffee et cetera and the risk of coffee among healthcare worker but in this case they actually evaluated real life effectiveness of the vaccine because the healthcare workers in the uk have been vaccinated and they analyzed the specifically those who received the physical vaccine and they found an 86 percent basic vaccine effectiveness in preventing both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections so it's one of the first um clear evidence that the vaccine not only prevents symptomatic but also asymptomatic this these subjects this healthcare worker had like a serial pcr of the nasa firing so they they were um followed to see they developed asymptomatic infection and they compared with the unvaccinated uh healthcare workers and there was definitely an 86 a very significant protection very close to the to the same efficacy that was seen in the clinical studies it was 95 in prevention of both asymptomatic and symptomatic um and also we knew some of that from the from the documents that were presented to the fda by johnson and johnson they had a table in that um in that dossier um that the johnson and johnson vaccine despite being just one dose they found a vaccine efficacy to prevent asymptomatic disease of 74 so so at least we we are you know accumulating more and more data that that that that the vaccines are conferring protection not only against symptomatic but also asymptomatic and asymptomatic it's important because it also decreases transmission of the disease by decreasing the the the asymptomatic infection and finally this this other study uh single dose of also the physical vaccine by dr weeks in which they actually analyze unvaccinated subjects and subjects 12 12 days post-vaccination and they found much less incidence of asymptomatic infection and not only that those few are the blue dots here those few that develop infection their city value was much higher meaning that they have a lower viral load than those who develop infection being unvaccinated or early after vaccination so apparently the vaccine not only protects against asymptomatic infection but also confirms um if you develop kobe you're going to have a smaller or lower viral load and that can probably translate into less transmission so so good news from the from the point of view of of the vaccine obviously there are still infections so the other analysis you can make is that yeah there is not a hundred percent and that's right so even after vaccination we need to continue the masking and social distance into some degree but definitely it's a it's it's uh positive data that we didn't have before with the with the modern and physical vaccines finally in the news there are a couple of of uh mentions of new monoclonal there's a new monoclonal uh by veer biotechnology and gsk jsk are presenting and they show that their monoclonal called br7831 uh decreased hospitalization about 85 percent so very similar to the to the band anima at the semi-map and the the general and actually lily also published the result of the place one and also confirming the the finding 87 less hospitalization and death in the press release we have to wait for the publication so there's more data accumulating on the benefit of of uh of these drugs to prevent hospitalization and death if given early um in in coping infection and finally um the there's an oral antiviral monopyra beer um that showed clearance of of the viral shedding in five days complete curious of viral shedding in five days and this is an oral antiviral and it's still on on the research by the face to a random randomized double blind control control trial uh performed by merck show that benefit and we're you know we would have to wait for the faith three and the publication of this trial but it's actually good news that this oral drug um is the first oral drug direct antiviral that can inhibit uh viral replication and also decreases the the viral shedding and hopefully will be associated with clinical improvement that's it that's all i had to share i know it was very long but i've been away for 14 days thank you so much duster that was excellent um leslie can you go ahead and introduce yourself and and go ahead with your update thank you sure leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine in espanola new mexico thanks mister that was really great and i am going to talk first about the copa vaccine and if it will help her aggravate lancovid symptoms hang on so patient came in to see me this week 46 year old woman she had coveted in october she's had really horrible symptoms since then multiple rashes including burning flaking dry skin in her ears which she just said is completely um making it hard to do anything brain fog headaches neuropathic pain in her scalp numbness in her left arm loss of taste she had loss of smell until a couple weeks ago and that finally has resolved um i had a visit with her this week and just out of the blue she said she didn't want the covid vaccine until her long covet had improved and since i personally i'm hoping everybody gets the vaccine i was a little bit worried about this so i tried looking up to see if there were any official recommendations on this so first thing is for nobody at this point actually knows for sure what causes long coveted symptoms i mean some of what we do if you had a lot of scarring in your lung related to pneumonia obviously that's um that but you know the brain fog uh the neuropathic symptoms the loss of taste and smell that persist we're not quite sure why those are there and i did find nih on fed in february just announced a new initiative they have 1.15 billion over the next four years to support research into the prolonged health effects of covid including figuring out what the underlying biological mechanism is so hopefully we'll get some answers on this at some point soon so i tried looking to see whether or not there was any actual data on this and i did not find any actual data so i'm a little embarrassed to admit that i'm citing facebook polls but that was as close as i could come to any actual studies on it so there were two informal polls one of them was cited in the u.s news article for some coped long-haul or symptom relief after a vaccine and a woman allison finley who has postcoded um found that her symptoms actually got better active vaccination so she just did a google form survey and she's gotten 68 responses 32 percent of the people who responded reported an improvement in their long-haul symptoms 53 said no change and 15 reported feeling worse so 85 did actually fairly well and just a small percentage worse and certainly a third actually felt better so this guy is guess or jazz i don't know how you say it medinger and he actually is a film producer in the united kingdom who developed long covet about a year ago and so he's gotten very interested in it and he had a youtube video posted on february 23rd um of this year and first vaccine reaction data for long covet and he actually for being a film producer he fully acknowledged all the limitations actually got someone to do statistical analysis on his data um he pulled 473 people on long hauler groups on facebook and slack going along with what we know about long coveted majority are female the majority are between 41 and 60 and the majority had had symptoms for 9 to 12 months he asked people about how they were doing two weeks after they're shot two weeks or longer after they're shot and the numbers were actually fairly similar to the other pull that 50 percent were at baseline after two weeks 27 were better five percent were almost well 14 were moderately worse and 3.8 percent were much worse so you know this is not by any means data but it's actually was kind of reassuring to me and i um sent this information to my patients and i told her i would recommend she get the shock this who knows if this will actually play out but people who got the moderator pfizer did better than people who got astrazeneca more people were claiming to feel worse after getting astrazeneca than after getting moderate or pfizer and then the other one i've actually been wanting to look this up for a while and elaine gush sent me an article this week that i'll include at the end from the atlantic but they talked a lot about postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or pots and i initially learned about pots when one of my daughter's friends in college developed it and it's a syndrome where people get very tachycardic and lightheaded when they stand upright no hypotension it's not the same as orthostatic hypotension they just get the fast heart rate it's believed to be a dysautonomia where the autonomic nervous system isn't functioning correctly and it was really kind of scoffed at i think up until kova just because it tended to hit young women and um those young women are often considered a little bit flaky and the symptoms of this are kind of um things that you know are thought of as a little bit flaky so i don't think it was really taken seriously but now it has really become clear that pots is much more common postcoded and there's definitely seems to be an association um with covet 19 and all of the dysautonomias but in particular with pots pots also occurred more commonly with other viral syndromes so the diagnostic criteria you need a sustained heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute or more than 120 beats when you stand up or if they do the tilt test so just basically check orthostatic vitals in your office have the patient lie down have them stand up and see what their heart rate does during that time it's also important that they not get hypotensive when they stand up if they get hypotensive that actually rules out the diagnosis they also should when they stand up and get the tachycardia they should have the symptoms that they were complaining of such as lightheadedness palpitations tremors weakness blurred vision fatigue and sometimes they may actually pass out because of their symptoms um and oops put the reproduction twice in there and then they should have absence of any other conditions that provoke sinus tachycardia such as anxiety disorder hyperventilation anemia fever you know all the things that normally cause um people to get uh tachycardic in addition they should not be taking any medications that could cause any of these so some of the other symptoms of pots are interesting because these are actually very common symptoms of uh postcobids so i thought i need to be screening more of my postcovid patients for pots to see whether or not this is what's going on severe long lasting fatigue lightheadedness with prolonged sitting or standing brain fog forceful heartbeats or palpitations nausea vomiting headaches excessive sweating shakiness intolerance of exercise or prolonged worsening of general symptoms after increased activity and pale face and purple discoloration at the hands and feet if the limbs are lower than the heart and treatment you want to withdraw any medications that are likely to make them feel worse increase fluids increase salt put them in compression socks and then exercise therapy but exercise therapy you can't just send them out to exercise because they're going to feel worse and actually the more i read about this it just seemed very complicated as far as how to encourage them to exercise so my recommendation would get somebody experienced in dysautonomias if you're going to have them exercise and then pharmacologic they talk about blood volume expanders fluid recording or desmopressin iv saline and they said you can actually some people will get an infusion of saline a couple times a week which i thought was interesting and then erythropoietin which i must admit would make me a little bit nervous to use for this heart rate inhibitors propranolol is actually the one i've seen most commonly used for this and then if the propranolol doesn't work a medication that i'd never heard of before called i have a braiding which apparently helps to slow down the heart and then purity stigma vasoconstrictors and sympatholytic drugs also work and then just a couple articles um that i oops thought were useful the first is um one that i mentioned earlier that elaine had sent to me um unlocking the mysteries of long-haul covet in the atlantic in april and this was an excellent article one of the best i've seen sort of going through long covered and they do talk actually a lot about pots in there which is what finally motivated me to look it up and do this then the second one actually is from last july and i came across this for another talk i was writing and it's on how do we prevent future pandemics and it was the best summary i'd seen of it and they pointed out it would cost somewhere between 20 and 30 billion to prevent the next pandemic and so far it's been over five trillion dollars that they think we've lost in 2020 from the pandemic so definitely worth preventing the next one if we can and that was all i had thank you so much leslie let's go ahead and go to marla marla can you introduce yourself and share your slides i'm sorry i'm going to try that again all right hopefully you can see my slides great yes we can alright so marla seaver is an infectious disease epidemiologist with new mexico department of health and i'm going to review some of the changes to the cdc guidance for vaccinated folks so you may remember a couple of weeks ago we talked about some updated quarantine guidance for vaccinated people and they updated that guidance last week to remove a piece that if you'll remember we talked about we weren't sure why it was included and this was the recommendation that people be exempt from quarantine if they were within three months following the receipt of their second dose of vaccine so that's been removed now that three month time frame and the new quarantine guidance does not contain a time frame for post vaccine so as long as you're fully vaccinated meaning you're at least two weeks from your second dose of the moderna or pfizer vaccine or two weeks from your j j vaccine you're considered fully vaccinated and you do not need to quarantine following exposure to a confirmed case however all of the other prevention mitigation measures should remain remain in place such as masking and distancing and avoiding crowds so there are some exceptions to this quarantine guidance for people who are in congregate settings and healthcare so here's two of the statements from the cdc guidance so if you live in a group setting like a correctional setting detention facility or other kind of group home and you are exposed you should continue to quarantine for the full 14 days and get tested regardless of your vaccine as your vaccination status or your symptoms and similar recommendation for hospital inpatients and residents and staff in long-term care settings so in these high-risk settings we have more opportunities for transmission and a more vulnerable population quarantine is still recommended regardless of the vaccine status so but once you've been fully vaccinated if you're not in one of these congregate settings there are now some additional uh things you can do so again fully vaccinated more than two weeks after your dose and continue all the other public health prevention measures when you're in public spaces but once you've been fully vaccinated you can now visit indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or physical distancing indoor visits between fully vaccinated people are thought to be of low risk so an example would be inviting other fully vaccinated friends or family members over to your house for dinner so you know emphasizing that you're in a private setting not a public setting you can also visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for developing severe disease again indoors without masks or physical physical distancing so indoor visits between fully vaccinated people and unvaccinated people are likely very low risk for that vaccinated person so an example might be inviting grandma over to dinner after she's fully vaccinated knowing that she might be mixing with adults and children in that household who you know some of whom may be vaccinated some of whom aren't however the risk to that vaccinated person is thought to be low in that setting if any of the unvaccinated people in the household are at increased risk for severe covet disease then everyone should take precautions such as visiting outdoors if possible making sure you're wearing a well-fitting mask and maintaining physical distance visiting with people from multiple households is a higher risk activity obviously and therefore all people involved should take precautions including wearing a mask physical distancing and visiting outdoors or in a well ventilated space whenever possible so you know one of the things in the cdc guidance that they sort of continue to emphasize is keep your gathering small if you're going to mix people from multiple households do it outdoors if possible and if you can't do it outdoors then people should continue mask wearing and distancing um you should continue to avoid medium or large gatherings um or partici and if you participate in social activities in public settings like going to the gym or dining indoors and restaurants even if you're vaccinated you should continue to follow all the precautionary measures wear a mask maintain physical distance avoid crowded indoor spaces and make sure you're washing your hands frequently so this was a pretty modest update from cdc about what activities uh fully vaccinated people can engage in however they did emphasize in a couple of calls i was on last week and over the weekend that we should be expecting additional changes to this guidance in the coming weeks as we learn more about vaccine effectiveness and as more of the population becomes vaccinated so keep an eye on these changes because we're expecting them to continue to be updated week by week and travel guidance for fully vaccinated people cdc is still really trying to hold the line on travel and recommend that regardless of your vaccination status you avoid unnecessary travel stay home if possible if you must travel they do recommend that you are tested prior to your departure date and obviously if you are infected that you not travel but assuming you have a negative test continue to wear a mask avoid crowds um you know your travel destination and um then get tested again when you return home so following um your arrival at home you should self quarantine get tested three to five days after your trip um and then obviously if you're if you test negative no need to continue that quarantine past the seven days if you do not get tested then you should stay home and self quarantine for a full 10 days after travel and if you develop symptoms during that 14 day post post-travel period make sure you get tested and isolate from others so again what hasn't changed recommendations for use of personal protective equipment by health care providers remain unchanged regardless of vaccine status so any ppe that you're wearing in a clinical setting when treating cova positive recovered suspect patients that recommendation for healthcare providers has not changed regardless of their vaccine status people should continue to follow the testing guidance at their workplace if you work in a place that is undergoing routine surveillance testing regardless of your vaccine status and even though you're vaccinated you should still continue to watch for signs and symptoms of covet 19 especially if you've been around someone that you know is sick and again if you develop symptoms you should be tested and isolate pending your results and then just a couple of links for further reading here's a science brief from cdc that kind of underlies their changes to the recommendations so kind of their rationale for the changes that have been posted so far and some additional reading for infection prevention professionals in healthcare settings thank you so much marla before i get into the questions i want to just ask cecilia thompson is on from tricor um if you have any updates from a testing standpoint before we get into the question section i don't have any updates but i'm happy to take questions great thank you cecilia and i i completely forgot to mention when we started about um our digital librarian kent is putting all sorts of incredible information that's being discussed into the chat i'm sure you've all seen it but please take advantage of that as well so um marlo i wanted to start with you just some questions came in while you were talking um eva anjali asked regarding visits at nursing homes could a vaccinated resident have physical contact hug with vaccinated adult family members yeah so there were some significant changes to the nursing home restrictions that are included in that second link in my slides for further reading i didn't go into today because they're quite detailed but the short answer is yes vaccinated residents can have indoor visitation with friends and family members regardless of their vaccine status people should still be masking you know performing hand hygiene but they can have touch and indoor visits with this new guidance after being vaccinated thank you and um when you were talking about congregate settings do college dormitories count as congregate settings yeah cdc did not include include college dormitories in their uh congregate setting guidance and it was something we actually talked about um here as well you know did we think they should be included um and and we were kind of split and epi rather we thought they should count as a congregate setting or not obviously uh most younger people are not going to be vaccinated yet um however it is a group which is at lower risk um you know for developing severe disease which is why i think uh cdc did not include them in that guidance um you know they have the ability to um you know come and go much more frequently unlike people who are really confined in those other kind congregate settings like jails or prisons um you know or nursing homes or other detention facilities so they're treating college dormitories much more like a private residence than a college setting in the current guidance great thank you and elaine um strothers asked with this quarantine guideline apply to public school workers i think she meant that one or public school people who work in public schools any different treated differently um i haven't looked at the most recent public education department guidance so i don't know if new mexico ped has adopted these quarantine recommendations or if they're retaining the old standard so i'm sorry i haven't looked at that to be able to answer great thank you marla and i know you answered this in the chat when jeff jeff miller asked about how people can start seeing more patients in um in person in their health settings and a couple of other people have asked i don't know if you just want to go go over what you do know and what's not known yeah not much has changed in the cdc guidance regarding outpatient care right now they still recommend you know using telehealth whenever possible if people are coming into the clinic in person make sure that you're screening them for signs or symptoms of illness or known exposures again regardless of their vaccine status and recommendations that uh healthcare personnel are still you know using all precautionary measures face masks um shields gowns and gloves when needed to protect themselves again regardless of vaccine status of those patients so this may be an area that we start to see some updated guidance as cdc kind of rolls these out and harmonizes these pages over the next few weeks but uh right now there hasn't been any updates to that guidance okay and one more for you um is there has there been any or any idea any new information about when vaccine will be available for younger 12 to 16 year olds there's a couple of questions about that i know that there are some clinical trials underway right now with younger folks and i have heard some people think that you know we may be vaccinating down to age 12 by the end of the summer um but i don't think we know for sure yet i don't know if uh dr sosa or dr hayes have other information [Music] any other information esther or leslie no okay um hair i don't see harry seibold are you still there i don't see you on my screen can you unmute yourself if you are i am here okay do you want to ask your question about the lily product because i don't know how to pronounce it oh holy moly you went uh way back to that one i gotta remember my question i wrote down so many questions on uh in there help me oh uh i was just wondering the lilly combination product does it have an emergency used to authorization and what are the parameters for uh for the use of that product versus any of the others yeah i think it does they added the combination now it's very similar to the other so it's uh you know more than 65 or more than 55 with underlying conditions so it's very very similar uh in the in the way the fda uh rendered the the eua for the combination and is there a difference or do we know have has there been a comparison between the regeneron the lowly products no i haven't seen a complete uh direct comparison they did compare with monotherapy or one of the monoclonals and it seemed to be you know better regarding hospitalization in in some of the studies but that's that's as far as i have seen just uh you know different doses of mono uh versus the combination and now the blaze one which showed the one that the news that i shared was 87 prevention of death and hospitalization in in early copies in patients with high risk of of severe calling thank you um there's a question by carol miller about since we she says since we know so little about the link the post-infect infection antibodies last is it helpful for people with antibodies to delay vaccination to learn more about the subject like the lifespan of the antibody and the protection of the antibody i don't know nestor if you know anything about that or bred anything no i mean the general recommendation is that even if you have antibodies which means that you have copied that you should be vaccinated because there's sort of a booster effect uh from the from the vaccine even if you if you have already circulating antibodies and in fact the data it's becoming more and more robust regarding the the degree of of increase in the antibodies after just one dose of the moderna or physical vaccine and those who are calling so they are governments i i mean i haven't seen anything from cdc or fda but i can give you a couple of countries have already uh instituted that that if you have copied or you have antibodies against kobe you only need one dose because basically to have another dose available for another person not because it has been studied in any in any uh formal way but it's it's just that because the reaction is so good we just want those if you had coffee before that that you know some of these nieces or health had recommended just one those um to have more doses for those who have not have kobe um harry go ahead i just realized you were actually asking about the other question i had put in there about the money pavior i had been hearing about this for a while now but i hadn't heard the name of the drug so i haven't been able to do any research do we know anything about this mechanism of action if there's anything else in that class and is it related to rheumatoid at all yeah it is a it is an inhibitor of the rna polymerase so it's similar to to um to rendezvous but not identical uh it's an oral drug we actually are about to to start two studies here in new mexico and at unm with uh the name of the drug used to be mk4482 so you're probably going to find a lot of more information with this mk from merck 4482 that's that's the name but it's now being renamed muno piravir and this is the first piece of information that i see published the fact that they they show that they're phase two study uh they they were able to show clearance of the virus in just five days in a hundred percent of the 49 subjects um so you know it's definitely encouraging we are doing two phase three one in an ambulatory uh patient that actually uh deborah and and dr paratha are gonna participate and and we are gonna do in the inpatient also so for both inpatient and outpatient recently diagnosed kobe uh 19 subjects uh we're going to use it and compared to placebo basically or or with obviously with the underlying standard of care of rendezvous dexamethasone for those hospitalized you have any ideas how long your phase three trial will last from how long it'll take you to do your data work up on that no it's probably i mean they're moving really fast but it's probably going to be six months at least to have some meaningful results because they they actually in at this moment they're actually in a pause uh they're analyzing the phase one and phase two data and they're gonna come up with the definitive dose for the phase three so it's in that um you know break between the two studies in order to continue with the phase three in the different areas and this is a multi-center multi-country study so it's not only here in the u.s they're doing it in many other countries in latin america southeast asia et cetera and in order to try to to gather uh you know the information quickly but my concern is that because the cases are going down it may slow down the the the enrollment of patients everywhere because of the of of the you know relative decrease in the number of cases in different countries so so we'll have to see wait and see but it's definitely encouraging because it's oral uh it's vid um seems to be well tolerated there's no like red flags with with what we have seen in the data so so it's really good news and and you know it's it's uh um you know bioavailable so you don't have to inject it like rendezvous or the monoclonals so but we have to wait really for the for the studies to be finished thank you nestor linda gorgos do you want to just meet yourself and just um talk about them go ahead thanks carly yeah i was just going to add that uh our site in santa fe through excess research will also have the outpatient treatment trial for mk 4482 they're also looking at a prevention trial so using this is an oral drug for household contacts to prevent infection so we're applying to be a site for that study as well and um you guys had already mentioned the the veer product the monoclonal antibody because of the interim monitoring board seeing clear clinical efficacy that studies now uh fully close to enrollment they are applying for eua and they're planning to additionally look at that product for im injection rather than having to give it by iv and the regeneron trial which is active here in northern new mexico again based on an interim data monitoring board review saw clear clinical efficacy and they have removed the placebo arm from the ongoing regeneron treatment trial so anyone enrolling now gets guaranteed treatment with monoclonal with the regeneron products so if you have patients who don't qualify under eua please refer them to us we would be happy to treat them and they are guaranteed to get monochrome as part of the trial thank you linda excellent um leslie loretta pierce is asking are we seeing pots in the elderly population postcode or is it mainly in young women um i haven't seen many case reports in the elderly but i've seen a lot in say uh 25 to 50 which is certainly older than uh we're typically thinking of seeing it so thank you and debra do you want to unmute yourself can you ask give a little bit more what you're asking about the chi cells yeah there was a new um uh i believe it was also emergency authorization for a test that um can test potentially for long covet and i'm just wondering if anybody knows about that or if that's something that's going to become available um in the future just to know if somebody's had covet in the past and to be able to to help to diagnose long covet although that's such a broad topic leslie or nestor no i have i have not seen that i'm going to look for it no i haven't cecilia have you heard anything about that i have not okay great well if maybe if something comes up we can talk about it um let's yeah there was something on um uh twiv by dr daniel griffin had talked about it on uh i think saturday great thank you um so olivia beckmann um marla asked if the travel recommendation state that number one is to get vaccinated does that mean that vaccinated individuals no longer need to get the pre and post testing no the recommendation is that even vaccinated people uh pre and post-test for travel great thank you and i just wanted to let everybody know that um that we [Music] that the cme link went into the chat of human about five minutes ago so if you would like see it to get see me please do that and we would love to hear hear and hear your feedback about the session as well there was a um there was a um question that was emailed in marley i think that you're the person that this should go to i think that what she was asking um because she doesn't have it sounds like she doesn't have audio or doesn't have isn't able to speak on online she says that if some people were able to get their initial vaccines and i think she's saying that they got them you know we heard about all these people going to amarillo if they were able to get their initial vaccine somewhere else how are they supposed to get their second vaccine so if you log into your profile on the vaccine registration website there is a little check box where you can say i've already received my first dose and so that will update your profile get you out of the bucket of people who are awaiting first doses and get you into the group of people who are awaiting second doses when you click that box it will ask you the date that you received your first dose and the product that you received so that your profile gets updated appropriately thank you thank you very much um and i think maybe wino or linda there's a question um from eva anjali are there any clinical trials in new mexico for kids less than 12. did you did someone answer that in the chat already yeah i i'm not aware of any vaccine trials through us i don't know if other sites have them the regeneron monoclonal antibody does allow enrollment of pediatric patients so we can actually enroll pediatric patients and we can enroll pregnant patients they have two different cohorts thank you um deborah hill do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question about ppe do you have a microphone um yes i i'm sorry um miss sivers answered it down below so i think we're good i just wanted clarification on one of her slides but i think i understand what she was saying now okay marla do you want to just for everybody's benefit talk about that yeah so you know there was a question about um ppe use for healthcare personnel taking care of confirmed or suspected covet cases um you know obviously a fit tested n95 is the gold standard for personal protective equipment but if fit tested n95s are not available cdc has described using a well-fitting surgical mask and eye protection as an acceptable alternative so eye protection like a face shield for health care providers and prioritizing those n95 masks for aerosol generating procedures thank you thank you very much um kim joy's asking wondering about what you know about italy's recent lockdown their that their their most recent lockdown have they had significant vaccine distribution or anything is it mostly due to the variance i don't know nestor if you've read much about what's going on in italy no nothing i know that the uk variant is very prevalent in different countries in the in europe and they have issues with distribution of the astra seneca vaccine but that's as far as i can tell i haven't really read anything specifically does anyone else marla or leslie or cecilia have any information or have any inside knowledge about what's going on in italy i do know that france at least they stopped distributing astrazeneca for a period of time because of the concern about emboli i don't think that was the issue in um italy but i it does seem like vaccine uptake has been slow in a lot of europe because of the fears around astrazeneca which as far as i can tell have not been borne out as true thank you leslie leslie um harry seibold was asking earlier about the definition of long covid i don't know if i mean you've been talking the most about this but i don't know if you can talk about what if there's now a clear definition of what when you can say somebody has long coveted um i i don't know for sure what i have generally seen is somewhere around three to four weeks out if people are still having symptoms that it's considered long covered and that we know that six months out ten percent of people are still having the symptoms of covid and the the it is so variable um between you know some people who have just you know mild lack of taste versus people who are still bedridden even from mild cova a year later so deborah do you you were shaking your head do you guys are you using a specific criteria in your post cover clinic no we're still trying to figure it out too it seems like the guidance is variable thank you and harry did you have your hand up and then i was going to type it in there so what do we name those people who were essentially asymptomatic but some period of weeks or months later then develop symptoms because i've heard some of those described as long coveted or long haulers so it just seems like a confusing term and set of terminologies that are not well defined so i do know that the icd-10 code that i'm able to use is postcoded syndrome so i don't know if that's eventually what's going to be you know because right now long covet does not have its own icd-10 code that i've been able to find so thank you very much um there is a question from dan saltman who who apologizes for missing a didactic but said are there any updates on the chinese subunit vaccine i don't know nestor you didn't really talk about that but do you have any information no nothing no i know nothing on the chinese i know there are two two vaccines but i haven't really reviewed anything from it all right and then um mark epstein says that he can address the t-cell test for a long haul mark go ahead yeah this is out of seattle it's a company called adaptive biotech and what they're looking at is uh the genetic material in t cells that that indicate for t cell receptor production uh previous exposure to sarge cov2 and so uh that i don't know how long after initial infection that takes to turn positive but it has high sensitivity and specificity you can do it at home or in a lab draw and cost 150 dollars great thank you mark all right and let's see we almost answered all of the questions i think i'm trying to see if there's any left um while i'm looking i just want to let everybody know that we have um upcoming a couple of upcoming cover 19 echo clinics the one is this afternoon at from two to three it's the first responder resiliency tele echo and they're actually talking about statewide efforts to address the opiate use disorder crisis that should be interesting um and then critical care is this week on march 18th um and the uh topic is going to be eric cry from our icu here talking about ecmo ecmo for covid um let's see and mary i'm interested mary mary lynch asked an interesting question she said is there a compelling reason to vaccinate children i don't know mary if you want to elaborate on that question a little bit um not really just that it just doesn't seem like the children get that sick overall as we look at it and is it worth risking something that we don't know a lot about and how it's going to be long term for children great thank you nester do you have any thoughts about that no i i mean marla can can also add i mean i think the only reason or the most compelling reason in my view is for the hurt immunity because if if you don't vaccinate children in in many places they're going to be you know 20 25 of the population still susceptible so the virus can you know continue to circulate and if especially if the protection wanes there may be elderly folks that can get it from from a child and you know you have you know the whole thing starting again so it makes sense you know once we demonstrate that it's safe in children to increase the percentage of people vaccinated as much as we can as much as it's feasible and safe to do in my opinion just to get that you know population immunity to a level that actually crushes the the circulation of the of the virus in the communities thank you very much and we just have a few minutes but there's a couple of two interesting questions and if we can't we don't have time today but we'll i mean if we don't get to them um about smell or taste um one is can anyone discuss the metallic taste after the modern vaccine how long it is supposed to last i don't know if anyone has any information about that i do not marla have you heard anything about that no i haven't heard that maybe we can look into that and then the other one is from cecilia died and says any info on on perosmia perosmia the rancid smelling aftermath of copen19 that has many concerned the smell training is really um fairly effective for that which is people get four smells that they formerly liked and twice a day they spend you know 30 seconds 15 to 30 seconds smelling each of them smelling vanilla and remembering what vanilla used to smell like and then smelling you know lavender or whatever are the smells they like and that one has actually fairly good evidence uh for treating it excellent thank you leslie okay we're right almost the top of the hour thank you so much everyone for coming and thank you for our experts and we'll see you in a week bye,,3/15/2021
41,welcome everybody can you hear me fantastic well welcome everybody to our office hours infectious disease echo i'm joanna katzman it's march 22nd i hope everybody is well i'm a neurologist i'm at project echo and and the university of new mexico and i'd like to just briefly introduce my colleague dr carlo thornton who's going to be co-facilitating with me carla are you there yeah hi joanna hi carla thornton here at e m infectious diseases and project echo thanks thanks carla um just some brief housekeeping items before we move on many of you know uh it's great to see all you uh with your cameras on if you don't have your camera on please turn that on if you can it's a really works in line with the echo model and develops a community of practice we have our digital librarian kent noseworthy who um is going to be putting evidence-based and evidence guided material into the chat and then in about 45 minutes after the hour you'll get your cme link and even if you don't need cme it is fantastic for you to fill that out we really do uh respond to your comments and thoughts as you kind of give us advice about this um echo and um we'll also be putting dr nester sosa and dr leslie hayes slides into the chat as well so without further ado i'm just going to introduce our chief dr nester sosa who's the division chief of infectious diseases at unm school of medicine and he's going to start us off dr sosa hi hello everyone thank you i'm glad to be here glad to be back um let me try to share my screen there you go big screen okay can everybody see my large screen okay perfect i got a nice color about the virus this week so i have a few interesting papers i'm going to go first i think almost everybody probably most of us have seen the change in the the policies from cdc and we can discuss this about the three feet versus three six feet in the in the schools um which is something that that i think a lot of people welcome that the fact that we can that we can use three feet instead of six weeks so we can open schools and actually wanted to bring the paper that i think they based the main decision although there are other papers this was recently published in clinical infectious disease and it was um this manuscript was effectiveness of three versus six feet of physical distances for controlling spread of coping 19 among primary and secondary students and staff this is actually sort of a retrospective study so it's not a very high quality study in my opinion they use information on on the plans on different districts in i think massachusetts and um they actually didn't verify that they actually did what they said they were going to do but they took the the word of the plan for it and then they look at aggregate data on cases on students and staff and then compare those schools or districts that use a three feet rule versus the six feet rule um and and that's what these stories about they actually uh they they studied 251 school districts um close to half a million students uh 99 000 staff and they they took a six week study period a very uh you know robust uh number of of staff weeks and and student weeks and staff weeks um in this paper and and the conclusion of the story or the main finding was that in those district that they use either six feet or three feet distance between students um in the hybrid model when they couldn't find any any uh increased risk of transmission uh both among students and i'm among staff so so the conclusion or the the extrapolation of the data was that it was acceptable to just a social distance of three feet and you can see that the policy by cdc changed after this and other another studies that have been published in other countries and this is the main graph of the study this is the case rate for per 100 000 in students and staff um depending on the under on the physical distance and you can see um like here this the staff have more cases they are out so they were they were they were more more cases but you can see that the two lines both the staff cases that use six feet and staff cases that you three feet and in blue were very similar actually inter winding each other and the same thing for students so they couldn't really during this period from from december to january they couldn't really see a difference between the schools or the school districts that use the three feet or the six feet rule which was reassuring for for those who support the use of three feet in order to open schools although that was a retrospective story i i remember this uh paper from june uh almost a century ago um a well-designed this was actually a retrospective i'm sorry this was a meta-analysis of 44 studies that actually correlated um risk of infection with sars in both sars and other coronaviruses and and physical distance among the the index case and those who got infected and you can see that that for different levels they use different levels of exposure depending on if it was a high risk intermediate risk or low risk exposure um you can see that yeah it's true and the and then in the in the uh x axis you can see the distance in meters so this would be you know close to three feet six feet and you can see yes that that in most of the risk uh situations the the transmission decreases uh you know between between uh being very close and one meter or three feet but it continues to decrease further so so you know it's not that like like three meters is equal to six in my i mean three feet is equal to six feet uh in my opinion with this um you know slightly better more comprehensive study but obviously it's a practical decision uh and and and one that i think is favored by a lot of parents that want to have their kids back in in some type of of uh physical um as opposed to just online schooling uh but this is i think uh you know really a sort of a controversial issue and this paper is actually a good reference to compare the new data with with the historic data and the other the other topics um that i wanted to mention it's a study from denmark you know that the the i love the scandinavian countries because they have this perfect data on everybody i mean they have like population base with a hundred percent of the of the population register in this electronic data and what they actually did in denmark was they they look at all the cases and all the tests all the pcr that they did in the country they identify those who got infected in the first search and they look if they got infected in the second search because they were able to follow them uh throughout the the two um very distinct um peaks of the epidemic in denmark uh so the this paper was actually the assessment of protection against reinfection uh with such kobe 2 among four million uh pcr tested individuals so four million tests in in in denmark in 2020 and they had to research and what they found is that the rate of reinfection uh during the second search was 0.65 which is like five times less what they saw in those who were not infected so when they calculated the protection they found a protection from infection and those who had a copied in the first search of 80 uh if you want to equate it to a you know vaccine protection so if you had kobe you had a efficacy you know of protection of 80.5 percent which is similar to we have seen in other in other publication i think i've discussed here the siren story from the uk was around 85 89 protection so this is what you should expect uh if you have copy you're gonna have a you know pretty decent uh degree of protection uh and the only exception and this is interesting in this population story they they stratified the the cases by age and they found that you know almost all the way to age 65 the protection was very uh you know constant 80 81 81 protection but when you are over 65 and this we have seen with other diseases your protection is less robust so 50 percent around 50 protection so this probably means that if you are over 65 and you have coffee you definitely need to get the the vaccination uh if not for the high risk because you're not going to be protected um if if you uh if you lose your immunity with time so so this is i thought it was a nice a nice um nice study um population based study to illustrate the protection from infection um the other and this is a big big question a huge question that we have been asking what is the level of neutralizing antibodies that correlates with protection when you're vaccinated and let's think of a hypothetical case you're an immunosuppressed person you got a vaccine uh and then you want to know if you're protected or not um so these this uh paper that i'm gonna describe and actually gonna show several graphs on this paper it's a fantastic i mean it's one of the best papers that i've seen on this topic and one of the first actually that tried to find a correlation between levels of antibody produced by vaccination and your your um vaccine efficacy okay so what they did they took um i think seven of the vaccines that are that have published their results of efficacy and they also look at the at the levels of antibody that they induce in the phase one and two trials you remember those bars a graph that i have shown and and they actually um correlated the level of of of antibodies um versus the the 90 95 efficacy of this vaccine and they also look at the duration of antibody and and they predict several things based on modeling that they did so let me go into the study this is a pre-publication uh for those who want to review it it's really an excellent paper and and the title is very very uh um i think you know creative they said what level is neutralizing antibody protects from coping 19 which is something that we don't know and we haven't really found there there's some second paper that i'm not going to review that are already addressing the same question this is a group they are all from from australia and and this is the most important although i'm going to show several graphs they uh correlated the neutralization titer over convalescent plasma and they did this because these different um companies uh and and clinical studies use different assays to measure neutralizing antibodies so what they did they divided the neutralizing antibody over convalescent plasma levels to sort of normalize the value or be able to compare the different vaccines so this is not absolute neutralization but how many times your your tighter is over the convalescent plasma that you stole the compression plasma tigers that you study so is it equal or two times or four times or maybe half of your convalescent plasma and then they graph the published efficacy and and compared to these to this relationship neutralization title versus complexion and and they had a nice non-linear uh graph in which obviously the mrna vaccines like pfizer here and moderna um and the sputnik that had a high you know over 90 efficacy uh they are several times over the the convalescent plasma and you can you can see this is convalescent plasma obviously one because it was the comparator and then you can see the other vaccines um the single dose johnson and johnson here giving you a 70 percent protection the astra seneca corona back which is a chinese i think chinese brazilian vaccine um so so in the future we we probably won't have to to if if you do a study and you you give me the titles of neutralization you can probably put it in this graph and say okay your vaccine is going to have an efficacy if you do a large study of 80 percent or 70 based on the convolution that's one of the values and in fact they found something really interesting that 50 50 protection is confirmed by only uh just 20 percent average of the neutralizing antibody convolution so if you can achieve 20 of your convalescent plasma antibodies you receive a 50 protection obviously if it's higher like in the case of of uh moderna and physic if it's let's say four times your convalescent plasma you get a 95 efficacy so this is this is what's important and also something that goes with what we are seeing that all vaccines is by having 70 percent 79 give you a very good protection against severe disease look at that 50 protection is confirmed by only three percent of neutralizing antibodies present in the in the convalescent plasma so so as long as you have some degree of antibodies neutralizing antibodies you're already protected against severe disease i'm going to see that that that's important for duration the other question that they try to answer and this is a use of modeling is well if you know your vaccine efficacy at the beginning you know the vaccine efficacy when are you going to need the booster which is a question that you have asked me many times and and using this graph they actually did the same thing so let's say your vaccine has a 95 percent let's talk about modern and physical 95 you're probably okay you're probably going to have still a 70 percent uh if efficacy uh out to 200 days um and and if if you if you think just of 50 you you still have protection over 50 percent of 250 days for any type of disease this is just any any disease and they went step forward and they compare efficacy against infection with efficacy against severe infection um and you can see that if you if you started with a with an efficacy of let's say 90 you're basically you know your your protection is severe this is going to be uh not eternal but very long lasting because you also have to take into consideration cellular immunity and all the things um and then and this is precisely that the duration let's take this just this graph if you have a 95 percent um efficacy of your vaccine for common disease okay after a thousand day you're probably gonna be around you know maybe 40 protection out a thousand days after vaccination but you're still gonna have an almost eighty percent protection against severe disease based on the modeling and the calculation and you can you can you know use any of the other um different efficacies and you can see how how long they predict that the protection at least the antibody levels are going to protect you from severe disease so that's also a good news and and the way even further they actually graph the if you have a variant which is also a relevant question that decreases your neutralizing antibody two full five full or tenfold you can use this graph to predict um to predict how efficacy the vaccine is going to be against the variance which is one of the questions that we're trying to answer so let's take this other paper and this is another paper that i i review uh was just published in which from a group of from massachusetts in which they did we have reviewed this type of paper they look at the full decrease in um neutralization with the moderna and the physical vaccine let me use the physio for example and let's say you want to know if you want to go to brazil on vacation and you get uh the brazilian the p1 infection how protected your physio vaccine that you got here at cvs is going to be for your for your uh for the season uh for to develop kobe you just go back to the curve and and you say okay i got a vaccine that is 95 efficacy it's affecting according to that graph more or less fivefold decreasing my convalescent titus against the brazilian so i'm going to be you know something around 69 protection okay so that's the way this this graph can use can be used to to uh predict the protection obviously we need to to this paper to be peer review and publish but it's very very interesting the way they they were able to to synthesize and and and discuss the data so that was that was that paper i strongly recommend you guys review it and it has it's a lot of information uh finally the the the last paper that i just want to mention quickly um and it's something that we have discussed how um diseases have been affected by kobe because of lack of access or people being reluctant to to comment and this paper was sent by a friend of mine victor ruthie who works in job hopkins he's a neurologist who specializes on stroker and joanna is going to like this this one so what they did they actually gathered the data from the state of maryland about strokes all types of strokes before the pandemic and during the pandemic and and and they they found interestingly enough a decrease in the acute steam ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack if you compare pandemic gear with pre-pandemic gear so there's obviously patients who are not seeking help we're not going to the hospital they were probably you know sort of suffering at home if you want because obviously there's no reason why the acute strokes and transistors have decreased with uh and these have been published and similar findings in other in other places in other countries and in other states so all strokes definitely decrease during the pandemic even the use of thrombolysis decrease only thrombectomy and some of the hemorrhagic strokes were the same so hemorrhagic strokes were the same probably they're more severe so people do go to the hospital but maybe the transient ischemic attack and some mild uh um ischemic strokes people are not seeking help and we're probably gonna have you know consequences of that moving forward a couple of case reports interesting case reports and i think leslie is going to mention another paper we both found different papers with the same topic they have reported already antibodies in newborns of mother vaccinated in the core blood of newborns of mother vaccinated so that was an interesting case before i mean it's not a surprise but it's good to see that the people are reporting the presence of antibodies after vaccination in in the babies um also there was a lot of you probably saw a lot of noise about the astra seneca vaccine and the pro association with deep vein thrombosis with cavernous sinus thrombosis and other thrombotic events well um there this is a report of deep vein thrombosis occurring shortly after mrna vaccine we know other explanations of this pro this is just probably a consequence of the inflammatory reaction that is associated with with more clotting or increasing in coagulation so it's probably not unique of the astral seneca but it's probably you know possible with other with other vaccines this is just a case report but it was interesting uh to see that it it happened with not with the astro senegal with some of the other mrna vaccine thank you that's that's it for today thanks thank you dr sosa wow that was a lot of information on many different topics so critical from school closures to vaccinations so many good questions to be able to ask you thank you leslie hayes dr hayes our primary care and addiction expert hi i'm having a little trouble with internet so if i um suddenly disappear i'll come back on without video because that seemed to do it so all right next slide so this first slide this first study was one of the more interesting studies i've seen in quite some time and what they found was that two percent of sars cov2 positive individuals have 90 percent of the virus circulating in the community which i just thought was so interesting basically these folks looked at data from fall of 2020 at the university of colorado at boulder they had more than 72 000 saliva samples of which 1400 were positive and they looked at the um distribution of viral loads within the asymptomatic individuals and they found it was pretty much the same it's what have been reported in symptomatic individuals which i thought was interesting and then um they said that regardless of whether or not they had symptoms just going by the viral load that you need to be contagious or infectious about 50 percent of individuals who test positive for covid seem to be in a non-infectious phase of the disease and just 2 percent of individuals actually have ninety percent of the virgins circulating within communities and they called them super carriers maybe they're super spreaders they were they did point out that we don't know if these folks are going to be super spreaders or not next slide so and i thought this was pretty incredible the the range was the lowest viral load that they detected was eight billions per milliliter the highest was six trillion burions per milliliter so almost a trillion fold difference in between highest and lowest and they measured it and i looked this up this morning so that i would be able to remember how they measured this and i've since forgotten and i didn't understand it completely anyway they started with using something that i guess is fairly specific and then they compared it to cycle time and they ended up using cycle time because that was cheaper and easier but they had reasonably good correlation between it so next slide and this was interesting they compared it to a data from a data set from symptomatic people and what they found was that they were roughly the same level of viral load in people who were asymptomatic and symptomatic which is interesting because to me i would have assumed that the curve would have been towards much higher viral load levels and the people are symptomatic but they did not find any difference between them if you look at the curve on the right they're almost identical the saliva viral load next slide and what they found when they looked was that just two percent of the individuals harbor 90 of the circulating virions and this is true in both the asymptomatic population and in the hospitalized population and 99 of the virions in a community are accounted for by just 12 percent of the asymptomatic and 14 of the symptomatic population which i just think is really pretty incredible so that means that 88 percent of the folks have less than one percent of the virus in the community um in both the asymptomatic and the symptomatic population there was one person who had such a high viral load that they actually accounted for five percent of the total circulating virions and on the other hand all individuals with saliva viral loads less than 106 which was about 50 percent of the infected individuals had less than point zero two percent of the virions in both populations next slide and if you look here um on the slide that's a little bit we can just look at the asymptomatic the curves are pretty similar that as you go through you get to 50 percent um the higher viral loads are on the left with the lower cycle threshold and so you have one person down there all the way on the left who had about 4.8 of the virions total in this study and then if you go out to the second one is two percent of the people and they are harvest harboring about ninety percent of the virus twelve percent of the population is harboring twelve percent of the population with covet are harming ninety nine percent of the virions and then when you go out to um 50 of the people um that's like 99.98 so huge percentage on that so i just thought that was really very interesting next slide and a couple caveats again they were very clear that it is not known for sure that viral super carriers are also the viral super spreaders and i'm sure everybody in here that was certainly my first um uh leap was that those have to be the people who are the super spreaders and we don't know that for sure although it seems likely and it's also not known for sure why certain individuals have higher viral loads they wonder if it could be partly due to where they are in the time course of covid but that's definitely not the only reason because people have been tested early and late in the time course and there are you know definitely peaks and valleys but um there are people who even when they're at the low end have way way higher viral loads than people who are you know at the high point of virus is it due to the immune response in the individual is it variations in host factors that support viral replication like the ace2 is it because of the specific viral variant infecting is it where they initially got infected was it in their eyes or you know their mouth does that make a difference and also how much viral load did they get on that initial infection so we don't know but it's it's really i just thought it was interesting things to think about next slide and then this one was not something i've seen anything about yet but i thought this was quite interesting they looked at 547 healthcare organizations across the u.s with a data set of 64 million patients and they had certain codes icd-10 codes that were associated with intellectual disabilities and there were 127 000 patients in that group with intellectual disabilities and of the total set um during the time period they were looking at 558 000 um or 0.87 percent presented with a diagnosis of covet 19. which i got to say for the time course they were looking at it surprised me actually that it was as low as it was but um next slide and what they found was that patients who had intellectual disability were more likely to be diagnosed with covid they were more likely to be admitted to the hospital if they were diagnosed they had higher rates of icu stay and they were more likely to die following the diagnosis of covin they also had higher rates of all other comorbidities other than cancer prior to coping 19 which no doubt contributed in addition people with intellectual disabilities were going to be more likely to be working essential jobs such as you know frontline in a variety of places they are also more likely depending on their level disability they may have more contact with home health aids and other medical people so they're going to be more likely to be exposed but next slide and this is really pretty hard to read but if you um this is the rate of death and this is not for people diagnosed with people or people admitted to the hospital this is just if you look at the entire set the people who were most likely to die from covid were people over age 80 and then people aged 60 to 79 but people with intellectual disability were third and this is just because of a combination of the fact that they're more likely to get it more likely to be hospitalized more likely to go in the icu and then more likely to die but they end up having really a very substantial rate of um death from covet 19 and this is not a group i've seen listed as a high-risk group anywhere and certainly i have not seen them listed as top priority for vaccines but it did make me think we need to be paying close attention to this group next slide and then last is just the case report that is similar to what nestor found guillen jones next slide and 34 year old multi-gravity patient working in healthcare received the mrna vaccine in the third trimester pregnancy she had been tested for a cova infection multiple times by pcr she had no known covet exposures all test results were negative and she also had a prior negative antibody test she had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and the baby's body the baby's blood and the um the patient's blood were elevated for stars kobe 2 antibody at a tighter of one to 25 600. so and just a reminder those antibodies are maternal antibodies they are not fetal antibodies so we are not giving long-term protection to the baby but um the protection generally lasts about six months so um hopefully um either uh covid will have gotten enough better we won't need to worry about it or they'll have approved a vaccine for uh the um infants um by the time these babies start to grow out of this but nonetheless they are going to get good coverage initially so and that was all i had thank you dr hayes uh so much as usual for your great uh for your great presentation i'm going to turn now to uh marla sivers i think marley you have a brother caesar sievers is our epidemiologist from the new mexico department of health and marla's been working tirelessly on the vaccination program recently marla thanks joanna so i just had one a quick update about vaccines for the group today you may have heard that we've expanded vaccine eligibility to all of group one so group 1a 1b 1c everyone in phase 1 is now eligible for vaccines in new mexico so that represents a huge portion of the population in new mexico that's eligible for vaccines so people age 16 and older that expansion of that whole phase one eligibility opens up about 1.62 million new mexico residents for vaccination and that's of the 1.68 million people age 16 and over who would be eligible for vaccine in new mexico so we reached an important milestone last week we've delivered more than a million vaccine doses to residents in new mexico and we continue to lead the country kind of you know back and forth between you know the top the first uh in vaccine distribution in the country uh sometimes dropping to second or third place but we're doing a tremendous job we've um used most of the vaccine that has been delivered in our state 94 of the vaccine that's been delivered in our state has gotten into people's arms and um you know we're delivering almost 100 000 vaccine doses a week and we continue to be on a good path for vaccine supplies delivered to the state with over 95 000 doses estimated to be delivered to our state each week so despite the challenges with people who are eligible for vaccine getting connected to appointments we really are using everything that we have available and able to expand that eligibility and so there's a couple of triggers that we use to open up the next phase so one is that at least 60 of people in the prior phase have been vaccinated so that's one metric we look at and then we also look at feedback from the vaccine providers if they tell us they're having difficulty in their county filling their vaccine events so that's a signal that we've exhausted people who are interested in the current phase with being vaccinated so we've got you know excess vaccine doses available in some regions and so that's a signal that we need to expand eligibility so we were able to do that last week into all of phase one uh folks so that's everybody who's been eligible up until now uh frontline healthcare workers people over age 75 people over age 16 with underlying health conditions and that does include people with down syndrome are included in that phase who are at risk of more severe disease but now we also after opening that up include all frontline essential workers and so people working in manufacturing people who are first responders you know people who work in grocery stores and people over age 60. so we've really expanded that to almost everyone in new mexico there's just going to be a small number of people um left who will fall into that phase 2 category who really don't meet any of those other guidelines under any of the other phases and so dr sosa yes we do have the johnson johnson vaccine in new mexico we have for a few weeks now we got an initial shipment of about 17 000 doses then we had a couple of weeks where we got no new j j vaccine but we are receiving uh several thousand doses of j j vaccine into the state each week now so those are being distributed thanks martha this is joanna where marla where is the j j primarily being distributed it's primarily being distributed in pharmacies so through our federal pharmacy partners so we've got four federal pharmacy partners in new mexico walgreens albertsons leadernet and i can't remember the fourth one but pharmacy chains so a lot is going to them and also our federally qualified health centers thank you marla and uh please still i i know marla's great to take answer questions so please feel free to chat in any questions to marlette as well as leslie and nestor uh thank you and then finally i'd like to introduce dr cecilia thompson dr thompson are you there hi i'm here yeah uh dr thompson uh works closely i'm at our tri-core labs with dr carissa culbreth and um i i don't think you have any lab updates today do you i don't have any lab updates but i'm happy to take any uh questions regarding testing fantastic fantastic well i'm gonna turn it over to dr thornton who's gonna start the questions thank you everybody thank you joanna i just want to make sure we got the vaccine question since that was just discussed um i have one question myself while i'm looking um marla do you can you talk about the incarcerated populations and access to vaccine so carla people in congregate settings including people in correctional settings people who are incarcerated are eligible in that phase one group so i believe they're under phase 1c great thank you very much it looks like and joanna asked about um are you seeing much vaccine hesitancy in any certain groups or what are you guys seeing right now yeah we do have some data um on our vaccine uh dashboard that breaks down a vaccination by ethnic group and ages um as a proportion of the overall population and so we are you know seeing um not really it's not classified as vaccine hesitancy i haven't seen any new mexico specific data about people um talking about their reason for not being vaccinated but we do have some communities with a lower rate of vaccine and are trying to target more resources in those groups but if you look at the vaccine dashboard you can see that broken down by age group and ethnicity thank you marla there's a couple more are you uh are college students without any particular medical conditions considered for in this phase as well since they're if they live on campus or live together so living in a congregate setting i think would qualify them i can read that closely and try to answer that question to make sure i'm giving you the right information but they may qualify under another category so they may be an essential worker for example um because they might work in a restaurant or a grocery store you know or some other frontline employment that would make them eligible if they weren't eligible um just because of their uh living in a college dorm great thank you marla and look and put that in the chat okay and leslie asked which adults are not eligible for vaccine at this time maybe that would be easier at this point yeah so it's going to be people who really don't meet any of those other requirements so um you know my guess is that it's going to be younger people who are not involved in frontline essential work um and don't have any underlying conditions younger meaning less than six younger 60 correct okay great thank you so much and there's one um question um lewis hershberg do you have i don't know if you have audio or if you can mute yourself and ask your question it's an interesting slightly complicated question yes hi um this is coming up we we certainly don't know uh about can you hear me yes we can okay uh we certainly don't know about the infectivity of patients who've gotten shots maybe they're all infected maybe they're not but when you look at the j and j shot or the oxford shot 25 percent of the people are getting mild to moderate uh i'm sorry asymptomatic to mild um covet uh and i would assume that if they're getting it then they're testing positive and based upon what you were showing before um you can have different viral loads this the symptoms of the disease don't really preclude having a large viral load uh versus the mrna shots which are maybe 94 95 effective in preventing the disease um i don't know if how we relate them and what does that mean certainly good that people don't get very sick and they don't die and you know that's obviously great but um how does that work out as far as possible infectivity in the future thank you thank you very much nestor i don't know if you have a comment about that and i mean you asked also does it affect is will there be an impact on herd immunity or contagion risk right effectivity yep sorry i couldn't i couldn't understand the question um carla yeah so he said if j and j and oxford vaccines are only about 75 percent effective in preventing covet and the mrna vaccines are 95 um how how does that impact i know we do not have final answers but if 25 of the people get asymptomatic to mild cobit will that affect herd immunity or contagion risk is that going to be a reservoir sitting around yeah yeah that's a good question i don't think we know we know the answer um you know for for once we don't know exactly um you know the the percentage of protection from asymptomatic viral chatting uh we don't know if those vaccines despite the fact that they are not 100 or 95 percent do they decrease the viral load so we don't know that if they they make a person infected but not that infectious uh so that i think there are too many questions but yeah i i share your concern it is logical to assume that if if you're 70 uh preventing a mild disease and not 95 there's going to be more people uh more people with a mildly symptomatic infection that in theory can be passing on the infection to others but i think at the end because we're going to have uh you know all these different vaccines around at the end i think we're going to we're going to be able to to achieve her immunity and and and even if those vaccines are less than perfect we'll will be able to to achieve the goal which is basically to to flatten the curve and make cases really infrequent but it's true i think there's a concern for for her immunity vaccine is not that protected i agree in our area for instance they're giving the j and j shout out to the teachers police that people who have a lot of contact and they're specifically saying well we're going to give you the j and j shots i don't know yeah um i just want this leslie i just wanted to add i just put a i put it in earlier i'll put it back in a link to a youtube video which specifically addresses this and i found it very helpful for explaining sort of why we shouldn't compare them and why it was still okay and i mean as um nestor said we don't have the answers to a lot of the questions but this really helped clarify it for me so great thank you leslie um nestor back to your study the study that just that you described about the three versus six feet um dr seibold was asking was the study looking at symptomatic cases only in that study or was that a symptomatic spread as well no i think it was just report of cases in the i mean case reports in the state of massachusetts so they didn't go into details about you know asymptomatic and it was just that were registered among the students and staff of those districts school districts but they didn't go into detail and again this this is sort of aggregate data so they got the data from from the department of health it was not like they were following these kids nor were they actually measuring the distance of the kids in the school so those are like sort of limitations of the story they just took the plans and they said okay this district plan was to you know to use three feet as uh as the distance this other district used six feet but they didn't actually go into the school 251 schools to actually measure they were implementing those uh the only positive thing is that presumably all of the kids were masking um so that was that was you know sort of and following other other uh preventive measures on top of the three feet so so that's what they they said okay it's probably the same uh but there's obviously some limitation to the study uh in that regard great thank you and um i'm not sure if you know anything if you know about this but um john foster's asking do you have any insight why the reinfection rate in manaus brazil appears to be so high no there was actually a sort of an editorial i think in lansing about about that and there are several hypotheses but they don't know and i have talked to a couple of brazilian colleagues um you know and the question is because there was a study that showed a very high positivity rate in my house there was a study based on on sort of prevalence using blood bank donors and they found that it was more than 70 so that's almost heard immunity so how can you explain uh an outbreak a horrible outbreak that is occurring in brazil if you already had her immunity and there's several hypothesis one that is that that study was not accurate that it was not really 70 percent but maybe lower 40 50 percent uh several prevalent so there's still half of the population susceptible the second is obviously the back the variant you know the concern that the p1 billion that it's prevalent in brazil maybe escaping immune control um even if you had it you're gonna have a reinfection because you the the p1 variant is it's different enough from the original uh vaccine uh so so yeah so they're they're very and the other thing is waning immunity if you had the disease in march you know you're probably not gonna be protected uh a hundred percent you know nine or or ten months after that the initial infection so you can be reinfected just because of waning of immunity so there's sort of a whole group of hypotheses that could explain what's occurring in brazil at this point and and uh and for that matter is occurring in europe there are european countries that are going into the third um you know lockdown the third wave despite initial vaccination effort and despite having two two waves uh uh in in 2020 and the beginning of 2021. thank you mister um this is open for uh marla and nestor and leslie um does anyone know if a 61 year old has a reaction to the pfizer the first visor shot will they still have a greater chance will they have a greater chance of reaction to the second shot cutaneous reaction i assume that i can i can just say a few i i presented i think the the local delay reaction there was a paper in the new england journal reporting the 12 cases of like this local erythema that occurs more or less five to eight days after the injection and interestingly enough in those twelve patients there were four if i remember correctly that didn't have a reaction on the second time around so it was just with the first but surprisingly enough it was not worse and i think none of the 12 had a worse reaction they had a similar reaction or no reaction at all with the second dose this is different from immediate allergic reaction and actually the cdc that's one of the absolute contraindications if you had an immediate meaning less than four hour allergic reaction either anaphylaxis or angioedema right after the initial dose you probably should not get the second dose because uh it is assumed that the risk of having a more severe allergic type one reaction is higher uh but that's different from a delay you know erythema or or soreness or some some other local uh delay type of hypersensitivity reaction thank you and i just wanted to let everyone know that the cme link just went into the chat um if you're interested in seeing me please fill that out and also we would love to have your feedback and i'm going to turn it over back over to joanna great thank you carla um elaine gush had a question i believe about the astrazeneca vaccine nester talking about she said the last thing i heard about the dbt after a vaccine situation was that the analysis showed the rate was no higher than the background rate i'm wondering if you might comment on that since a lot of the european countries are using astrazeneca and i think the us is even sending some of their astrazeneca out to other countries yeah i think that is correct and that was sort of one of the conclusions of the ema of the european medication agency um but i'll give you my take this is a personal opinion i'm not going to reflect what they they actually analyze the events that occur are somewhat rare i mean it's not just thrombosis thrombosis there was actually uh venus thrombosis of the of the cns so so the the there's probably something there obviously it's not a lot of cases or very few cases and and i agree if you just you just say okay thrombosis is the same incidence as the general population so nothing really to worry very very rare event like the anaphylaxis i mean it's it's undoubtedly these mrna vaccines the the mrna negative are associated with anaphylaxis uh but it's a rare phenomenon it's one in you know x number of millions of vaccinees will get a severe reaction but it's somewhat for me as a clinician it's somewhat unusual uh to have a cabernet venus thrombosis for a healthy you know 65 year old or 50 year old who gets a vaccine and then you know a few days after that develop this rear weir so there's some countries that are are like you know hesitant to to put it in younger patients because they were this phenomenon were absurd mostly in younger female patients there's actually um i saw a news from from norway that they found circulating auto auto antibodies uh associated with these phenomena so i think we need to learn more but it's definitely a rare event um with with the astral seneca and with any other vaccine but there's something you know unusual about the event and that's why they stopped the using the vaccine until they were able to gather more information because it was somewhat unusual it was a dic phenomenon with low trouble with all platelets uh and also thrombosis in weird places it's not just your regular dbt that anybody could have it's actually you know thrombosis of this cavernous sinus in the brain so it's it's sort of you know you know unusual right uh nestor thank you uh thank you for that definitely i'm getting a having a venus uh sinus thrombosis or a deep vein thrombosis um in the cns is certainly uh sometimes a little more worrisome than having a dvt in the leg absolutely um cindy johnson is asking about cindy actually might you be able to unmute and ask your question about the different vaccines and efficacies yes so i've been on so many of these echoes and one of them they have talked about the johnson johnson vaccine and the reason for the lower efficacy the 66 versus the 95 and it was an international echo that i was on and they had said that it was studied in a high rate of variance and that brought down the efficacy so if it had been studied in the same population as the pfizer and the moderna it might have been up in the 90s as well but you couldn't compare it it was apples and oranges because of the variants that it was tested in so not to discount it as not being you know as as effective as the other two messenger rna vaccines so i just was wondering if anybody else had any information on that as well i think thanks cindy great great comments and nestor can you come possibly comment on that yeah i absolutely agree uh actually when you uh de-aggregate the efficacy uh and you take out like the patients who were enrolled in south africa and patients that were enrolled in brazil the efficacy of the of the johnson and johnson is slightly higher than the aggregate results so it's true um so so yeah i think uh the both the south african and the brazilian decrease the efficacy from 10 to 30 percent of the vaccine so when you when you include in the analysis patient from those countries your overall efficacy is going to go down so totally agree with with uh with cindy it's it's absolutely right um you know and and that's one of the reasons why the fda for for the u.s approved the johnson and johnson and and i think they're close to approving the the astra seneca also the astrosenica uh show over 70 percent efficacy here too in the us uh not as high as 90 but at 100 prevention of severe disease in 23 000 patients in the u.s so so we'll probably see in the next few weeks uh a more robust discussion on astrosenica for the u.s also nestor this is joanna you know one of your slides that you had that's showing showing the length of time that the vaccine is effective or the neutral neutralizing antibodies are effective it seems to kind of drop at about 250 days almost 300 days for mild disease at least and it made me wonder if the pharmaceutical companies might be thinking of kind of a yearly it almost fits right in line with a yearly booster that might just continue to kind of get the variants that are most uh you know most uh virulent if you it you know or or what you're are you thinking along the same same lines as i am on that i think yeah i think at some point when we achieve uh you know a very high percentage of the population that question is gonna it's gonna start going up in the in the priorities of people now we're like you know looking for vaccinating people for the first time at least once you know at least with the with uh with the first those but yeah i think uh and i think still is also we have i haven't seen that many stories of duration of protection after vaccination for obvious reason because you know vaccines have been around for such a short time but i think after six or seven months of of uh massive vaccination in israel here in the u.s and the uk we're going to have like nicer decay curves because what i showed was actually a model this is based on modeling from those australian scientists but we we can see and we will see a long-term duration of antibodies uh and and we can probably correlate better uh when the when the booster is needed if it's needed when it's gonna be it's gonna be after a year after two years when we have more information and the other thing that i always remind uh people and this is um something that i have heard from several immunologists remember the t cells and the memory b cells i mean we're measuring just antibodies in an assay because it is it's relatively easy to do but most of these studies are not taken into consideration cell mediated immunity that can be long-lasting so hopefully even if you have sort of a decrease in the in the antibodies you still have that background on you know of t cells that remember the virus and will protect you at least from severe severe disease and can also boost uh if you're exposed to the virus you can get a booster and probably not develop severe disease if you have memory b cells in your bone marrow uh so that's also important to remember that that antibodies are important but they don't tell the whole story of the immune immune protection against the virus thank you nestor and dr there was a question about t-cell immediate immunity and and the effects on that so thank you nester for that um lynn colemoyer asked a question lynn do you want to unmute and ask your question about patients with schizophrenia yeah just a quick question i i just read that it was the second highest risk for mortality after age and i can't find any mental health questions on any of the qualifications for vaccinations for my patients marla do you do you have any insight to that possibly yeah i agree the only um question i see on the registration website is for uh conditions like dementia are the only ones that are specifically called out schizophrenia and other behavioral health concerns or mental health conditions are not included in the list of conditions for being high risk that's really really interesting yeah yeah um and there's a question from tamara flies that says what's the projected date for 16 and over with no risk factors to be eligible and i think that's a every state i think i would say is different and marla might you mention that for new mexico yeah i did we did have some information up on the website at one point that you know projected late summer early fall um for really to be open to anyone who wanted a vaccine but a lot of that just depends on how much vaccine we receive in the state and um how much demand we have for the currently eligible groups great thank you um and harry seibold asks um i thought um he's wondering if um maybe nestor or leslie you might know this um that if uncomplicated asthma alone increases or not but the the risk of severe covet infection i'm going to leave that to leslie no i actually remember a study in which uh there was no correlation between asthma and severe disease uh but i i that was just one headline that i read maybe four or five months ago when we were looking for the for risk factors uh asthma itself especially young people were not uh was not associated with someone but i don't know i i don't remember there are other papers i haven't reviewed that topic sorry no thanks nestor i have yeah exactly what nestor said that from everything i've looked at it doesn't seem to be a severe risk factor would you like to comment on that oh i just wanted to comment that um michelle harkins who you know her that's her specialty is really asthma so she's given a talk on it recently and there is no clear evidence that it that it causes worse that it um yeah associated with more severe disease thanks carla and pamela defern also um reiterates that too uncomplicated asthma is not a risk factor um she she mentions that too very helpful thank you and then serena bacca says is there data on what the infection rate of the homeless population is um and those with mental health um issues and i'm wondering that if anyone on the network knows about that or where they might get that or leslie if you've been um i know uh heather brislen was working a little bit on that as well um so maybe that's a that's something that we can look into for next week as well um any last comments from from marla lester nestor or leslie carla any last comments i can let everybody know that there's um there's going to be no first responder echo today it's spring break um that there is going to be a hiv um special echo this week i believe on wednesday that we have a climate change echo it's the fifth in our series this week on climate change and mental health wednesday morning at 10 a.m mountain time also talking about climate change in agriculture um and we just can't we had just a few too many amazing questions today to get through all them but we'll continue to kind of keep a record of all of them but really appreciate everybody's joanna one other thing nestor do you want to um talk about the conference for those who speak spanish you're on the call the sure for those who yeah we're gonna have uh actually in spanish and portuguese on saturday uh we're gonna have a conference of all the uh uh places that do echo in latin america we're gonna have a conference on kobe uh in general also how the experience of the countries we're going to have a presentation by mexico by brazil by uruguay on on how have they been impacted by the pandemic dr ray nosov which is an assistant or or an advisor to the president to president biden is going to be there is one of our keynote speakers so it's going to be a great um you know it's saturday saturday morning i don't know if we can we can place the the invitation on the chat but it's going to be a great and it's going to be both spanish and portuguese so either of those we're not going to have translation to english because it's just for for for uh latin america but it's going to be a very interesting session saturday morning it starts at 9 30 if i remember correctly uh mountain time i'm wondering if kent might be able to put the link link into the chat possibly yeah and if that doesn't get into the chat you can go to the um to our echo website and it should be on there as well great um the cme link also went in right at about two minutes before the hour once again great thank you everybody uh thank you dr man okay thank you bye,,3/22/2021
42,can you hear me all right okay fantastic welcome everybody to the office hours infectious disease office hours for march 29th my name is joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm and i'll be facilitating today's session i think we have dr sosa dr hayes marla sivers and hopefully also dr carissa culbreth on today wanted to welcome you all back thank you so much for your great participation i see so many uh faces on the line and if you have a video camera and don't have that turned on it is perfectly all right to eat and drink for many of you it's your lunch hour or break and um perfectly fine to do that while your video is on just a reminder that kent noseworthy is our digital librarian and he'll be putting just so much information in the chat evidence-based evidence-guided material that you can copy and paste and save that um for later on put that into your own browser at 45 minutes after the hour we'll have the cme link for you and even if you do not need cme or ceu credits it's always great if you can fill that out so that we can know how we're doing and improve this program uh very thoughtfully as we we meet every week uh finally the slides we've been uh happy to be able to get the slides to you each week and elena martinez will be able to post that into the um into the chat during the session as well so without further ado i'd like to um introduce dr nestor sosa who's our in our chief he leads the infectious disease service at the university of new mexico school of medicine dr sosa can you hear me well joanna nestor i can hear you really good okay perfect all right so let's let's get started so okay so the first uh paper that i want to present is somewhat of a surprise to me um i saw in the news um a communication of this drug proxolutami which is actually an androgen receptor inhibitor a noble androgen receptor inhibitor that that had been studied for metastatic cancer and and um well you will you will see the news um it showed like a dramatic 92 percent decrease mortality for kobe in a headline so i i was curious about this this drug and i wonder if it's a new hydroxychloroquine that is going to be deflated when we see the paper or is it really the uh the magic bullet that we've been waiting for so let me show you some of the data so this was the news disappear in the european pharmaceutical review which is like an online news uh outlet and and uh the headline says at all pro proxy lutomide reduces copying it mortality by 92 you know taking into consideration that rendezvous reduces the mortality by zero percent this is 92 percent better right at least the the the headline so what they what they reported in this in this was the the preliminary result of a phase three trial uh in in brazil in 12 different sites in brazil and this story according to the news outlet is a double-blind placebo control so well-designed study in different sites in brazil with you know around 600 patients um grouped in two cohorts because this is an androgenic they wanted to study in males and females separately but overall they found that the 14-day mortality of this patient was extremely low 3.7 percent versus extremely high in the placebo group 47.6 so almost too good to be true um and the hospital stay was shortened by almost 10 days five days in the treatment group 14 days in the in the placebo so that that's all the information they gave the name of the two investigator i look at the at the clinicaltrial.gov and in fact this this trial is is uh it's uh listed there and presumably the the result is going to be available complete results going to be available in april according to the clinical trials of gov so that was interesting so i look even further and i found this article by the same author flavio cadagani um and andy goran um who who uh actually published a smaller study also double line placebo of proxa um accelerating viral clearance and and reducing time to clinical remission this was published in february in an online online journal and the the the way and you may be asking as i did what is an androgen uh receptor blocker uh you're doing doing in a covet trial if you remember and this is sort of reviewing a little bit of the of the basic science for the virus to enter the cells it needs the ace receptor which we know is a well-known h2 receptor but in order to attach to the h2 receptor there's a there's an enzyme a serine protease called tempress or tam prss2 tempress actually uh modifies the spy protein and makes it more available for the ace receptor to be able to join so these two are key for the entrance and it turns out that the androgen actually is the only known um promoter of the production of temperatures in the nuclei temperatures mrna and then tempers proteins so so theoretically blocking blocking this activation of tempest production they're going to be less temperatures in the cells and thus less entry of the virus into the cell so that's like the the leading hypothesis and the study that that was published this is the one not the one from the news but the published story was a double-blind randomized placebo control 236 patient adults with positive pcr mild covey less than three in the wo show scale so patient basically ambulatory patients and they were offered the proxolutamide 200 milligrams for 15 days or until remission of sentence or placebo or a machine placebo and they found a faster clearance 82 percent of the patient in the prox arm had cleared the wire loading the throat versus 21 and there was also a significantly shorter time to remission 44.2 days recovery for the proxy versus three weeks basically symptomatic for the placebo so this was the basis for the large trial that that i saw in the european news outlet so we have to wait i think we have to wait for the publication of the phase three but it certainly looks promising um this is not a retrospective trial like like it happened with the with the hydroxychloroquine this is a placebo control so at least it's better uh designed so we really have to wait but it's really impressive the the the way this drug seems to be working let's see what happened when we do larger trials we move the center multi-country trials with these uh with this new uh it's a non-steroidal uh androgen receptor blocker okay so that was interesting and then from the fancy new drug to a really old drug aspirin this is i think that one of the first studies actually testing aspirin uh in kobe this is a retrospective what it was it was a retrospective story um out of um centers here in the u in the in the u.s in which they look at at the patient that were admitted and given aspirin either because they were receiving it before uh or because they had some indication for aspirin and they compare retrospectively the inhospital mortality intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation and and and they actually found um that those three markers were significantly reduced in those who were given um or were started on aspirin in the hospital and this is not a prospective trial again this is a retrospective chart review so there's a lot of limitations a lot of variability between the the two uh i mean the treated and untreated subjects or the the aspirin and non-aspirin subject but it was interesting and intriguing finding and and obviously the explanation that the authors postulate for this effect is the fact that we have seen um pulmonary complications associated with thrombosis in the micro vasculature of the lung so it makes sense that you know we have we already have seen that anticoagulation or prophylactic calculation helps so this anti-platelet engine may also help um in this in this process and this is basically the forest plot uh of indicating mechanical ventilation icu emission where all better or less less risk of of having these three outcomes if you were in the aspirin arm than you if you were in the in the asp in in the non-aspirin arm and these are the reduction more or less a 50 reduction of all across the board for these three uh three risk factors and the kaplan-major survival core also mortality benefit for us between the blue um and and the yellow are the aspirin and non-aspirin respectively so so interesting this is a retrospective trial we need to do a prospective trial now a large prospective trial to see if it really you know this simple inexpensive readily available drug like aspirin can make a difference in patient severity i presented last week the the study on the three feet versus six feet um opening of school and i criticized a little bit the methodology uh so i was glad to see that there are there were two publications in the latest mmwr with much more data real-life data on opening schools uh one of these um and it's sort of a lengthy complicated story but they actually look at the data from florida florida actually opened schools in the latter part of last year and and what they demonstrated in this in these in this story which was sort of a study of all the schools that opened in in florida was that while they had an increased number of total cases these purple bars reflect total number of cases in florida there was not a significant increase in the cases in children 5 to 17 and school related what they call in this study school related cases in children also 5 to 17. so you can see the both lines blue and the dotted blue lines are flat as opposed to increased cases in the community so you know the conclusion of the authors of this mnwr is that despite the opening of the of the schools there was not a significant proportion of kids affected as a consequence of that although there were cases obviously school-related cases and there were you know outbreaks in some schools and closures of schools because of these outbreaks but overall if you look at the whole state uh it was it was not um significantly impacted and actually only one percent of the kids in the whole state became infected uh from uh from a school school uh related case so so that that is somewhat reassuring and then there was a more smaller but much more intensive study in utah in which they actually uh found losers kobe transmission in elementary schools in salt lake city they actually um studied 20 elementary school in depth they did like really really close um contact tracing and even genomic studies to see relatedness and they actually found um a very low secondary attack rate for the cases in schools only 0.7 percent if we compare it like the attack rate in a home is like 22 to 30 percent so this is really and these were schools that were using only three feet apart and obviously we're using masking and and suppressing some of the extracurricular activities so it was um sort of taking several of the precautions that are recommended but definitely a very successful outcome with only 0.7 secondary attack rates uh in in these 20 elementary schools in salt lake city um and this this is also very well designed studies so i think with these two studies plus the one you must have use it i think um there's enough science to to at least with some precautions open this up in the schools and that's sort of the conclusion and and what i think is going to be recommended moving forward um i just wanna one of the biggest big questions that we still have um with the vaccines obviously the vaccines are excellent preventing severe disease practically all of them but the question that is still lingering is can the vaccines prevent asymptomatic transmission which is actually a surrogate marker for i'm sorry as asymptomatic infection which is a surrogate marker for transmission um and there's more evidence i have presented before some evidence to that this was a study published in clinical infectious disease impact of kobe 19 vaccine on asymptomatic infection among patients undergoing pre procedural copy 19 molecular testing so this is in the setting of a health care system i think it's the mayo clinic these authors because they do pcr testing on everybody who's going to have surgery or general anesthesia or some other procedures they actually capture the moment when some of these subjects were vaccinated a few days after vaccinations and other that that were not still vaccinated and they compare if if the if those vaccinated had less or more uh infections asymptomatic infection because these were basically detected by pcr without symptoms and they found overall after adjusting um that um right before they got the second dose there was an eighty percent so only one one dose of the of the physical vaccine in this case 80 reduction in asymptomatic transmission so very good um you know reduction overall of asymptomatic transmission in these um this retrospective cohort study um which is similar to what we have seen in other in other publications at least with the mrna vaccines and this is as i said only uh right after the the the second dose so so you know it's probably even better if if you wait the the full two weeks after the second dose which is when when the cdc considers that you are fully uh vaccinated so you know promising although you can if you're a pessimist you can say okay there's still a 20 transmission uh at that time so yeah it's true there's still some transmission and that's what we are emphasizing that even if you're vaccinated you have to still take some precautions but nevertheless shows that the uh you know a decent uh prevention of asymptomatic disease and thus probably impact on transmission the other big question that we have been asking and it's something especially the patient that are suffering from from long covet and now long copy has a i think the the they're working on this official name post-acute sequelae of sarcoby to infection pasque so that's how i think the the final uh nomenclature of the of the long cover is going to be pasque uh i just learned that over the weekend so the question is are vaccines safe in patients with tasks and there was um one publication and we have made this comment before but there's one publication precisely addressing our vaccine safe in long copy um it's a prospective observational study this um it's out of bristol in the in the united kingdom they had a cohort of patients uh that were initially hospitalized with kobe and were left with with basically with long covey they had been followed at three months after hospitalization and eight months and they have persistent symptoms and they were vaccinated like like many other people in the uk were vaccinated so they took a sample of 44 vaccinated lung-covered patients and 22 that have not been vaccinated and they compare what happened to their to their symptoms overall to their um quality of life using this sf 36 uh score and and a mental well-being also score used in the uk and they and they um evaluated and see one month after vaccination for those vaccinated or a similar time for those unvaccinated subjects they compare and and the good news is that number one um among the unvaccinated more people more subjects have worsening of the symptoms than the vaccinated so the vaccinated deteriorated less or have persistent less persistent symptoms and in fact there were more resolution of symptoms 23 in the vaccinator versus 15 in the unvaccinated um and no significant differences in the in the score so at least we can we can conclude at least from this small study of just 44 and 22 subjects that the vaccines didn't make them worse and if anything improved some of the symptoms in some of them and you can actually see it graphically here so worsening symptoms is in yellow unvaccinated on the left vaccinated on the right you can see there's more yellow on these um on this graph on the unvaccinated and the vaccinated actually a couple of the vaccinated symptoms improve and also um yeah more improvement more blue on the vaccinated than the unvaccinated so interesting at least uh you know the first evidence that that people with long copy or patient with low coverage can actually be vaccinated uh safe safely and and and if in some cases they may even improve their symptoms and and just to finalize only one article on variance i always try to bring these variants but unfortunately this is this is a this is an article a very uh negative article in in the results it's an article from brazil and as you know brazil is experiencing right now a very um uh huge search with a lot of mortality and the worrisome um was the this paper was really worrisome is southern rice in kobe 19 case fatality among young and middle-aged adults in south brazil after identification of the p1 variant so what they did these authors actually looked at the mortality or case fatality rate of of sars before so in january and how it changed when the new variant was actually introduced in february and you can see i put a red square to to highlight the most important finding in those age 20 to 29 30 to 39 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 there is an increase a significant increase triple or double increase in the case fatality ratio um uh for for those a group of relatively young subjects so so and this is you know apparently blame on the on the on the variant basically because they actually look at some parameters to see if they could find an explanation this was obviously a statistically significant so there was an increase in order the group 30 was more marked in the 20 to 59 and you can see this is the case fatality rate uh in the less than 50 and you can see that how you know in some groups uh like this 40 to 49 um 30 to 39 naturally increased the case fatality rate and in all the groups basically but it was marked more marked in the in those younger younger group and this cannot be explained by an increase in the number of cases and like overwhelming of the health system because precisely when that uh peak of case fatality right here in red occur the cases were coming down so this is cannot be blamed on like you know lack of of oxygen tanks or lack of ventilator because it was actually um sort of the downward trend of the curve and when they noticed uh this increase in the number of of uh or fatalities uh especially in this younger group so so really worrisome news from from brazil and we're seeing in other places where this this variant it's uh becoming more prevalent at least energetically they're describing a higher mortality even in younger patients so something of concern okay that's it for me today thank you master i thank you nestor i think you covered almost everything that i can think of and more so thank you um we have lots of great questions that i think will wait till we get through all the presentations next up is leslie hayes our primary caring addiction expert from espanola hi leslie hayes here and i had a couple patient issues come up last week and it took me forever to come up with an answer to them so i thought it might be something other people were coming across the first was a 70 year old woman or woman in her 70s she was exposed to a family member who is positive for cobiad um she has a chronic cough and she stated it was a little bit worse but she pretty much felt fine she'd received the first pfizer vaccine in january and the second in february she was positive for cobit by both the rapid antigen and the pcr test her risk factors included diabetes hypertension and age and i was like do i offer her ant monoclonal antibody even though she has had the vaccine and i wasn't sure nobody in the clinic was sure and it took me quite some time to find it i eventually called carla who confirmed my answer and the cdc basically says yes if you go to their page on vaccinations interim clinical considerations for use of covet 19 vaccines they state for vaccinated people who subsequently experience cupid 19 prior receipt of a cova 19 vaccine should not affect treatment decisions including use of monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma antiviral treatment or corticosteroid administration or the timing of such treatments so i did refer her and um i don't know if she has gotten it yet and then this one i was not able to actually find a good answer to and i made nestor and marlo promised that they would give an answer because um i couldn't find the full answer do fully vaccinated people still need to quarantine for uri symptoms with negative cobit testing so this was a woman in her 60s fully vaccinated came into the clinic for routine follow-up i asked her how she was doing and she said oh i feel fine other than i've had nasal congestion and sore throat and a mild cough with some swollen lymph nodes for three days um coveted rapid antigen was negative pcr was negative so the question was was this person still need to isolate and i scoured google and the cdc website and i could not find an answer anywhere i looked at who i'd maybe somebody better than me at google can find it but nobody answered this specifically and um what the cdc said was you should so watch out for symptoms of covet 19 especially if you've been around someone who is sick if you have symptoms of cod19 you should get tested and stay home and away from others but they did not answer what happened then if that testing was negative so my gut feeling was in a green county with a vaccinated patient and really pretty vague symptoms i didn't feel she needed to quarantine but i was hoping to get some input from people who are smarter than me about this and then next i don't know about the rest of you but i keep having patients come in saying well i don't want to get the vaccine yet because they're only giving whatever i want to get specific vaccine it's always something different and this is really a wonderful article and this would be one i would encourage people to actually read because it really specified why we cannot compare the vaccine trials and they said that multiple variables between the trials that make them hard to compare and the randomization is intended to assure comparability of groups within the trials but it doesn't do anything for comparing between trials so there's variations in the study population some trials excluded patients with pre-existing conditions and for instance novofax reported that their vaccine was not as efficacious when they included hiv infected individuals and the oxford astrazeneca trial um found that they had good efficacy in patients who received a half dose in the initial immunization but this was only for people age 18 to 55 and so obviously that's important zero positivity status um initially the mrna vaccine trial in the austro oxford astrozenica excluded participants in their primary analysis with their serial positive at baseline or without baseline serologic results and people who are seropositive but baseline will likely um be factored into future trials but right now we don't know for sure the answers on that and then presence of variance obviously is going to have a huge effect on the vaccine efficacy intensity of epidemic may have contributed to the differences in efficacy the number of infectious challenges and how high an inoculum virus people are getting maybe higher in places where the population density is greater or the epidemic is more intense non-pharmaceutical measures such as masks may have had an effect case definitions vary and then um looking at asymptomatic mild moderate severe and critical um what they found was the definitions really differed between the trials and i forget which one i think it was moderna actually gave um people in their trials and o2 sap monitor to take home and um what they found was that the um there were a higher number of people with low o2 sets in the modern which was not surprising because they were measuring that and then there were also different criteria for testing in the trials testing with mild milder symptoms is going to identify more cases some of them tested only for more severe symptoms and um one thing to realize is while the efficacy results have varied for any symptomatic disease the efficacy results against severe disease have been pretty robust for all of the trials and then they also said as standards of care improve people are going to be surviving longer so as we get further um and do um more vaccine trials now the mortality is going to be less in the trials and then i thought this was really the most important point and i actually quoted them directly on it that the ultimate success of a vaccination program is measured by the ability to prevent disease and not by individual efficacy in some ways we don't care how much it prevents disease in any individual we want to make sure it's preventing disease in a population so vaccines that are moderately efficacious against disease enable to reach large segments of the population because of greater supply single dose formulations improve delivery characteristics or greater acceptability will yield substantial public health gains so i thought that was probably the most important thing that i got from this article but it was a i thought a very interesting article and then lastly this was just my favorite headline this week new mexico's covet 19 vaccinations are outpacing new infections 72-1 so and i thought that was pretty cool and that's all i have thank you dr hayes so much we now have marla seavers who's one of our state epidemiologists working primarily on the on the covet pandemic marla has some vaccine updates for us hi thank you joanna hi everyone i wanted to give a vaccine update this question came up last week and i answered it and there's been some changes since then so we are currently on track in new mexico to open up vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 years of age or older next month in april so our continued progress towards this goal obviously is dependent on the weekly vaccine allocations we receive from hhs but things are looking positive that we'll be able to expand the vaccine eligibility even even more and open it up to everyone who'd like to be vaccinated by next month so i wanted to just take a moment to recognize the efforts of our vaccine program the vaccine planning group the national guard our pharmacy and fqhc partners and our hospital and healthcare system partners that have really made the successful rollout and this progress possible the collaboration among providers and the public-private partnerships in new mexico have really been outstanding um one other update starting this week people age 75 and older no longer need an event code to be able to register at a vaccine site so to get an appointment at an event lots of feedback from partners and the community about how difficult it has been for those older adults to respond quickly enough to that event code to be able to secure an appointment because the events you know tend to fill up within a few minutes of the announcement so people age 75 and older will no longer need an event code they can log in to their profile and if they meet that age criteria we'll see just using their confirmation code events at times and locations in their area and they can choose the site and the time that works best for them so hopefully that will be again that will allow us to reach more of those folks that have had a lot of difficulty getting into those vaccine events and so we continue to work with the aging and long-term services department and the unm office of community health to also help overcome some of the technological challenges for those groups get them registered by phone connected to vaccine sites in other ways and then lastly i just wanted to mention there was an mmwr published today on interim vaccine effectiveness uh preventing sars kobe 2 infection among health care personnel and first responders so this is a study that involves eight u.s locations it's the heroes recover study it's a longitudinal cohort study that started in july of 2020 and the vaccine effectiveness portion of that study began in december december 14th so when vaccine first rolled out to frontline healthcare personnel and extended through march 13th and the participants in this study filled out a weekly uh symptom profile and also were swabbed weekly looking for sars cov2 infection and there were about four thousand participants in the study that were included in the final vaccine effectiveness analysis so more great news about vaccine 63 of the people in the study received a pfizer vaccine and that just really has to do with the timing of that vaccine being rolled out first and these folks being in group 1a and being vaccinated very early but what the analysis found was that people who are fully vaccinated in this group so more than two weeks after their second vaccine there was a ninety percent reduction in infection so this is not just symptomatic illness but actual stars cov2 infection among fully vaccinated folks and uh people who had received one vaccine and were at least two weeks past that initial dose were 80 percent less likely to become infected with sars kobe 2. so this is uh you know great additional information about the effectiveness of vaccine to prevent infection and therefore both symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission thank you thank you marla fantastic i really hope that these great vaccine studies can be highly you know publicized to get those that are a little bit hesitant or on the fence to really want to get in you know get vaccinated thank you marla so much um there's one question mark i wonder if you might address that was from dr eva anjali who works on the inpatient side at unm she says when might we see vaccinations available for hospitalized patients so i think you know if patients are hospitalized for a reason other than sars cov2 um and they don't have some of their contraindication to vaccine you know there's no reason that people who are in patients could not be vaccinated now or vaccinated prior to discharge thanks marla so much um and we'll come back to you if we can for for questions in a moment i just want to briefly introduce dr cecilia thompson who works alongside dr uh clarissa cobra that tricore lab cecilia are you there yeah i'm here i i don't have any updates or announcements but i'm happy to take any questions regarding testing fantastic thank you cecilia i'm going to just move to the top of the chat questions we've got a ton of questions today and i want to get started right away the first is from dr hayes and it relates to dr sosa's um the first to study which was the androg the study related to uh i can't uh pronounce that first drug uh yeah but yes something like that and proximal it's called proxima okay good um is ant and and unless he said is androgen affecting the tempress too at all related to why men do poorly with covid it could be i don't know it's probably one of the reasons yeah right right right right irene schauer says but i think meant that men would do much worse than women if this drug really helps that much so really good point from irene um and um so uh diana rodriguez hertado one of our partners in peru asks um what is the dose of aspirin and nester i believe it's 81 milligrams cester i think you're muted yes sorry sorry it was retrospective so they didn't give the those but when they look back the median dose was 81 right so it was like a baby aspirin or a small asp brain exactly but most patients were receiving thank you so much okay great so uh and it's uh interesting given the the relationship with the clotting and uh vascular diseases as well so then we had a number of questions regarding the schools and interesting regarding the the data from florida and utah dr sosa um and uh peggy spencer says related to these school studies but how do um how do they know that kids weren't asymptomatic spreaders and dr harry seibold um kind of asked a similar question do you have any ideas about that nestor or leslie yeah in in the case of of utah which was a more detailed more interventional study they actually tested all the kids that had contact with the positive case regardless of symptoms so they did a real like intensive contact tracing isolation uh and in those positive they even do genomic studies to to make sure that the strain that they got the the you know the secondary cases got was similar to the original case in the case of florida was more of a of a general data type of thing i mean they look at the number of cases in the state the number of cases in kids in a certain age and and they call school related cases to you know to patients who have been in school and became became infected but in fact they were not sure some of those cases could have happened in the community but they generalized it to make it easier to analyze but in the utas they did they did the whole thing even even genomic wide studies to to to establish a relatedness of the of the virus in the outbreaks fantastic and so it sounds like dr seibold is asking did they trace back and see what if there was increased transmission in families and it sounds like they did that yeah they did and they found some secondary cases especially in the utah they found secondary cases at home definitely in in some of those uh transmissions but the the the message was that transmission in school was lower than than in the community and lower than and the attack rate was lower that would have been described in other settings like congregate settings nursing homes um even family regular household transmission it's much higher uh than than the 0.7 attack rate which is very low and and actually in the florida was interesting because they they were able to they tried to to see the the settings where the transmission occur and there were you know there were some outbreaks i mean there were outbreaks and even school closures and some of the largest outbreaks were related not to the school's activity but to the sports related to school activity there was like an outbreak of 56 cases related to a wrestling match uh and and you know very high numbers and also with football 17 i think and 18 cases were the number of cases in in the outbreak so so obviously extracurricular activity social gatherings related to school opening are risk uh risky activities more than the being in the class three feet with the mask that seems to be less of a risk than the other things that that occur around school uh like sports and and and social gathering and they point out to that in the in the paper thanks nestor very interesting as we you know get i'll get back to school um thank you for that uh dr lawrence carrion says any reports of increased rates of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in florida and or utah and that the cdc reported over 2500 cases in the u.s before march with 33 deaths i think he's i think um lawrence you're alluding to the fact that as school goes back into session might there be more cases of mis yeah in these two papers they didn't address mis at all i mean these were epidemiological not clinical cases so so they didn't make any specific comments uh i have heard obviously of of more reports of mis in some states but this is anecdotal in podcasts and things people are as i said i think previously that they're paying more attention to to the younger groups because now that they are the unvaccinated you know in some states will be the unvaccinated or vaccinated at the end uh so so we're probably going to be at least we're going to pay more attention to cases in kids multi-inflammatory symptoms in kids and even outbreaks in schools and and other where younger people congregate because they're not vaccinated basically thank you thank you nestor um and i i'm wondering does the brazilian variant seem the most severe right now in terms of increasing morbidity or mortality or is or is because the case rate is so high in brazil and it is so transmissible right now is that why perhaps it seems like it has it really increases the morbidity immortality what are your thoughts on that nestor right i mean there are some publications also about the uk variant being more uh problematic more more i don't want to use the word lethal but more severe um so yeah at least these two variants have some publication this is the first one that i've seen on the brazilian i mean there were a lot of anecdotes i i have some brazilian friends that are making the you know the anecdote anecdotal comment oh my icu is full of young people now i didn't see this in in march so so those type of comments but this paper definitely supports those those anecdotal reports that they're seeing are in fact i can tell you the anecdote and this is something that it's it's a public knowledge in my in my country in panama they reported the first case of of the brazilian strain and and it's a family of three and two are in icu and these are young people thirties in their thirties so the husband and wife are in icu only the five-year-old kid is not in icu it's doing okay but the two parents who went to brazil and came back to panama are both critically ill and they are healthy young um you know young couple so it's it's really striking uh the the severity of these uh btcs uh nestor could you tell us about um the vaccine how is that how are the vaccines working against this variant you think you're muted nestor okay let me just share my this um can you see my slide yes so this is uh this this was a study actually um i think it's in the pre-publication but they they took patients or subjects that had received the mrnas vaccine uh one or two doses of the of the pfizer or moderna and they actually um this is more of a you know like illustration more than a this result but these are sort of the neutralization effect of one dose in pink two doses in red to the different variants so you can see like all the way up to probably uh the california strain here the four to nine the neutralization is pretty decent okay for for the for the vaccines with all these this strain so this is the the wild type the wuhan original one the d64 this is the uk in purple this is the one of the california variants at 429 but then when you start going into the brazilian these are the two brazilians train p1 p2 this is south africa they're really low they're almost as low as the neutralization effect over sarsko e1 so the 2002 and other while corona viruses so so really you know the the neutralization power of the vaccine seems to be uh lost with with p1 and with uh with the south africa and the brazilian for short so so that that that is what we know that there there's definitely a drop but this is obviously neutralization it's not taking into account t-cell response this is always the the caveat and that and and it's not a clinical study so you can still have uh prevention of severe disease even if if you had these variants but we we don't know we have to to to wait uh for instance the data from brazil or south africa with the with the mrna vaccines and see if they're protecting against severe disease but at least from the laboratory standpoint there's a drop there's a significant drop in the neutralization capacity of the serum of those vaccinated against this new especially the p1 and the south african strains okay thank you nestor do you know are those i know i'm just asking you questions but i think people want to hear this are are these strains being looked at readily in the in new mexico and throughout the us right now do we know where it's you know what the rates are of this variant i i don't know about the the variant i mean it had been reported like sporadically in several states uh and and here in new mexico at least we do have a pretty strong group working on on on doing genomics i mean so and and i see cecilia is doing we have daryl we have the two daryl's here at unm we have the um people at the national lab supporting and doh so so i think we are looking at lisa in our state we are looking for variants and they do i have seen this beautiful graph with the different variants circulating in new mexico uh so yeah so we are we're monitoring that i don't know if cecilia wants to add anything because i saw her she was naughty and i think it's important yes yeah i i would just echo nestor's comments that um tricor is working with all of our partners including the state lab to send positive specimens for sequencing so we can monitor these variants thanks cecilia um thank you so much for those great that great and showing us that slide that was really a helpful review um elaine gush dr gush uh reminded us about the case that leslie presented and i'm wondering nestor if you or any others want to maybe uh remark on that clinical question nestor yeah this especially the second patient the one that fully vaccinated that has respiratory symptoms um has a negative test i mean the risk of that person having infectious code in my opinion is very low because first because she's vaccinated so at least she has some degree of protection from her two vaccines and then on top of that she has a negative either pcr or antigen which translates into a very low risk control admission so so unless you know something else is is going i wouldn't advise her to quarantine you know tell her to be careful but i wouldn't force her to be at home for 14 days or for 10 days because she has a negative test she's fully vaccinated she's fully immunized uh so i think the risk of her transmitting to other people is probably not zero but it's very very close to zero it should be very low that's that's my opinion even i haven't seen that statement clearly written in any but i think the risk is low because you know the the chances of her having transmissible copy is probably less than 20 and then on top of that you put the the fact that she has a negative test uh if if he was done at the right time it's also a strong negative for transmission thank you nestor um i'm wondering about it if if alexandra cazares wants to unmute and ask the question about her case 73 year old female alexandria i'm here yeah can you hear me yes so yeah so i have a 73 year old woman who she has minimal medical problems but um maybe she's on a little bit of gabapentin but she had her vaccine and a week later she got diarrhea tons of diarrhea kind of mild abdominal pain super fatigue didn't eat for six days lost six pounds she still has loose stools feels really fatigued then she's due for her second covet on wednesday she never had kovid she wasn't she and her husband don't go anywhere her husband wasn't sick should you get it no yeah i i mean my opinion this this is one of those cases that you have to really individualize you know severe prolonged diarrhea is not a common um reaction to the vaccine it's definitely not an allergic immediate allergic reaction so um i would give her the second dose i would try to study why she's having diarrhea see if i can figure it out uh but i i mean i in you know without seeing the patient my my recommendation would be to to to give her the second dose because the you know the protection that the two vaccines confer are probably greater than the risk of having her diarrhea you know worse so so yeah so i would say yes but obviously it's you need to injure individualize this this out of uh routines situations right or unusual situations uh one one concern for me would be that does she have kobe but you said she had very rich very small risk factors for for that thanks nestor leslie do you have any thoughts on this case yeah just what nestor already said which was that i would definitely think about testing her for covet i mean even if she you know doesn't have any risk factors i have definitely heard of people getting covered while getting the vaccine you know that was the only time they could have been exposed so right yeah and just to support the the first case that that leslie presented i mean if you have a person even if it's a vaccinated person with coffee and has risk factors and i would wouldn't hesitate in giving them the monoclonal if it's in i mean if it's indicated otherwise because of the risk factors and you can always if if they're missing the second dose you can always put the second dose later when the half-life of the of the convalescent um i'm sorry of the monoclonal uh antibodies we're off which is around three months you can put the second dose later if need be but if if you know if i have an 80 year old with kobe even if they got the first dose i would just offer them the the monoclonal to try to decrease hospitalization and severity like like nothing has happened and you know like an unvaccinated person i would give it to them and and then you know think about the second dose later but after she fastest this this kobe crisis will think about when to put the second dose and probably i will just space it three months to wait for the half-life of the of the monoclonal to wear off and i can then give her the second dose and get that booster effect um that's what i would say i agree thank you um also while we're on that topic marla was i ended up talking to marla about it and um if you could just comment what you were telling me about the cases that there have been a breakthrough covid among vaccinated people just because i thought that was interesting yeah sure happy to and plan to talk about this more next week where i have some more data and some slides i can share but you'll remember that several weeks ago we began routine surveillance for um you know post uh vaccination infections so people who were beyond you know two weeks after their second vaccine who went on to test positive um and the numbers i have are a couple weeks old now but through our surveillance we had identified i believe 117 vaccine breakthrough cases again not unexpected we expect that some people who are vaccinated and then have exposures will go on to test positive so far that number has been low that we've picked up um through this routine surveillance um and none of those cases have been attributed to a variant of concern um so they've just been sort of you know the normal virus so that's reassuring um and again it's a small number thank you marla um and we're looking forward to seeing more data on this i really appreciate that um jeff miller says he has a patient in the hospital with significant guillain-barre syndrome with the only known risk of covet vaccine um about two to three weeks prior and the hospital neurologists are anecdotally stating that they've seen uh seen and heard cases they believe are related to covet and wanted to see if you've seen any supporting data on this either marla cecilia leslie or nestor or or anybody else for that matter that we've seen you know with the influenza vaccine and other vaccines that can cause guillain-barre yeah if i remember correctly in the trials there were a few cases uh and they were um there was not an imbalance between the number of cases of the ambare in the vaccine and placebo arm there were like four and two four and one uh so so you know so respected for the number of subjects that entered the study and for the time that the study lasted but it has been reported with with uh kobe with natural infection uh and i wouldn't be surprised if it's reported also with vaccine but it's an infrequent really infrequent event and it doesn't seem to be much more common than the general unvaccinated population or placebo arms that that's as much as i can say and that's what i have heard too nestor um and then cami mckinney has a question do you consider a person who was tested positive with the rapid antigen test yet negative with the pcr test on the same day positive or negative for covid19 where can i find supporting documentation on how to determine which holds more validity hi this is marlo sorry i put uh answer to this into chat and um there's an algorithm that cdc has to try to sort of help uh make this clinical determination when you have these discordant results you know part of it depends on the clinical presentation of the patient and then also your pre-test probability when you go to this link and you first look at the algorithm it seems very daunting and overwhelming so i would just tell people sort of stick with it because as you read down it kind of walks you through using the algorithm and that can be quite helpful thank you uh cecilia do you have any other thoughts on that yeah i would agree with uh marla that um cdc has algorithms um the in our experience the antigen tests have been less sensitive than a pcr test great thank you um we're getting we're getting close to near the end of the hour pamela de fern um this talks about the local pollen counts related to this is the time of year when we all get seasonal allergies and patients have uris and so it can be difficult to assess symptoms for uh symptomatology for covid versus uh you know regular uri symptoms and i know we had a problem uh kind of with that last year um diana rodriguez her tattoo says what was the worst adverse event after vaccination and the frequency um nestor or uh or marla do you have any kind of data on um you know what have been the kind of the more uh serious vaccination reports either in new mexico or kind of cdc reports from the us i mean for me the i mean i i really don't know for sure which one is the most uh i guess the life threat the immediate life threatening and a philanthropic reaction would i would put put number one that have been clearly associated is an infrequent event you know one in in millions but but it's it's there for both of the mrna vaccines uh i would say that that's the most uh severe uh adverse event that i have read about but i don't know specifically there are any other um i remember earlier in the vaccination in finland there were the report of 13 frail elderly subjects who die shortly after but i think the autopsy reports and things are not being published to to say they were in any way associated with the with the vaccine um but that's what i would say allergic reactions immediately reaction i would say are they more severe right now and nestor this is joanna has there been any more data on the um central on the central nervous system venus thrombosis from the astrazeneca or um no what i have seen published are more like uh explanations of what happened there's a description of these uh trombocytopenia and circulating autoimmune antibodies are trying to come up with like the pathophysiology more than anything although astro seneca and some other uh people have really said that the frequency is so low that is similar to what you expect to occur in the general population but uh um in those specific cases that that that reaction occurred there was sort of a dic-like picture with thrombocytopenia and and and other specific findings and they're trying to figure out the mechanism and i i saw a german researcher um pre-publication talking about about uh um autoimmune antibodies and and that they could explain the thrombocytopenia uh something similar to heat to what we see with the heparin induced from bosaropenia or dic so they're trying to figure out the explanation for this phenomenon that i think are probably going to be related to the generation of immune reaction to some component of the vaccine that cross react with with platelets or something along those lines but i think we need to wait to see more complete story of the of the explanation thank you nestor i just might ask uh leslie or marla or cecilia if you have any last um thoughts before i let people know about other echo clinics this week okay um wanted to let everybody know that we have a first responder echo at two o'clock today mountain time in just an hour it is about um resiliency in psychiatric emergency rooms and the high incidence of methamphetamine and how to take care of it and kind of enduring this year with the kind of increased substance use disorders throughout the state of new mexico and around the country and that's at two o'clock on wednesday at 10 o'clock mountain time we have the seventh of our eight week series in climate change and human health and that we have this the dr john balbus who directs the national institute of environmental sciences talking about extreme weather events uh like the weather event we had in texas a few weeks ago and the head and paul schramm who leads the climate change and health program at cdc talking about disaster preparedness that's wednesday at 10 a.m mountain time and then on thursday morning we have the critical care echo with michelle harkins and then thursday at 12 noon we have the substance use and chronic pain um echo so the the cme is in the chat at 45 minutes after the hour and it just went into the i think it's going into the chat again right now the slides are in the chat as well and thank you very much uh for participating and for being a great network with us and we'll see you all next week and stay safe,,3/29/2021
43,office hours tele echo session we're really happy to see everybody today um i just have a couple of quick announcements before we get started with our presentations uh my name is carla thornton i'm one of the associate directors here at project echo and i'll be facilitating this session along with my colleague joanna katzman who i don't see yet joanna are you there yes oh hi there hi everybody yes i'm joanna katzman here from project echo and unm welcome thank you joanna uh we just ask everyone if as usual if they have a camera to turn it on we'd love to see your faces if you have a camera and you can turn it on during the session we would we would very much appreciate that if you have questions for the hub team members during the presentation please put them into the chat and we'll try to get to as many questions as we can today uh we also have our digital librarian who will be putting information into the chat during the session that you can click on and save um a lot of really great information gets put into the chat so keep an eye on that as well and without further ado i'm going to turn it over to um nestor sosa who can introduce himself and go ahead and proceed with this presentation yes thank you carla and joanna i'm nestor sosa i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm uh hospital uh let me share my screen i'm gonna go over my my update today and hello everyone see if i can put this in the big screen there you go display setting all right i'm ready now so okay so first of all i'm gonna actually there were more interesting news than articles over this weekend so many things were communicated in the late press so i just want to go over some of those things in case you you didn't hear some of these news and most are related to vaccine and vaccine success first of all there was an announcement that now the pfizer vaccine one of the mrna vaccine do not need the -70-80 for storage so the at least the european amazing agency approve the the request from pfizer to to use -25 which is sort of a pharmacy standard pharmacy refrigerator and blood bank refrigerator also so so that's that makes it a little bit easier to store and and distribute these uh vaccines uh there were other news on pfizer and i want to go over them um i have obviously no no conflict of interest but there were a couple of really dramatic um developments first of all good news for the kids 12 to 15 years old pfizer announced the preliminary results we have to wait for the publication but the phase three that included over uh 2200 uh 12 to 15 year old and the vaccine showed an effect efficacy for symptomatic disease of a hundred percent so there were 18 cases in the placebo group zero cases and the vaccine groups so very highly efficacious and in fact they mentioned also in in in passing in this in this news um outlet that the the antibodies produced by the kids were even higher than the 16 to 25 year olds so so they do have the amount of robust uh antibody uh response to the mrna vast into this specific mrna vaccine so good news and and they they already started enrolling they enrolled the first uh patient in the six month to eleven years so though those trials are already ongoing and they have enrolled the first few kids in that trial so good news f for for that part of the trial and that group which is needed for the hurt immunity the other part is that they they actually commented on the on the duration of the antibody respawn and duration of protection for this same uh pfizer vaccine and they actually mentioned that an in analysis six months after uh vaccination the the efficacy against symptomatic disease remains over 90 91.3 they found 850 cases in the placebo group versus 777 so almost 10 times more cases in the placebo than in the vaccine group i'm sorry and when they look at severe disease there was a hundred percent efficacy no severe disease in those vaccinated although there were some cases of mild disease there were zero uh in the vaccine group which is really encouraging and for me the most encouraging of all news is that they uh they mentioned that in in this follow-up of the large trial they have 800 subjects enrolled in south africa which is as you know the area where the 351 um variant of concern is circulating and this is the most troublesome we have look at some laboratory data with this strain the 351 the b11351 strain and they found much to my surprise and the surprise of many 100 vaccine efficacy although we have been showing data that the neutralizing antibody is it's lower it's lower uh but they they were they had zero cases in the vaccine group in this group in these patients in south africa versus nine in the placebo for for obviously we need to wait for the full publication of these sort of extension of the of the large 46 000 subjects but it's it's definitely encouraging remember that other vaccines have not fared that well against the variant and in fact over the last few days they published the data on the this is the shadows one which is the astra seneca oxford vaccine and was essentially useless against the south african strain if you remember this is the graph that usually separates the vaccine from placebo the famous crab that i have shown for modernity and pfizer where here it doesn't separate so the cases in both group vaccine and placebo are essentially the same in fact the the efficacy was around 10 only for the for the oxford vaccine against the b1351 variant so so just to to compare 100 versus in this case 10 of efficacy so obviously um no no efficacy there for the for the astra seneca against this new new barrier as opposed to the preliminary uh news report uh i want to emphasize that news report of of 100 efficacy against the south african with the mrna vaccine and i haven't really mentioned much about the sputnik which is another vaccine that is being used and actually it's been used a lot in latin america several countries have already uh negotiated with the with the russian government the implementation of these and and these authors which are independent of the of the company of the gamalia uh institute actually did uh what we have been presenting here they took uh serum from patients who have been immunized fully immunized with the sputnik and they um compare the neutralizing activity of their serum against the different variant this is the uk or b117 wild type which is basically the original wuham virus and the african and and this one is just a mu with one mutation the the 484k which is the escape variant that they have identified and again um there's a significant impact in the neutralizing activity uh against um the the uh south african variant as opposed to the other and you may ask why why the difference well the only difference that i could really find why the astra seneca and this one well besides the fact that they are both um they're both adenovirus vaccine as opposed to naked mrna vaccines the other thing is that they use the the mrna vaccines when they they synthetize the spike protein the spy protein is in the prefusion it's like locked in the prefusion um conformation because they added two prolines amino acid uh in this and that and that's a proprietary um you know thing so so both um moderna and pfizer and and even johnson and johnson bought this this uh modified spike protein to keep it in the in the prefusion and presumably in that prefusion generates more antibodies more robust than just a naturally occurring uh spike protein which folds itself and goes into the tertiary uh structure which seems to induce less of a powerful response so that that's what the scientists are speculating that maybe although all of these vaccines generate the synthesis of spike protein there's there's some ultra structural differences especially in the in the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein that may be giving us a difference again these variants well stay tuned we'll we'll see that uh but this again this is spoken but in the lab not spoken clinically we haven't seen any data of the spokenig in south africa this is just using uh virus in the laboratory or pseudo-virus in the laboratory okay there were a couple of publications so much for the for the news and comparison with other some publications on real life effectiveness of the mrna vaccine i think two or three papers that basically show the the the real life activity and one i think was mentioned by dr sivers last week this is the mnwr publication that she mentioned and and it shows uh essentially a 90 um effectiveness because this is this is real life so we use the word effectiveness as opposed to efficacy or efficacy um for the fully immunized 14 days after the second dose they saw a 90 uh decrease in the in the in the in the cases of of of kobe 19 among those vaccinated in eight locations within the united states from basically the start of vaccination middle of december to the middle of march um so so good news this is uh a pretty large study showing real life benefit of the vaccine another really impressive and this is visually impressive this is just um from one medical center here in the us and and actually you can see the dots here are the cases in healthcare worker how they were increasing uh throughout november and december there was a the the famous second peak in in this center and it could have been i mean should should have gone continually up and up the number of cases but then they started vaccination here in the middle of december and you can see how the dots go down significant to the point that in mid-february there were barely a few cases of covet among the healthcare worker and you can see here numerically 2.2 of the healthcare worker testing positive then 1.82 shortly after they started vaccination when they were partially vaccinated and and 0.05 percent when they um they were fully vaccinated so really a dramatic collapse in the number of cases showing obviously or we have already seen in other in other settings the the degree of protection from disease that these vaccines usually confer and finally another similar study in this case from healthcare workers in california another store this was published in the new england journal and you can see as the as the day after vaccination with the first dose and second those go by you can see the numbers how they're basically you know uh being smaller and smaller to the point that 15 days after vaccination there were only seven cases out of four thousand that were tested in these in this uh in this setting um if you want to be a pessimist or or sort of careful person you have to say well there's still vaccinated people who get the the disease and it's true seven out of four thousand uh tested positive despite being fully vaccinated so that's that's the importance of not dropping your guard uh before knowing that you can still have infection although presumably most of the data shows less severe disease uh even lower viral loads in some of the studies but you still can see some so you shouldn't be surprised if you hear or read about a person who was fully vaccinated but develop kobe because it's not a hundred percent as we know really well but definitely an impressive also decrease in the new infections in this cohort of healthcare workers and this paper actually leslie hayes suggested that i presented this paper and it was really interesting and the question of this paper is um is vaccine immunity superior to natural infection and we we have been sort of hinting that that's probably true but this this paper really show show it graphically very nicely so this is a research letter published in yama uh just a few days ago neutralizing antibodies against our scoby two variants after infection and vaccination so what they did they took serum from infected patients acutely infected patients convalescent patients all in the u.s and vaccinated individuals with mrna vaccines and then they they measured the neutralization capacity against the different variants and you you're probably very familiar because we have presented this a1 and b1 are sort of the wild type a and b clades this is the uk variant which is very prevalent now in the united states and this is a laboratory produced variant with just one mutation the 5 0 1 which is the mutation that is seen in several of the of the variants of concern and you can see that infected patient convalescence individuals have you know a pretty decent 10 to the two neutralization levels but the vaccinated it's 10 to the 3 so so basically 10 times higher against all of the variants that were studied in this trial so definitely this this study shows that the immunity against all the neutralization antibodies are are it's higher or the neutralization activity is higher when you receive the vaccine as opposed to an acute infected patient or a convalescent individual so and that's one of the reasons why people with college should be uh vaccinated because they they're going to get a sort of a booster a better um immune response than they if they just had the natural infection so that that's i think striking but it definitely proves that at least the quantitative difference in the antibody production between one group and the other uh which is which is i think it's it's important uh to demonstrate and finally this is basically i think in one of the previous office hours we we asked about the risk of uh severe coping in asthmatics and and we we mentioned that that what we have seen is that it doesn't raise the risk that much um so the the the uk and these authors from the uk actually did a very nice population-based study in which they took uh from several primary care clinics they took the diagnosis of the patient with respiratory disease so they had a whole group of patients with different diseases and then they compared the or they look into the the national database of copy cases and they cross these two databases from primary care and from covet hospitalizations and that and the interesting finding was despite you know what when common sense may indicate respiratory disease especially asthma uh either asthma in general active asthma or severe asthma was not a significant risk factor for death uh due to kobe then this is what we mentioned before but it was sort of confirmed by these by this story only you know five percent increased risk thirteen percent increase risk of death um if you compare with all age or diabetes uh are much more uh high associated with a higher hazard ratio of death and icu than and even some of these other diseases like copd 1.55 the only one i think it was undefined interstitial lung disease and lung cancer were twice um a slightly of dyeing of cobalt if they if they got copied and had that underlying condition than many of the other respiratory diseases that are listed here so that was sort of interesting um i mean it probably doesn't change practice but at least we can we can reassure the patients with copd and asthma that they are not at a dramatically increased risk of of suffering severe cavity if they if they get caught um so that was i think it was an interesting finding and finally this is my last paper it's kind of a nice color paper uh it was a also a research letter um published i think in jama in which they they analyze analyze the excess death from kobe 19 and other causes in the u.s and i think leslie is going to talk about causes of death during the the kobe epidemic but they found a 22 almost 23 percent excess debt so there were 30 uh i mean sorry 33 more people dying than than expected in the year of the of the pandemic from march to january march 2020 to january 2021 obviously uh non-hispanic blacks were disproportionately affected uh sixty percent of those success death uh uh were among among um non-hispanic blacks and this is more than what they are in the general population um um 72 percent of these deaths were due to covet obviously the majority of them but not of them there was also increases in death in alzheimer's heart disease and diabetes um independent obviously of the covet but but due to probably lack of access or or or some difficulties obtaining care for these diseases and interestingly enough unfortunately we are in the top the the paper side the 10 highest states with per capita excess debt and mississippi new years in new york arizona alabama luciana south dakota and new mexico north dakota and ohio are there in the top 10 of of excess death as a state in the in in here in the united states and it was also interesting to see graphically the shape of the of the pandemic in the different regions like in the new england and northeast was clearly a huge peak when new york was affected and the northeast at the beginning of the year and another smaller peak in december as opposed to south uh east and southwest the more warmer areas there was a huge peak in the summer that we remember and then the large also uh spike in the in the at the end of the year so completely different uh epidemic from from the northeast here in the south southwest and southeast and you can see this great lakes here and rocky mountains and others here so very interesting population also based epidemiological paper recommended reading uh there is a there's an article about how copy it affects the brain it's really short it's almost one page but it has this complicated but nice um illustration of the different hypothesis how covet actually affects the brain um and obviously enters the the endothelial cells produces the you know production of cytokines and the pro and these cytokines tend to activate the micro glia and then there's changes in the neurotransmitter and they go on to explain the changes in this neurotransmitter and how they uh they produce toxicity in the brain excito toxicity and hypoxic injury there's also the the traumas phenomenon or the the strokes that occur so very nice article just to to take a good idea how acutely and also chronically we see this patient with brain fog and lack of concentration and other cns events explained in this yama psychiatry article and finally this is this is a very practical there was a perspective article on how to address um vaccine hesitancy in in black indigenous population and people of color um and and you know what i like about this these uh perspective was that they they presented a table and it's larger than this this is just a piece of the table um with all the questions or other relevant questions that people may ask you about the vaccine and how you know the the explanation for those questions in a in an easy to understand uh transparent and and uh and and good way to explain it so i found very useful i think you know anybody who takes care of of a patient that may be hesitant to receive the vaccine should go through this questionnaire and actually uh try to explain to the patients why vaccines are safe why it has been stolen etc so it's very interesting it was published in the new england journal on march 31st that's it thank you thank you very much jester for that awesome presentation um leslie can you go ahead and introduce yourself hi leslie hayes family medicine and addiction medicine in espanola and i'm just going to be doing a quick primary care update today i was very sad when i found that article that people who had had copa did not have better immunity than people who were vaccinated i thought i should at least get some some benefit out of it but i guess not so although it is a superpower when it comes to talking people into getting the vaccine because i just smile very sweetly and say you know i've had covet and i would really recommend against getting it and people listen to that um so um i also i'm talking about an article about leading causes of death and for um all of 2020 coveted actually the number three cause of death there were 345 000 deaths in 2020 it was behind heart disease and cancer and it was largely responsible for the substantial increase in death heart disease deaths increased by 4.8 percent which was the highest increase since 2012 also occurred for unintentional injury 11 alzheimer's and diabetes the increase was likely due to less preventative care um some of them we wonder what the heart disease and diabetes make more people develop those whether or not cobit actually could have had an effect directly there as well and the number of deaths occurring in the us among us residents was 3.3 million which was an increase of almost 18 from 2.8 million in 2019 so a really substantial increase and this is just shows the us and you can see there's the initial peak here in march and then in july then again um at the end of the year and i thought this was interesting if you look at the causes of death and um as we mentioned heart disease did go up cancer did not unintentional injuries went up and unfortunately they didn't separate out as to whether it was car accidents or overdose i know i've heard overdose death rates definitely went up and i had heard for a while that accidental um deaths have gone down and i would like to know what the final numbers for the year were but that wasn't in there one thing that though um i think we should point out is that suicide deaths actually went down and i heard over and over and i don't know about the rest of you that um lockdowns were causing an increase in suicide and fortunately that did not turn out to be true suicide deaths were actually down for 2020. and next i this one i'm presenting just because of a patient i had two weeks ago i had a man in his 70s come in to the clinic to get copic vaccine he had a history of well-controlled hypertension and right after he got the vaccine he told the medical assistant that he felt floaty she um checked his blood pressure which had been well controlled we didn't check it before he got the vaccine but at that time he had a pulse of 45 and a blood pressure of 196 over 110 um this was about 10 minutes after the vaccine we repeated it about 10 minutes later it was 200 over 120 with a pulse of 42. um ekg was started some stt wave changes he was sent to the er he had a negative cardiac workup that improved um but not normalizing of his blood pressure and i don't know whatever ended up happening but then this article popped up in my feed and it was a case series in hypertension which is a publication american heart association and they had nine patients who had stage three hypertension documented within minutes of vaccination eight of them were symptomatic i have no idea why they checked the ninth they didn't say median h was 73 um seven females two males um eight of the nine patients had a prior history of hypertension most were on high blood pressure medications most were observed for several hours in the emergency room there were not any sequelae for any of them um mechanism was unclear they did feel unlikely stressed all of them had a normal heart rate as i mentioned my gentleman actually had a low heart rate and they did recommend consider checking blood pressure or monitor for symptoms um in elderly patients with hypertension we have not changed anything we've done in my clinic yet and i haven't seen any official recommendations on what to do nor do i know if this is going to be just a few weird cases or if it's actually a true side effect from the vaccine certainly since it's not an anaphylactic reaction there's no recommendation not to repeat the vaccine for the second dose and then burnout and sleep deprivation are not good for you they did an article on covet 19 i'm looking at healthcare workers and whether or not we were getting enough sleep and whether or not we were burned out and from july 17 to the 25th um of september in 2020 they did a web-based survey to 2884 healthcare workers in six different countries who had a high frequency of workplace exposure they provided information on their demographics their sleep number of hours that they slept at night whether or not they were napping in the daytime and if they had any sleep problems if they were burned out from work and what their covered 19 exposures were there were 568 cobia 19 cases um 2300 controls and one hour longer sleep duration at night was associated with twelve percent lower autocova 19 probability was good having no sleep problems having all three sleep problems was associated with an 88 percent greater chance of getting covered um reporting burnout date every day was associated with greater odds of covet 19 2.6 times as likely longer duration 2.98 times as likely and severity 3.26 compared with reporting no burnout i will point out that this likelihood is um higher than dr sosa just pointed out for lung disease so i'm going to say everybody on here after we're done you can take the afternoon off please go take a nap and do something that you find really fun doctor's orders and then just interesting things um one in five cobot affected healthcare workers ways quitting in a study which i just found very bothersome i know we have had a lot more turnover at my clinic since uh cobit started and it just seems like many many people are just ready to toss it in after this and then this article actually make me more concerned than any of the um official medical stuff i've read which is i have heard that they were having an outbreak in british columbia rated i can't remember which of the variants it's related to but half of the vancouver canucks um players have tested positive for cobit 19 and apparently some of them are quite sick none of them are hospitalized yet that we know of um but they've required iv fluids and other treatments so and then this was just a useful summary if anybody um wants to give it to friends who are still not completely sure but how does covet 19 spread the top five things everyone should know and then the last one is vaccine cheat days are adding up and this just basically talks about we can kind of see the end in sight and people are like almost there so it's like you know i've only had one vaccine and um but i'm getting the next one next week so i think i can go ahead and socialize it just it was really a good reminder that we need to keep doing what we're doing until things have really gotten better so and that was all i had thank you so much leslie i wanted just to ask um i don't believe that carissa is on but cecilia thompson is on from tricor infectious diseases cecilia if you had any updates from tricor or from laboratory updates i don't have any updates but i'm happy to take any questions great thank you very much and our um marla sivers is not on yet but she says that she's gonna try to get on later so if you have any public health questions just hold them till the end and i'm gonna turn it over to joanna to go ahead and proceed with the questions thanks carla thanks nestor thanks leslie um okay um lots of great questions and thanks for the amazing presentations nestor and leslie um harry seibold um says uh is wonder wondering to know uh nestor do you think uh um emergency use authorization uh to the fda is forthcoming regarding 12 to 15 year olds um due to the pfizer study showing amazing efficacy or effectiveness and that's another of dr seibel's question by the way too is kind of what is the difference between efficacy and effectiveness yeah i i don't know i mean how soon it's going to be i know they are working on that but i think and they had the data ready when they did the first eua but the discussion they actually took out the 12 to 15 year old because they had that data ready to present way back in december so my my feeling is that yes it's going to be uh a proof but but really i i i don't know how soon it's going to be but i know the pfizer is pushing for that and they're actually enrolling in the younger group this group is already finished and follow so so they're probably gonna go ahead and push especially with these outstanding results no i forgot to mention but there was no safety issues they didn't see anything anything uh you know dramatic with regarding safety in that group and and then the high efficacy and high antibody levels so i don't see a reason why not to be honest and then the difference between efficacy and effectiveness efficacy is usually used when when you do a trial it's in a controlled environment with you know placebo against placebo in a research setting and effectiveness is in vaccination or vaccinology is used when you measure the the the activity of the vaccine in the real life in the community in your hospital but not within a strict control randomized trial would actually be seen in in real people with you know all sorts of underlying diseases underlying risk factors um an actual implementation of the of the vaccine in the in the routine so that when you get the results of that you you talk about effectiveness when it's in coming from a trial you you talk about efficacy it's confusing but that's that's sort of the international uh standard for for terminology with vaccine efficacy and effectiveness thank you nestor i think all of a sudden on the echo should try to leverage to get you on that on the fda vaccine committee i think you're i think you're the country's expert right now i think we need to get you so you can approve i'm super i'm too pro vaccine i would approve everything that they put in front of me i just want to get this epidemic finished okay um dan um dan saltman do you want to unmute and ask your question about the case fatality uh rates sure thanks joanna uh i yeah so the case fatality rate is a number that i think was hard to come by early on because people just didn't know and then when it's when people are vaccinated or the vaccines start rolling out it it affects that case fatality rate but do we have a sense of what the sars cov2 virus case fatality rate is a kind of estimate of it now that it's been a while that it's been out in the in the world and and uh you know and how does that compare with with influenza that was kind of the original one of the original discussions and i was wondering now there's been enough time that's passed maybe we got a sense about what the what the real case fatality rate is right yeah that's a great question and it's a moving target and and i i tried to explain why uh first of all because k authority rate uh it's just the people who are diagnosed and and die uh that's that's the case fatality rate um and diagnosed with a clinical disease so so and that definition has changed because when you start doing like at the beginning there were few testing so we were only seeing those hospitalized with severe disease so the case fatality rate was high because you the the denominator were people who were in the hospital with severe disease so the case fatality rate was higher when you start to include in the case fatality rate mild cases people who are not hospitalized and if you include asymptomatic cases the case fatality rate basically drops um so i've seen ranges from like 0.8 0.7 to 2.6 which was the highest number that i saw during the the the epidemic so it's i would say it's slightly below one percent the case fatality rate but it depends on many factors you know what you're putting in the denominator what your population is if you have all elderly people it's going to be higher if you include only young people it's going to be lower uh so it depends on in the area uh where you're doing the the the studies like and it's completely different in every age group and you know in younger groups it's much lower than older groups um over over 80 it's if the case fatality rate goes to 20 25 i seen if you're over 80 and get copied as opposed to if you're 19 years old it's probably less than 1.13 so it's it's a huge gap between the the different ages and risk factors thank you for the question dr saltman thanks nestor um uh carol miller asked a really good question in that how is the large decrease in in testing i think in certain states uh definitely affecting the outcomes um or the effectiveness of the data that we're seeing um uh with the you know reduction of the testing and i don't necessarily if you want to weigh in as well as nestor um so i'll let nestor weigh in but i think if marlo are here she might be a good one to answer this because the decrease in testing means that we are doing less surveillance less contact tracing and it's really important from that public health point of view yeah i totally agree i mean the definitely if if you decrease testing um you know you're not going to have a like a realistic measure of the pandemic and there are several factors i mean with the vaccinated population increasing those cases are going to be asymptomatic or possibly fortunately enough but then we're not going to detect them because even in adults it could be a mild disease and they may not get tested so that it's really complicating the the testing issue uh on the good news side is that the fda uh recently gave authorization to a couple of home-based testing so they're even pcr testing so there are a couple of of new uh easier to get testings in hopefully in the future so people will be able to to buy it and do and then confirm it if it's positive so that's that's sort of a move in the right direction and there have been a couple of um very vocal epidemiologists michael mina from harvard who has been advocating for like aggressive testing you know like almost every other day testing for for people who are in congregate settings or going to places or going to concerts etc to try to test as much as you can as frequent as you can to detect those asymptomatic or or pre-symptomatic cases and i think that's you know at some point if we have inexpensive rapid home tests maybe more feasible than than before that you have to go to one of the places where they test and you have to get in your car and do the you know the usual uh to be tested so um it's it's a reality but there's a concern that because of the feeling that the pandemic is going away there's a decreased intestine in some areas so hopefully that will will not have an effect on the on the overall you know course of the pandemic i will see great um there's a couple questions from carla and leslie on the juggle on work the lumping of the under accidental deaths and drug overdoses and and leslie do you want to maybe clarify that regarding your um excess death study sure so they lumped the um intention unintentional injuries together which was the vast majority of that is overdoses in car accidents um and we know that stayed about steady my guess is that accidents went down and drug overdoses went up and laura tomati just pushed or put something in the chat saying um essentially that but i haven't had a chance to actually read it i was just about to look at it when you asked so um but um i have generally heard that overdose death rates were up for 2020 and car accidents down thank you leslie um there's a there's several vaccine questions and i think we might wait to see if marla comes on the line um uh follow me family asks a question i might just read it if a patient develops a significant reaction like fever aches headaches etc but not anaphylaxis four hours after the covert vaccine should they get the second one wanted to ask you nestor or leslie your thoughts on that yes yes what the cdc says it's just allergic reaction so it's just if it's sort of sort of a reactogenic event with fever malaise um definitely should get the second dose that would suggest to me if it's with the first dose that they had copied before because people would call it tend to have a more severe first dose reaction than those who are naive to the virus or to the spy protein but but yeah i think it's not a contraindication if it's just fever malaise fatigue pain in the area of injection as opposed to like you know anaphylactic reaction or laryngeal edema urticaria hypotension which are indications of a more you know histamine or some type of allergic media type one allergic reaction in which the second dose is contraindicated uh can people go with a different type of vaccine can they go with jnj or could they go with the other mrna vaccine or is it just recommended not to give another vaccine right i haven't seen that answer specifically it makes sense uh if it's not the same platform and not the same ingredients in the vaccine but i i i've seen that they should not receive the second dose that's what i have read but i haven't seen the recommendation or jump into another another platform as of yet i don't know if anybody else have seen it but i haven't uh thank thank you nestor and leslie um i just have one more question i'm going to turn it over to carl after that um i i've heard i heard on the news yesterday a couple of times about the you know these outbreaks not in new mexico but in michigan in philadelphia and other parts of the country where they're actually increasing uh the transmission you know at greater rates and they're much more increased about a fourth uh fourth wave um than we are in new mexico even and the idea about ring vaccination meaning getting people around this kind of really tackling the the surge in those areas more quickly and just wanted to get your thoughts on that yeah i mean that makes sense i mean we have done it for like yellow fever outbreaks uh in africa and brazil that if you have an area with cases you'd go and do like an intensive vaccination regardless of age exposures risk factors so at least it make we have precedent or it makes sense from a public health but it also depends on how how much how many doses of vaccines you have what's your you know logistic uh availability of nurses or vaccinators etc so but yeah it's been done with epidemics before in which you create like a circle of vaccination around a community or an area that is heavily affected you neglect the areas where there's no circulation and just concentrate all your resources there and there are many things that we are not doing and i was reading a piece in the new york times um you know like there are things like delay in the second dose the uk is doing that we're not um even using a smaller dose there's phase two study with smaller doses of moderna and pfizer that are effective so we you know it's just that we don't um we're using the regular dose because that's what the fda says but in cases of emergency you can you can use half of the dose you can space the second dose and vaccinate more people more rapidly so but i think because we are so you know following the rules which is good um and it um there's no flexibility in in our in our you know actions but but it's it's interesting that other countries or other healthcare system are using these strategies to really maximize the number of people we know that with one dose of the mrnas you get eighty percent protection so uh which is even higher than than some of the two doses uh than virus vaccine so um you know in in if i were the epidemiologist in a case like that i would probably try to open the discussion of my my advisors on that if those strategies are valid thank you nestor so much back to you carla thank you i'm just on that subject mr the there's a question from andrew ondo is there any discussion about giving postcode patients only one vaccine injection versus two as the immune response is dramatic dramatically higher than with just one yeah i i haven't seen here in the us except for like the twitter feeds there are some experts who are actually advocating for that but i can tell you uh because i know there are a couple of countries already that have officially approved just one those for postcode vaccination to try to use the second dose or the other dose for for our patients who have not had infections so but i guess yeah the discussion is probably taking place but i i i have not been invited to those discussions but i can tell you that like in my country in panama there's only we're recommending only one of those based on the on the data that we have seen and i think there are one or two countries in the in the european union which are also advocating for single dose after covet and it makes sense at least from the neutralizing antibody levels are higher than a person who gets two doses so if you have copied one dose that combination is produces higher um geometric minimum neutralization than two doses of copied in a naive patient so you know probably there's a question about durability but at least for the short run you can delay that second dose and use it for another person for another uh you know a naive person that has not developed coffee and that may may have a high risk of getting sick from it so for me it makes sense but i haven't really seen any official work from cdc or fda or or any any of the official bodies here in the in the us okay great thank you and before we leave vaccine there's just so many vaccine questions but um maria garcia lanosa asked about is there any information on the sputnik vaccine and the p1 strain from brazil have you heard anything about that nester no i have not i have not uh no i just the paper that i presented which basically shows some decrease in the level but i haven't seen any any any uh on that just the comment is that that you know if what i have seen and read about the the different spy protein which i mentioned during the presentation is that the spike protein that is produced um with the astrosenica and with the with the spookney vaccine is slightly different to the mrna to this to the spy protein that is produced with it with the mrna with the johnson and johnson vaccine because it has doesn't have those two proteins that make it stable uh and and in the prefusion conformation so i don't know if that's going to be the the difference at the end explaining the difference in immuno immunogenicity and and protection but it's it's an interesting you know structure uh efficacy correlation that i that i thought it was interesting great thank you and fred fox has a really great question about the efficacy studies for vaccines fred do you want to unmute yourself and ask your question if not i can ask ask it yeah in many of the studies whether they're looking at efficacy or efficient uh effectiveness it's only reporting neutralizing antibodies yet um in an individual's response it really depended not just on this but on non-neutralizing antibodies and their opsonification signaling on the cell mediated response and all the cd4 and cd8 and also the innate immune response so are these other immune responses actually being measured especially when looking at the vaccines because their profound effectiveness would imply that either these other systems are being activated or somehow the interaction between them is being maximized yeah excellent question i mean in in this uh like rapid publication that we have shared about um impact of variance on the on the vaccination i haven't seen any data uh from the t cell response or other parts of the immune system they they have really concentrated neutralizing antibodies um and and not in the other aspect which are which which should or may play a role in the immune response so i they did they did show t-cell responses in the original phase two and phase three trials so if you go back and you look at the phase two trials they they they have the neutralizing but they also showed how uh t1 respond t1h response was was induced by this vaccine because we wanted to for for it to be t1 as opposed to t2 uh th1 as opposed to th2 because of the previous uh bad experiences with with vaccines that induce tt th2 which is associated with like worsening disease or or enhancement of the disease with vaccination but i haven't seen the correlation or the activity of the variants with t-cells i haven't read that much interesting there's a paper that i'm probably going to review next week they did an experiment with macaques with uh with monkeys basically and they they depleted them of t-cells and they compare uh they're neutralizing antibodies and they found interestingly enough to surprise of all of the commentators of that paper that t-cell was not important for neutralizing antibodies so so you know the question is are we overstating the importance of t cells it's i mean it's just one paper it's in monkeys not in humans um but it's interesting and i'll discuss that finding it's completely surprising finding the the the t cell apparently are not as important as we thought because these monkeys have no t cells no cd4 no cda and they were able to mount a pretty decent response with the vaccination uh so that's that was sort of you know really surprising i think the authors thought that it was going to be the other way around that the monkeys were not going to be able to be immunized because they have no t cells and and and it didn't it didn't work that way it was the other way around it was a pretty decent response without t cells so we'll see it's in it it's an interesting a good question but thank you um leslie when you and the excess stuff paper that you looked at was cancer death not increased in terms of excess death in that in that literature it was not which is interesting because we all thought it might be because of the delay in screening but i'm wondering if it's something where it's going to hit in a year or two we're going to be seeing a lot of advanced cancers because that's going to take i think a little bit more time to show up than say heart disease which will show up more rapidly yeah great thank you and um could you comment um dan saltman wanted to just someone to comment about the role of obesity and the more severe infection either one of you or both of you i mean it's definitely quite elevated for um people who are overweight especially once you get over a bmi i think of 35 it goes up fairly dramatically nestor do you have another comment any comment yeah i i maybe a century ago i read a paper on obesity and coping and and it basically mentioned that because of the amount of fat cells in the body there's more inflammatory mediators so supposedly fat tissue it's a important producers of of inflammatory cytokines etc so the the and this is the same pathophysiology of some of the some of the diseases that are associated with obesity so they thought that that cytokine storm is it's uh it's more more uh dramatic and people who are overweight or or obese um there's also some mechanical issues when when you're hypoxemic if you already have like a decreases quotient of the diaphragm etc also that you know sort of simpler mechanical explanation for the issues with obesity but i think we don't we don't know the whole the whole story but that those were like the the points that the paper made about how how to explain obesity with with um with that and obviously there's also the the relationship with diabetes and insulin resistance and other metabolic consequences of obesity that may or may not be associated with a more severe copy but i thought it was it was interesting um you know at least the the theoretical explanations of why an obese person will have a more severe uh viral infection which which is sort of unique in that sense thank you um jeff miller has a couple of questions just about reinfection um is what is the latest information on how protective a previous history of copenhagen illnesses from getting sick with it a second time that's the first part of the question i've seen eighty percent effective so nestor anything yeah can can you repeat the question again i was looking for the librarian put the article that i found he put it right away now how how protect is there any what's the latest information on how protective a previous history of copa 19 is from getting sick a second yeah well leslie said it's around 80 percent it has been looking the healthcare workers in the siren study and a couple of other large studies with healthcare workers which are you know easy to study because they are like close to the researchers and they have found that yeah if you have copied you at least have 80 percent protection and they they're now talking about six to eight months is the the length of study that they have been able to to validate or the length of protection so far and it's probably longer than that but but at least six to eight months uh 80 percent okay great and then um the the second part of the question is if um what is the impact on getting seriously ill a second time do people get this are they more likely to get more seriously ill the second time or less likely i i mean i've seen case reports of more severe disease especially at the beginning of the pandemic when i was counting their infection publications there were some reinfections that were more severe they were older milder um but i i don't know what like the latest uh assessment of that now that we have much more data on that i can tell you that that for instance what's happening in brazil with this later searching cases is that at least these second cases with the p1 variant seems to be with higher mortality case fatality rate doubles or triples if you compare with the first wave and some of those cases are are second infections uh because are people who were infected in the first so i think it depends on on factors like like your age how far away was your first infection i mean if it was march or april and now you're getting another one a year later it may not be a big difference in severity so so i think there are several factors and also that if you're infected with a more pathogenic uh variant like b117 or p1 uh you're probably going to have a more severe disease than the first time around so but that's a good question i don't really know like a single answer for that thank you thank you nestor i just wanted to let everybody know that the um cme link went into the chat about 12 44. if you want to see me for this please fill that out and we would love to hear your feedback and i'm going to turn it over to joanna for the remainder of the questions thanks carla um uh laura tomati do you want to unmute and ask your question about um school-age kids it's a really good one at the very end yeah i think especially with uh i sent my daughter back to school today in person i was just wondering if you guys had any thoughts on you know there's been some kind of more casual reporting about increases in uh covet especially variants like the uk variant and school aged children and then that may be driving some of the spikes they're seeing in michigan for example and just wondering if you had what you found on that and you know if there's anything sort of us in new mexico should prepare for yeah i summarize what i have seen and heard some of these are just coming from from some experts in podcasts that i follow they have anecdotically reported an increase in the severity of the mis of the multi-inflammatory syndrome and and in children but i haven't really seen any any publication to that regard um we know from data from the uk that there was a increase in the percentage of children affected with the uk variant so so because that one is the one becoming more prevalent in the us i wouldn't be surprised if if we see more cases in younger population the same phenomenon has been observed in brazil there's an increase in the number of cases among young younger patients and even more severe disease i think i mentioned last week a paper in which they saw in the group 20 to 29 at triple of the case fatality rate uh and the rest of the group was the double case double the case fatality rate so there's definitely um you know more death and more hospitalizations and severe disease in younger age group although it's it's still a small percentage we're talking from you know point zero six to point thirteen that's double uh the case for that is this is still less than one percent fatality rate but it's a doubling of the fatality rate but i have seen and heard this um sort of shifting of the disease to our younger population i think we need to be on the look for that um you know in our data and there's also an effect on vaccination we have vaccinated a sizeable percentage of our you know over 75 over 60 so probably just by uh the natural effect of the protection of the vaccine most of the cases are going to now be seen in the you know less than 60 less than 50 years of age which are lagging behind vaccination in some states thank you laura for the great question thank you nestor um dr anjali from unm um says she's heard that new mexico will be a sight for the the younger kids trials and just we don't have marla on but want to know if anyone if you've heard about that nestor or leslie or anybody else and does anyone know how to sign up for those if that's the case um maybe we can ask marla next week if she's heard i i don't know really i haven't heard here okay great no no problem um uh and then uh dr colemeyer i think from uh state of washington says it's any update on nestor on the presentation you gave last week about the um adt the androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor blockers um any update on that that you've kind of read in the literature no nothing so far we're waiting for the publication of the what we saw in the european news outlet about the 92 percent recovery rate et cetera um and i i really want to to be cautious because we have i remember the excitement with the kochi scene and and you know and the hydroxychloroquine so i think we need to be a little bit now we're mature we've been through a year of of uh hopeful news and that they do not really uh so we'll have to wait and see what the publication where the limitations of the vapors are but just to recap they they mentioned this was a double-blind placebo control story with prosalutamide which is a androgen receptor inhibitor that is presumably used for from metastatic prostate cancer and they found a very dramatic uh percentage of recovery very short recovery decreased mortalities all of the endpoints were very favorable uh to the prosolutomate compared with the placebo almost too good to be true i mean it was like if i remember like three percent mortality versus 47 percent in the placebo group so it was like a 92 reduction in mortality uh but we have to see we have to see wait and see um the actual paper uh to make sure that there was not like a bias or some other treatment together with that maybe they gave him dexamethasone or some other treatment on one of the arms and that produce some type of bias in the story so we have to be careful but yeah we're waiting for the for that proxolutamide and also the flu box i mean the other the ocd medication that it has it was like miraculously miraculous results in the source trial we need to wait for the large trial to to see the results there was a study in chest infections a couple weeks ago on progesterone in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone and the treatment of men hospitalized with moderate to severe cobit and they actually had 42 patients randomized and definitely not as good as the drug that nestor was saying which i'm not going to be able to pronounce but patients treated with progesterone required three fewer days of supplemental oxygen were hospitalized for two and a half fewer days so interesting really interesting uh maybe it has something to do with the male predominance too um well we have a minute left um john foster lets us know and thank you for that john that um there is a moderna youth trial six months and up going on in phoenix arizona um and kent knows where they are digital librarians said unm researchers to join national trial of moderna vaccine and children so okay thank you for that ken very much he sent a link and i just wanted everybody to know that there's a few more echoes going on this week at project echo our first responder resiliency echo has a talk today it's called building resilience and first responders uh it's a two-part series it's uh the speakers are very well known uh the speaker today is brigadier general steve zanakis um and he'll be presenting this week at 2 p.m mountain time as well as next week we have the last of our climate change series on wednesday at 10 p.m with a very well-known uh national climate change communicator ed maybach from george mason uni university we have our mental health and resiliency echo with the ihs on thursday at noon as well and carla i wanted to turn it back to you to see if you have any other questions and yes there is the mental health resilience section is today at 2pm mountain time yeah and um we have critical care but not this week it's the 15th of april so that's the next critical care session 8 o'clock on the 15th thank you for that carla and yeah the the cme went in and we'd love to get your feedback thank you so much and we'll see you next week thank you nestor and leslie thanks everybody,,4/5/2021
44,morning everyone or good afternoon welcome to the coven 19 office hour session for today we're going to go get go ahead and get started with some housekeeping announcements um i'm i'm dr carlo thornton i'm an infectious diseases physician here at unm one of the associate directors of project echo and my co-facilitator is joanna katzman joanna are you there yes i'm here hi go ahead joanna i'll turn it over to you oh no problem okay thank you carla yeah joanna katzman here from project echo great um well welcome everybody um it's uh april 12th and uh we have a great schedule for you today we've got uh great presentations from dr sosa dr hayes and and martha c sievers has a very interesting presentation as well if you have your uh webcam with you today please turn that on it makes it a lot easier for teaching and we can see you and that will be great we also have kent noseworthy on today who's our digital librarian and 45 minutes after the hour you'll be receiving your cme link as well so without further ado i'm going to turn it over to dr sosa he's our chief he's the director of infectious diseases at the university of new mexico school of medicine dr sosa thank you joanna and carla welcome everyone let me share my screen like we do every week i have this update all right let me just advance here okay so the first topic that i want to sort of go over it's the so-called vaccine-inducing immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia which is essentially the name given to the reaction the astra seneca vaccine you probably have heard in the news and i think we we may have commented on these briefly that that um a small minority of patients that received the astra seneca vaccine especially in europe had this rare thrombosis of different veins in this in the central nervous system and splatnic beds and and in fact there were some uh countries that stopped using the the astral seneca vaccine and they have started to analyze so i just want to share a few of the news that the agencies in europe have um voice about this issue and even a publication about it already in the new england journal so so this is the name of the of the phenomenon vit vaccine immune induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia and basically describes what's happening to this patient so one of the one of the news that i want to share first of all is that although this has been really centered around the astra seneca vaccine that as you know it's a it's a use as a chimpanzee coronavirus there was this news in cnbc over the last few days in which the also the the european agency of medicines is also analyzing four cases of blood clots in recipients of johnson and johnson and that's more relevant for us in the us because this is one of the three vaccines that are actually um in use in our countries this is the single shot at the no virus vaccine that it's been given emergency authorization so it's interesting that that this phenomenon that was associated initially with with um with astrosenica vaccine is also being investigated with with uh with uh the johnson and johnson vaccine and they just reported four cases and and i think it's very preliminary but they're they're looking into those cases and we'll follow up on that um obviously much more attention have been given to the astral seneca ultra vaccine and although initially the the the european medicine agency asked for more time to analyze the cases now they seem to to um that the link between these these rare block cloths and and the astra seneca is stronger and they actually um concluded that these unusual block cuts with all playlists should be listed as a side effect of rare but a side effect of the this is a commercial name of the astrosenica vaccine box servia um uh also known as the astrosenica oxford or the shadows one vaccine so that that's important that i think that the uh the european agency has sort of moved the concern from just uh an association to actually uh council link and um i was also waiting for the for the uk uh amazing agency the fda of the uk which is called medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency because they are the country who who produced and generated and created the astrosenica uh and they they were relatively silent as opposed to all the noise and they have vaccinated millions of people in the uk with these vaccines so i was waiting for for something and and they actually published um and the bbc pick up on that a report from the amazing health product um from from the uk that in fact um 79 cases of this rare uh phenomenon have been seen in 20 million vaccinees so it's a you know a pretty rare phenomenon four per million but nevertheless significant with with the risk of one of one death per million of vaccinated um people and and they added in that report that is seen mostly in younger folks less than 60 years as opposed to the the elderly that received initially the vaccine and it's more common in females almost 70 percent of the cases across the board have been reported in female as opposed to male and the interesting thing is what i mentioned thrombosis of the cerebral veins and splatnic veins which are much less common than lower extremity thrombosis we see all the time the the dbt the usual dvt that we see you know people with long uh flights and and um problem states but these are really unusual as the cerebral veins and the splatner veins and in fact the european agency have come up with like an advisory uh like uh symptoms that may be associated with with that basically to educate the public so if if you've been vaccinated with the astra seneca and maybe in the future with the johnson and joseph vaccine you have to be on the look for chinese breath obviously a sign of of a pe chest pain swelling in the leg abdominal pain which would be favored the splenic vein and obviously neurologic symptoms including severe and persistent headache or blurry vision so they are already already and and obviously if you develop thrombocytopenia you may have petechia so tiny bloods blood under the skin uh beyond the side of the injection so so there's already sort of an educational campaign to make people aware this phenomenon occurs approximately uh between two and 14 days after the the vaccine usually with the first dose um so so it's a because most of the patient had not received the second dose one day once they develop this this rare complication but it's seen with the first laws and and usually less than two weeks of of of reception of the of that vaccine the first of the vaccine and in fact there's a hematology expert in europe who's looking into this phenomenon and they have already uh discovered the the the what's the most likely uh mechanism causing this of this thrombocytopenia and thrombosis it's it's similar to to uh to the heparin industrial cytopenia in which there are antibodies against the the pro the platelet factor four which is a protein that is produced by the by the platelets and is usually physiologically used as an i mean has anticoagulation effects but but this patient apparently developed these antibodies that that uh promote platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia so it's it's something similar to what we see with patients who who develop this this rare reaction to heparin obviously this phenomenon is seen in the absence of heparin is sort of associated with the vaccination not with any any uh heparin because most of those 79 cases that i mentioned had not received heparin they just received the the astral seneca vaccine and no heparin so although the mechanism is similar it has nothing to do directly with with uh with heparin um and they also and they come up with that with a case definition for this rare phenomenon in which they they they said typically the patient have you know low platelet clown elevated d-dimer um and they and if you have the the the capacity uh the the you can detect anti-platelet um antibodies against i'm sorry against the platelet factor four in their in their in their serum or their plasma and in fact the new england journal uh published i just saw this article yesterday the thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the astral seneca this is the chadox one um uh vaccination and they actually reported if i remember correctly 12 cases in this study and they uh they did that they showed the laboratory findings so basically confirming what i have mentioned before but interestingly enough they started doing already some um antibody testing and coagulation testing and they found that um in fact in this graph is basically the platelet activation assay um that this patient have a very rapid platelet um aggregation and activation less than than 10 seconds uh when you when you add the ps4 which suggests that there's there is antibodies again this pf4 and then um it produces this uh um aggregation so so they're working on the mechanism it's a bit complicated and this obviously is not my field but um that's what they concluded that that because of this finding and also they found antibodies against the pf4 in disorder using optical density unit against pf4 and pf4 with heparin so there's there's uh definitely circulating presumably auto antibodies against the pf4 and that is what is triggering these um these platelet aggregation and this trauma cytopine and thrombosis what they don't know and and actually the the authors mentioned in this paper is that they don't know what's causing this auto antibody if it's a sort of cross reactivity with something in the vaccine or it's just the inflammatory reaction that the vaccine the adenovirus vaccine produces the the fact that they're seeing the consequences the consequences are the pf4 auto antibodies but they don't know exactly what is triggering the production of those oral antibodies and that's what we're working on uh to to sort of uh get a more deeper explanation why this few you know four four in a million develop these auto antibodies if it's just because of inflammation or there's more specific like molecular mimicry or something between the adenovirus and the and uh and the pf4 so we'll stay tuned and and see what this thing is um i wanted to show you the cdc posted a few weeks ago but it's actually updating the the ver the variance of concern in the u.s and i also um asked dr brett who uh who actually shared with me the some of the some of the stories that the that uh dari ding-wheeler and daryl dunman are doing here in in new mexico so let me just show you a couple of slides so this is in the in the cdc web page and the kobe cdc.gov and these are the different variants um in the united states this is as of uh middle of march and you can see and and i look into this because i saw dr wolenski announcing that officially um b117 the uk variant was the more frequent in the united states now and you can see how it's been growing is the the yellow or light orange so you can see that it's now the most uh frequent of all the variants across the united states and you can see the other the other part and this is one of the these are the california four four two nine and four to seven are the so-called california variants um and then there's a whole bunch of other uh different variants but but i just wanted to to show you and you can find these and we can follow which one are more frequent as you can see um the brazilian p1 and uh and the south african although they have been reported in many states are definitely not the predominant variants in the united states as of yet so that those are good news um and these are the percentages the same you know nice color graph but in percentage so 27.2 percent um is what b117 the uk the so-called uk and then you can see the the rest and you can see p1 here but it's 0.5 the south african 0.5 so they still remain uh infrequent but they have been reported in different states so um just to go and then if you look at new mexico and this is the work of daryl dean will dinwiddie and daryl dunman um here at the university of new mexico uh this is the most recent uh sort of color-coded distribution of variants you can see that we have uh the b the one two is more frequent even more frequent than the one one seven that is more frequent nationwide but you can see that this this blue bar has been growing you can see here and here so it's becoming more frequent evidently and we're also because maybe because we're close to california these are the california variants here are pretty prominent also in in our region so so these are interesting work by by daryl and daryl and and and they're they're doing this periodically so we can follow the evolution in this nice uh color coded uh and i just highlighted the most important variant there are many other uh which are not really variants of concern the normal evolution of the of the virus um and this this is just another publication i have shown several of these publications this is the neutralizing response um we just won those of the physical vaccine um and and here you know we have um a group of of patients who had uh actually six six patients who had infection and they developed antibodies and those antibodies neutralize the original virus um neutralize the v17 variant but it does not neutralize the the 315 and the p1 so so it so basically reaffirming what we know that these variants the the the south african 351 and p1 are less susceptible to neutralization with the natural current infection the good news of this this small paper in the new england journal was that that the at least one dose of the physical vaccine seems to produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies against you know the obviously the original various variant the weak the uk and and against the the south african and p1 so it's interesting but but this is another way to to show um the impact of the variance on the vaccines and and also on immunity from natural infection this was a letter published on april april 7 in new england journal and then because i i mentioned that that i think children are going to get some of the attentions i i decided to to show you two articles on children and they are sort of of really large studies of of scobied in children in the united states and i wanted to share so one was published in jama network the open journal of the jama group and it's called characteristics and disease severity of u.s children and adolescent diagnosed with coping 19. so this is sort of a large cohort study included almost on 869 medical facilities in the u.s they they sort of compile all the information in this database the so-called premier healthcare database and they included subjects less than 18 years diagnosed between march and october so the first couple of waves of the epidemic and they use the diagnosis of of copy 19 in this pediatric population and so this this study is very large 20 714 pediatric er and hospitalization with coffee so it's an analysis of er visits and hospitalization and i'm going to just highlight some of the some of the aspects because this is obviously a very comprehensive article but this this table although it's it's a little bit heavy i'm just going to point out some of the things that that they found first of all they found that kids would severe kobe and i see you in admission uh we're more frequently male which is the same thing that we have seen in adults so so boys are you know more affected with severe disease than girls according to this publication you can see that for the whole pediatric cohort it's almost 50-50 but when you look at the severe disease it's almost 54 versus 46. so definitely boys seems to be more susceptible to being either hospitalized with severe covet or make it into an icu admission and then what we have seen throughout this epidemic this um uh you know the the figure of the inequities look at the how what percentage of of both black children and hispanics um really over represented if you look at the general population so so a lot of uh black and hispanic kids were affected severely affected with with kobe in the different groups and and this is higher than the than the national uh percentage of black and and hispanic kids so so that was another observation in the general general table uh and they actually did sort of uh a forest plot of what factors are associated with severe disease and definitely uh having a chronic conditions of kids with chronic condition was uh significantly associated with a severe illness also male as i mentioned um and then um the the three younger ages compared to the to the 12 to 18 were also a slightly higher risk of having more severe disease um and then the rest were really non-significant the other um although was more frequently seeing the disease in black and hispanic it was not associated with a clear-cut um more severe disease just more frequent which is at least some some good news in that regard so so for those who actually see children i really invite you to review this paper in detail because it has a lot of information on the general epidemiologic characteristics and demographic characteristics of the kobit epidemic in the us in children the other paper which is also interesting because this is even more severe disease is the it's a report on the multi-inflammatory syndrome in children and i just want to review before we go into the paper the definition this is the definition that they use in this paper that i'm going to review and it's the cdc definition so anybody less than 29 years with fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization and uh with more than two organ systems involved are considered and obviously serologic evidence of sarcoid ii infection in the recent past it's it's what they what defines a multi-inflammatory syndrome uh in children so these authors actually present published this paper in jama pediatrics it's called trends in geographic and temporal distribution of u.s children with with miss during the kobe pandemic this was a cross-sectional study they analyzed patients that made the definition um in a period from march to january so essentially the whole the whole epidemic year of 2020 um and they they actually were able to to after excluding some patients that didn't fit the criteria they were able to find um 1700 children with miss so it's a very robust number of cases interestingly enough again boys are more than 50 percent so boys are more affected more frequent 57 almost 58 percent and again 71 of the cases of miss were in hispanic and non non-hispanic blacks so against the minority disproportionately affected with both kobe and with with this multi-inflammatory syndrome the median age just four for uh it was nine with an interquartile range of five to 13. so so it was seen in all ages but obviously the you know sort of uh nine years old were the median age for these phenomena so not the little little not the older older but the middle of the of the childhood the most common manifestations and i'm just summarizing this also very comprehensive paper were gi symptoms so this is not a respiratory disease gi symptoms rash and conjunctival or ethema so if you see a kid with these symptoms diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain a maculopopular rash and then conjunctival or ethemia you have to think of these even if they have no history of copies before and then look at this 54 had hypotension and shock so this is a very severe disease almost 60 require icu admission so this is no mild uh you know respiratory infection it's it's actually a very severe multisystemic process with high potential and shock any and and and this in this uh group of patients there's a lot of cardiac dysfunction one out of three cardiac dysfunction pericardial diffusion myocarditis in 17.3 even coronary artery dilatation which is the hallmark of kawasaki this is in in almost 16.5 percent uh fortunately the mortality is relatively low although 24 children out of those 1700 die unfortunately of this disease so um a relatively low mortality if you compare with severe copies but but definitely meaningful uh in in this age group and the overall incidence was around two per hundred thousand kids but range in different states from 0.2 to 6.3 the distribution was also interesting um a lot of the cases were diagnosed um in the northeast um and and some in the in the southwest and none and this in this graph the darker the color the more cases of kobe but you can see that even in in areas where there was a lot of cases of copy the the report of of miss was relatively low in several of those states so it's not like a direct relationship between the number of covet pediatric cases and the number of miss there's sort of a difference which could be just reporting that people in the northeast were more we're looking for it more than than people in the midwest or or in the southwest or interesting observation there from the authors and then the other thing which is really interesting is that these cases of misc are usually um two to five weeks after the peaks of of kobe so you have a peak of copied here of copy cases and then a few weeks later you notice the peak in the multi-inflammatory syndrome so it's almost a predictable event like what happens with um with campylobacter and guillain-barre if you have an outbreak of campylobacter or zika for that matter you get a few weeks after the the the peak of cases of campylobacter you get a peak of guillain-barre this is a similar post-infectious phenomenon you you get the peak of copy cases and then later on you're going to see a peak of miss cases all right thank you that's it that's all i had i know i think i took a little bit more than the usual but they were interesting cases thanks nestor uh no abs all so so important and so interesting thank you nestor so so much um great uh questions into the chat already so our next uh our next subject matter expert is dr leslie hayes from espanola dr hayes dr hayes is a primary care physician and addiction specialist hi leslie hayes espanola new mexico and primary care update for today so first off i misspoke last week for some reason i did not think unintentional injuries had gone up but when i looked again they actually did go up fairly substantially for 2020 which makes sense because when i looked both drug overdose deaths went up um the they don't have anything for all of 2020 but what they did find was that for the 12 months ending in may of 2020 it was the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in the u.s which was discouraging because we had been making progress for a while and traffic fatalities also went up by about 4.6 percent and this was despite the fact that driving actually decreased significantly 14 um so the number of um fatalities per vehicular mile traveled um was up to 1.35 per 100 million from 1.10 fatalities um in 2019 and they think that's that even though people were driving less when they were driving they were driving a lot faster and accelerating harder and braking harder and they said all of those just led to an increase in accidents and this one was one that really wasn't a surprise but um did kind of confirm what we all thought which is perinatal outcome is worse for pregnant women who have bad code than if they have mild coven so they surveyed or they studied 1219 patients who were pregnant with a singleton pregnancy and positive covid 47 were asymptomatic mostly tested going in for labor 27 mild 14 moderate 8 severe and 4 critical those with more severe illness did have sort of a tendency towards more complications anyway with higher medium body mass index older age and pre-existing medical comorbidities there were four maternal deaths um that were attributed to covet in this group so there was a six percent incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severe critical illness only 0.2 percent mild to moderate and 0 in asymptomatic and then severe critical severe or critical covid19 was also associated with an increased risk of a lot of different ob complications such as cesarean section 59 versus 34 percent um for a risk relative risk of 1.57 hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 40 versus 18 percent so a relative risk of 1.61 preterm birth was really high 41 versus 11.9 percent or 3.53 and a lot of the preterm births were what we call indicated um births where which is where um as opposed to preterm labor the woman goes into labor and you can't do anything to stop it the baby comes an indicated birth is where the mom is having significant medical problems or the baby is just not doing well and so you choose to have the baby born early and mild or moderate covet 19 really did not have any increase in adverse perinatal outcome so um versus asymptomatic patients so we can assure the patients with asymptomatic or mild moderate covet 19 that they're unlikely to have bad outcomes from the pregnancy related to the covet 19. and we can finally stop the frantic disinfecting cdc updated their guidelines on cleaning surfaces and they state most situations the risk of infection from touching a surface is low the most reliable way to prevent infection from surfaces is to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer instead of cleaning the surfaces repeatedly and if you do not have anyone with confirmed or suspected covid19s who have been in a space cleaning a day once a day is usually enough to sufficiently remove virus disinfecting is a much more intensive process that cleans any it kills any remaining germs on surfaces and that further reduces any risk of spreading infection but they say you either want to clean more frequently or disinfect in addition to cleaning in shared spaces if there's a high transmission of coping 19 in the community a lot of people not wearing masks people are not washing hands frequently or the space is occupied by certain patient populations who may have an increased risk for severe severe illness from cobit 19. and i must say when i saw this i would amaze that any corporation would choose to disinfect or clean more frequently rather than just insist on people wearing masks in the space also obviously if there has been a sick person or someone who tested positive paco19 covid19 in the facility within the last 24 hours you need to clean and disinfect the space and then i was just going to go through i did a talk recently and i realized i didn't really understand herd immunity threshold so i actually went through the math and i found it to be quite useful so i just thought people might find this useful so herd immunity threshold is the percentage of a population that needs to be immune for a pathogen to not be able to continue to be transmitted and when the proportion of individuals in a population is above this number outbreaks will not spread anymore and we all know what r naught is the average number of persons any person with the disease infects in a fully susceptible population a highly communicable pathogen such as measles will have an r out of 12 to 18 and you got to get a lot of the population immune to decrease sustained transmission so the formula needed for herd immunity threshold is 1 minus 1 over r naught and i got to admit i'm a math person and i just looked at this and i was like i have no idea what this means but so i ended up using an example if r naught is 4 which means that every person with a disease will infect four other people so if you have an r not a four if you have 25 people with the disease they are going to infect 100 other people and so here's 25 people on the left with the disease and they're infecting 100 people on the right so if we use the equation for her threshold for her immunity the percentage of people who would need to be immune is 1 minus 1 over r naught or one minus one-fourth or three-fourths or 75 percent so since the herd immunity threshold is 75 you need to get above that in order to decrease transmission so if you have 76 percent of the people are immune 24 of the people would be susceptible so if you had 25 people who are infected instead of being able to infect 100 people like they did before now they would only be able to infect the 25 the 24 of people who are still susceptible so instead of infecting 100 people they would only infect 24 and the total number of people infected will go steadily down rather than up and i could not figure out how to make one of these guys gray so assume that one of these guys is great and you can see these 25 people here on the left will not be able to infect the 75 or 76 percent of um people on the right who are immune so they'll only infect 24 and again the numbers will go steadily down and that was everything i had thank you leslie that was fantastic i think you should write an article using those using the smiley faces i'd have to figure out how to turn number the the last guy gray i could not figure that one out so you brought that down to my level for sure um thank you for that um and thank you for the great talk um uh we have uh marla sepers is here today it's so exciting and and she has a presentation for us marla's an epidemiologist with the new mexico department of health one of our hub team members thanks marla okay thanks everyone uh hopefully you can see my screen yes thank you so i wanted to just briefly uh share some vaccine updates um there were several changes that happened to the vaccine program in new mexico over the last week so i just wanted to update everyone on those and make sure they hadn't been missed as of april 5th everyone age 16 and older is eligible for a vaccination in new mexico so no longer doing the tiered implementation approach that we had been previously now everyone is able to be vaccinated as of april 8th those who are age 60 and older do not need an event code and can self-schedule through the new mexico department of health vaccine portal so you'll remember when we began vaccinating we were trying to prioritize certain groups and people had to wait to get an event code basically an invitation to come to a vaccine event people who are age 60 and older no longer need to wait for that invitation they can create their profile on the portal and see vaccines that are available in their area and self-schedule for that vaccine if you don't see a vaccine event in your area in the next day or two check back because new events are added um all the time so if you don't see one close enough that you would like check back because there will be likely additional ones added and another change is that everyone is able to self-schedule their second dose or their booster dose through the vaccine portal if they uh need a booster dose so previously you had to either be scheduled by the provider who had given your initial dose or you had to wait until you got again an event code from department of health inviting you to come to an event where you could get your booster now you can self schedule so if you go get your initial dose and they don't automatically give you a second dose of white appointment you can log in and get that scheduled for yourself at the appropriate interval and at a location of your choosing and some good news as of yesterday 53 percent of new mexicans age 16 and older have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 35 percent of new mexicans are fully vaccinated so we are you know making good progress towards that hurt immunity through vaccination in new mexico and just wanted to share that the department of health aging and long-term services and other community members have continued to roll out new mobile vaccine clinics each week so that we're able to reach people who are homebound or people in rural communities that might not have easy access to vaccine so trying to make scheduling a vaccine and getting a vaccine in new mexico easier for people as we have better more sustainable supplies and just a quick update about vaccinating children you may have heard that pfizer submitted their official eua expansion request on friday to fda for approval to begin using their vaccine in adolescents age 12 to 15. their clinical trials are still ongoing for younger children but this would expand vaccination access to children age 12 and older and the phase 2 3 trials of the madonna vaccine began in ages 12 to 17 in december the company says that they expect to submit data from this trial to the fda in spring of 2021 so we're expecting to see some data from moderna for that age group soon and they're expanding their vaccine trial to children ages 6 through 12 this month or last month in march and johnson johnson also announced that they are going to begin their phase 2 trials for ages 12 to 17 on april 2nd so if the fda approves pfizer and moderna's eua expansion request we can likely start to expect that we can vaccinate at least middle and high school age children before the next school year so that'll be exciting progress so the other topic i wanted to share some information about today is vaccine effectiveness surveillance so you'll remember that cdc and new mexico department of health began our vaccine effectiveness surveillance back at the beginning of the year so as people started to get vaccinated we needed to start tracking um how often breakthrough cases occur after people have been fully vaccinated um so you know part of the reason we do this is to see if vaccines offer the same level of protection that we saw in clinical trials and so that we can improve and refine our vaccine recommendations and our vaccine rollout so as we know there are many factors that can affect how the vaccine works in real world conditions uh host factors people who may not have been included in the clinical trials may react differently and have different levels of immunity to the vaccine and so far we've seen a lot of good news about this and vaccine effectiveness always a question about how variants may affect vaccine effectiveness and then programmatic factors when you're not administering all of your vaccines in a clinical trial do we see differences in efficacy based on how closely people are following the dosing schedules or other programmatic factors like vaccine storage and handling so we sent out a han advisory on february 15th which was basically a call for cases asking providers to help us identify these vaccine breakthrough cases so in addition to us being able to detect them through our routine surveillance and case investigation asking providers to help alert us to these cases as well so the case definition is a resident who has a positive sars kobe 2 test that can either be a pcr and antigen test collected from a respiratory specimen greater or 14 days or more after completing their full dosing schedule of an fda authorized vaccine i just wanted to share um some data since we began that surveillance so in new mexico so far we have identified 169 vaccine breakthrough cases so these are cases by specimen collection date so you'll see our earliest vaccine breakthrough case identified back at the end of january and this data runs through the week of april 5th so the days between final dose and specimen collection so that point from when we would consider somebody fully vaccinated until their positive sars cov2 respiratory specimen was collected you can see we have a wide range here of 14 to 83 days with a median of 33 days and a median of 30 days post vaccine interestingly a little more than a third of the people who had a breakthrough case had no symptoms and of those who were symptomatic headache fatigue and runny nose were the most commonly reported symptoms among that group again about a little more than a third reported no underlying conditions so people who didn't have any underlying conditions that we would suspect would make them have a less effective immune response to vaccine people who did have underlying conditions heart disease was the most commonly reported condition chronic lung disease like copd or asthma diabetes being a former smoker and then a little more than 14 of these breakthrough cases of these 169 cases reported sometimes some type of immunocompromising condition as an underlying condition so you see we have people who were hiv positive people who had cancer lupus immunocompromised you know self-reported as immunocompromised or having an autoimmune disorder so one thing to keep in mind is that these data are very preliminary we're looking at small numbers um three of these cases were hospitalized with conditions that were likely covid related and there were two deaths among this group of 169 cases who had coveted listed as a contributing cause of death but not the immediate or underlying cause on their death certificate so so far the vaccine breakthrough cases by vaccine type are proportional to the vaccine distribution so we're not seeing that there's one particular vaccine product which is having more breakthrough cases it really is proportional to the number of vaccines that have been distributed among the population we need more sequencing data to know if breakthrough cases are being driven by certain variants um you know the sequencing data is really being done for public health surveillance purposes it's not um you know actionable clinical data you're not able to get those sequencing results back uh quickly enough to change your clinical management um so it's really for surveillance purposes and we just don't have enough of those specimens that have been sequenced to really draw any conclusions about these 169 breakthrough cases yet um statewide uh the rate of vaccine breakthrough is 42.6 cases per hundred thousand people fully vaccinated so less than one percent and you can see that data about number fully vaccinated at the cv vaccine nmhealth.org public dashboard so vaccines are very effective against preventing severe disease hospitalization and death we see that in our surveillance data in new mexico as well as the national data but obviously not a hundred percent effective against infection some people who are vaccinated can still become infected but so far the incidence appears to be very low less than one percent among vaccinated folks so you should continue even after being vaccinated to protect yourself for infection wear a mask avoid crowds poorly ventilated indoor spaces wash your hands often and you should get tested if you develop symptoms regardless of vaccination status and i think i meant to include a slide here um and it doesn't look like it made it into this version but we do see among these 169 cases slightly more women than men it's about 60 40 60 women 40 men again um it may be too early to draw any conclusions from that you know we think uh women are more likely to have health seeking behaviors so may go ahead go ahead and get tested if they develop symptoms after vaccination and women are over represented in a workforce which is being surveillance tested at this point so people who work in health care people who work in long-term care settings so we're likely picking up more asymptomatic infections among women than men currently in new mexico so we'll continue to watch that trend and it may sort of even out over time as we get a larger more representative sample thanks thank you marla um so important all the information from uh how we're doing here in new mexico to the breakthrough cases uh really really appreciate your uh talk um i'd just like to briefly introduce uh carissa culbreth who's the medical director at tricor labs carissa are you here would you yes be able to say hi do you have any um announcements or anything to share today or would you be willing to answer any laboratory questions sure happy to answer any um laboratory questions today um no updates um but thank you for having us absolutely and um i'm going to turn it over to dr thornton thank you everybody thank you very much um i just actually i have one question marla just because of the data you just presented is that data um similar to what other states are seeing or is there's other state-level data i haven't seen much data from other states yet i've seen a couple of news reports but all of this information is being aggregated by cdc and i know cdc is currently analyzing all of this state data so i'm expecting we'll see an mmwr or some other publication um that gives a picture of what's happening around the country over the next couple of weeks great thank you um i'm not sure who can answer this but eva anjali has the question are how are the different variants affecting clinical presentation in children is that something that you ran across nestor yeah i can mention i remember uh publication out of the uk when the uk variant the 117 was circulating they saw sort of a discrete uh increase in the proportion of children affected it was like you know from a very low percentage was still low but slightly higher percentage of kids affected um that's that's as much as i think as i can say and with the with the brazilian variant i think i review a paper a few days ago here in which they actually saw an increase in the case fatality ratio of younger groups like 20 to 29 uh and so on so so that's what i know that there's like like a higher proportion of of younger uh without being you know something dramatic that will that changes the whole natural history of the disease which which obviously affect elderly much more than young but there's a slightly increase in the proportion of younger people affected with at least the uk and the p1 variant that i have seen thank you and while we're on the subject of children joanna asked is there guidance from cdc for kids with chronic diseases to remain with remote learning i don't know if marla if you you know the answer to that yeah cdc doesn't make a strong recommendation that kids with underlying health conditions or kids who live in households maybe where someone might have underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to severe illness remain in remote learning but they do say that the option should be maintained for those families but they don't make a strong recommendation that it's preferred they just tell school districts that remote learning should remain as an option for those families great thank you and um cindy johnson is asking is there anyone familiar with evidence that the vaccination helps symptoms for long haulers i know we talked about this a little bit but i don't know if anyone's seen any any further data no no not not not really uh nothing new i just keep hearing the same comment in different podcasts and there was a pre-publication uh with uh with some decrease in the symptoms um but that's as far as i have seen i think we're waiting for like a more robust uh you know prospective study in which they they actually document the the changes in the symptoms thank you i don't know leslie and marla did you have any comments about that no just what i haven't seen anything else just what dr sosa said okay thank you is there um kim joy's asking is there any current data on how long the vaccine will be effective will we will we be needing a booster in six months well uh both moderna and pfeister have already uh published on the duration of some of the earlier trials the duration of the anti antibodies and the levels of neutralizing antibodies seems to be you know high uh up to six months which is like the longest uh published um story so so at least six months i don't think we're going to need a uh necessarily a boost at six months but the evidence shows that at least at six months most of the participants in this trial do sustain a pretty decent um antibody level so that's what we know so far i i don't think anybody has mentioned specifically when we're going to get if we're going to get a a booster if it's going to be at nine or a 12 month et cetera i don't think that data is out but at least what they have published is that the levels are there six months after vaccination uh oh if you see the shape of the curve it's going down but it's like a very uh you know not a very steep uh decrease it's sort of a you know mild down slope in six months and it's still pretty high at that at that moment so hopefully it will be longer than that in my opinion so there's not any clear guidance at this point yeah um yehuda pat is asking is there what is known about the efficacy of the chinese and the russian vaccines okay there have been a couple of pre-publications with the effectiveness because i haven't seen really efficacy of the chinese maxim but the corona back that is being used in in south america the the effectiveness both in chile and brazil which are the paper that i have seen it's around 50 to 56 percent so it's it's kind of low uh compared to the 94 95 and this is for just disease just preventing disease it's much higher for severe disease but but that's what i've seen 50 um four i think and 56 percent were the number if i remember correctly uh in in brazil and chile respectively of the chinese the the russian vaccine in the study the phase 3 it had 91 percent efficacy for preventing disease it was in the high in the 90s at least the the sputnik vaccine the two doses of the of the sputnik vaccine but the chinese and this i think made into the news like one chinese official i think his last name was gao mentioned that you know that the response was not very robust it was around 50 to 60 percent efficacy so that's that's sort of been uh also commented in the in the in the press in the lay press thank you very much i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme um the feedback uh link went in about 12 43 so if you're interested in seeing me please fill that out and we would love to have your feedback um i wanted to go back to nestor the complications of the vaccine that you presented early there's a question from sherry hastick if someone has history of itp should they avoid the vaccine i haven't seen anything specific about that i can tell you anecdotally i have had a couple of uh relatives or friends or patients that that had uh itp and they have been vaccinated without any relapse in there and they were both in remission of their itp and and they they receive the mrna was seen and not nothing happened um but i haven't seen any official guidance if you have like you know itp or you had a history of ttp or or hit heparin induce trouble cytopenia if you should or should not receive an adenovirus by saying i haven't seen that from any of the of the things that i that i read thank you very much um harry seibold is asking nestor if you can comment or give your gut feeling about the p1 cluster reported in canada oh yeah i i just saw the news uh it was kind of worrisome i mean there were according to the news there were a lot of cases in one of the news outlets i saw over a thousand cases i don't know if they genotype everybody but they were a large case uh outbreak and and it affected young healthy uh hockey players which are people who are in top shape so and they they the news said that they were really ill getting oxygen hydration etc so it sounds like uh almost like a like a repeat of what i'm listening from my colleagues in brazil that even if you're young you still you know you can be you know pretty pretty uh pretty severely affected by this p1 variant which is what we're seeing in south america but that's as much as i know i haven't seen any publication just just the the news and i think there was another outbreak of p1 in cape cod here in the u.s so it's not just in canada there's like small outbreaks in a couple of places and obviously in in other countries in in latin america it is becoming more prevalent like chile panama that i've seen the the the genetic stories they're starting to see more community transmission of p1 outside brazil thank you nestor i'm going to turn it back over to joanna but i just wanted to ask um bonnie cavanaugh asked if there was any support groups for postcovid uh people with postcovid syndrome if anybody knows about if you do know about those please put them into the chat and joanna i'm going to turn it back over to you great thanks carla so much i'm going to just hit on some of the vaccine questions and go a little bit out of order here um um dr seibold asked some would there be contraindications to le dr hayes answered that one would there be contraindications to um a monocle antibodies to high-risk persons with vaccine breakthrough cases and dr hayes um answered that and said uh no that they should be kind of treated um as if they hadn't had the vaccine and then donna orgaron asks i'm just kind of out of curiosity why did uh why did pfizer go back to the fda and ask for um uh prototype thank you and ask for um you know state that they could um hold their pfizer with them at a higher temperature do you know why that occurred nestor no i think i think they did a stability testing but that's as smart as now i know the they they re the fights are requested officially for from the european amazing agencies the change in the labeling or allowing them to go to from -25 to -15 which is a which is up you know easier to to find a freezer with those temperatures than a minus 80 freezer so for preservation at least for a couple of weeks that's what they did great thank you i wanted to go over this kind of a real like a a tiny kind of case scenario from david tempest he says if you have a if you have an asymptomatic fully vaccinated person to test negative uh with the pcr reference lab test who then has a positive pre-procedure rapid test two days later would you what would you consider this would you consider this a a breakthrough test or how would you what would you consider this is a scenario i have my ideas but wanted to hear from the experts i mean i'm going to make a comment and then i'd like uh carissa to comment i mean one possibility is that it's obviously a real thing that he was really negative when they did the pcr and two days later his viral antigen and viral load increase and it was positive so that's a possibility uh the other is a false positive of the antigen test which is obviously less uh the pcr tends to be better than an antigen or a rapid test so it could be a false positive from the antigen test so he doesn't have infection it's just a false positive those would be my my feeling um and this applies even to vaccinator or unvaccinated subjects and what i have seen published is that vaccinated breakthrough infections tend to have a slightly lower viral load so i guess you know it's these issues of sensitivity are more relevant with vaccinated patients because they may not have a high wire load and half copied but with a slightly lower viral load because they're partially immune from from having received the vaccine but i don't know carissa if you have any any more comments on that because that's a diagnostic test question yeah no i think exactly the same um i think any time especially with a rapid test when there's an unexpected result um that we should look for some confirmatory testing particularly with the antigen test because they do tend to have a little bit less sensitivity as we're all aware but as the disease prevalence starts to go down then we start to lose some specificity you think back to flu testing rapid antigen testing for flu we tend not to do that outside of flu season because there's a higher likelihood that the positive test would be a false positive just based on the community prevalence and so i think we're now starting to get to the time with kova testing that for antigen um especially rapid antigen testing we really need to be thoughtful about the positive results and there may be a need to confirm positive results and that would be my recommendation in in this patient to just do some confirmatory testing to find out if we if we truly have a positive case thanks carissa um do you think we should automatically just kind of do an automatic confirmatory test or not necessarily so you know those decisions are often prevalence-based um and then you know what is the downstream action going to be i think right now we still are in a very heightened state around covid um that a positive test and a symptomatic individual should certainly be considered as a positive but a rapid antigen test and an asymptomatic previously vaccinated individual should probably be confirmed before going down the pathway of vaccine breakthrough and then the in the impact to any individuals that person's been in contact with right in their isolation and their their quarantine so i think we're we're starting to get into that space for for rapid antigen tests i think thanks carissa and nestor very helpful um i think we have time for one more question i'm wondering if dr broyles uh is there and i'd like to get your question in dr briles julie are you could you and mute um hi thanks very much it was just a quick question i'm sure we're trying to get everybody who's you know compromised um immunized and i wonder if there's any data or anything that i can pass on to patients as i'm vaccinating them or any data about efficacy no unfortunately most of the large trial the the modern physical and the other trials in their inclusion and exclusion criteria they they purposely exclude patients with like an overwhelming immunodeficiency and actually not even there were some patients with hiv and they have not published the results on the hiv that i know of so so we're still waiting for for more data on on sub population i know that some of the pharmaceutical companies are planning to do studies on immunosuppressed and chronic comorbidity patients on purpose now looking for like how well it works in in renal patients how well it works in hiv positive patients but i haven't seen any data of of that we just as you as you pointed out we're vaccinating them in good faith but we don't have a lot of information about it thank you very much um we're about a minute before uh one o'clock mountain time wanted to thank you all we still have a few more great questions that we'll try to get to next week uh dr angeli asked about vaccine passports and dr saltman asked about requiring covet uh vaccines for college so we'll try to get to some of these next week and uh want to remind you we have the first responder resiliency echo at two o'clock today mountain time and i think we have the critical do we have the critical care echo this week carla yeah it is um to be determined the the topic but critical care echo on thursday at 8 o'clock right thank you carla and then we also have the substance houston chronic pain echo on thursday at 12 at 12 noon thank you everybody so much for your great engagement with us and participation and we'll see you again next week thank you to our our hub team,,4/12/2021
45,good afternoon everyone welcome to the infectious diseases copen 19 office hours today well really nice to see everybody um i just have a couple housekeeping announcements and then we'll turn it over to nestor sosa um if you have questions during the during this session please put them into the chat and we'll try to get to all the questions we got a lot of questions last week but we'll try to get to all of the ones we can this week if you we would also ask that if you have a camera you would turn it on because we would love to see your faces we'd love to build community here at project echo um also if you um put questions into the chat and if you um we ask that you not answer other people's questions in the chat if they're directed at the hub team members and i want to just introduce myself on carl thornton infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i also want to introduce the co my co-facilitator joanna katzman joanna do you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo in university of new mexico welcome great thank you so much and just a couple of other uh other things today marla sivers our department of health uh expert who's usually with us is on vacation we're very happy for her and leslie hayes is as well so it's going to be nestor alone today like the old days um and i do not know there he is okay luckily nestor's here so um we're gonna go ahead and turn it over to him and we'll start with his um with his slides hi nestor do you want to introduce yourself sorry sorry for the delay i was trying to find the microphone once you open the the big screen you i lose the microphone hello everyone uh let's um go over our updates so but so we have more time i don't have to like run through my presentation like i usually do so i'll i'll go at a slower pace and we can enjoy some of these publications so first i wanted to start with some good news there was more um news communicated from from regeneron one of the companies that produce the monoclonal antibodies they actually in their webpage they uh reveal the results of one of the large phase three trials and this is using the monoclonal as prevention of disease so it's actually sort of a passive real passive immunity um and and what they they communicated was basically the following they said the prevention trial showed an 81 reduce risk of symptomatic uh sars coe2 infections with the use of subcutaneous administration of regen cough which is the the combination of two monoclonal uh cassidy map and in debbie map and they actually interestingly enough you said sub-q so that opens the the the ease of administration to other places not only hospital but it could be given in other in other settings with less complex nursing or medical support so that was interesting and and this this this was a double-blind placebo control study in which they included asymptomatic and obviously in uninfected household contacts of people with kobe and the exposure have to be less than four days so it's basically you know the typical example if your spouse or your brother in the same household is diagnosed probably they will offer an injection of of 1200 milligrams of of this regeneron monoclonal antibody and then they follow these cases and see who got infected and if they if they got infected who were symptomatic asymptomatic and what was the viral load so it was sort of an attempt to to protect uh people especially people that have not received the vaccine or are unable to mount a response to the vaccine this this would be the ideal use for this preparation and they actually share these tables on their web page this is not a publication again i i this is just a press release but it almost looks like a table from a from a study so they found an overall 81 percent reduction in symptomatic disease so those who got the the regeneron um did not develop disease uh in the same proportion of those who who were in the placebo arm and actually the protection was even higher in opposed the first week meaning that probably it was 72 in the first week and after the first week 93 so probably these some of these patients were already incubating the disease when they were injected um so you can see the protection was more robust after a couple of weeks probably ruling out ruling out the the fact that they were incubated this is when they were uh given the regeneron so definitely definitely a very high level of protection the other important uh thing is that the if you develop the disease if you fell ill with kobe despite the regeneron the duration of the disease was shorter 1.2 weeks so basically one week week versus three weeks of of illness if you did not develop the the regeneron so very significant also the p was very significant reduction in the duration of the disease and even the viral load uh was also um um significantly uh um shortened with with the with in the treatment are 0.4 versus 1.3 number of weeks with a positive viral load in those who got infected so definitely at least in this press relief evidence of of protection so if you have a person that it's uh unable to get the vaccine and they are exposed to covet in theory they can be offered this therapy so obviously regeneron is going to ask for an inclusion in their emergency use authorization by the fda inclusion of this indication uh as post-exposure prophylaxis or passive immunization so interesting very positive result with this monoclonal antibody and again as i said it was subcutaneous so it doesn't even need like an er visit it can be given in a less a complex setting and also i didn't mention it but the side effects were basically comparable in the placebo and the regeneron very little difference between placebo and and the and the monoclonal in terms of serious diversity injection related adverse events so it was really very very well tolerated and the second news i basically um mentioned something about this uh uh when we had the meeting last week but the news had not been uh uh already communicated but i mentioned that there was some concern especially in europe with the j j pacinos and as you know the johnson and johnson one of the adenoviruses vaccine the single dose that was going to be uh used here in the u.s as one of the three um approved vaccinations is is pause or their administration is possible the the authorities are analyzing this phenomenon of the trombonic event so i want to go in a little bit more detail into these uh thrombotic events um and actually the cdc if you look at the cdc webpage they they posted a hannah health alert network um mentioned in this phenomenon of the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with trombocytopenia after the receive of johnson and johnson kobe 19 maxine and it's been no longer the news so you can read more information at the cdc.gov webpage about this and i just want to mention because the most striking finding was this cavernous sinus thrombosis i just want to go over some because i mean this is not something that we see all the time so the cavernous sinus is sort of a of a venus lake inside the bones of the skull and it's located right right behind the eye so here would be the eye so it's sort of behind the eye and it's actually like the confluence of many of these important venus um systems inside the inside the skull they they actually draining this area and this is an area where the blood flow is kind of slow it's sort of of a lake of blood if you if you if you can use this this um term so so it's one of the areas where there's blood clotting in these in these vaccinated subjects in the cavernous sinus and this is a very critical area because in in the in cavernous dinos there's a lot of important structures there are several cranial nerves that go through the cavernous sinus and even the carotid artery the internal carotid artery is within this this venous leg or venous sinus inside the brain so it's a very delicate very critical so you have thrombosis of that you can uh easily explain a lot of the neurological findings because of of damage to the to the nerves or other structures that are in close proximity we usually see cavernous sinus thrombosis in infectious disease when there is like an infection for instance of the sphenoid uh sinus when there's sphenoid sinus sinusitis sometimes the infection uh produces a clotting of the blood inside the same sinus but obviously this is a completely different phenomenon associated with the vaccine and in fact in the cdc uh web pages what they reported so far are um you know out of 6.85 million doses of jnj given in the u.s we have six reports of cavernous sinus from bostis and these patients all had less than 150 000 platelets but that was like the combination of the of the finding that actually was the alert in the in the vaccine adverse event uh reporting system in the virus uh so it's if you if you make a simple uh division here it's one almost one in a million or a little bit less than one in a million um so it's it's a very infrequent event but nevertheless rare and and and in one case was lethal the onset of this complication was between six and 13 days after vaccination and actually median time from vaccination to hospitalization with the complication was 15 days so it's not something that happens immediately after the vaccine like an hour or a day it's actually more like a couple of weeks after 10 days to a couple of weeks after the vaccination and the range goes from 10 to 17 days uh between the the vaccination and hospitalization interestingly enough six out of six subjects uh with this event were female so 100 at least in this um the us um and relatively young 18 to 48 if you think that that a lot of elderly people receive the vaccine this phenomenon has been recognized mostly in young um females half of them were obese but the other half were not uh and none had a history of any coagulation uh disorder so they were you know presumably healthy from the hematologic point of view so so that that's basically the description of the phenomenon the five out of six the presenting symptom was headaches so they have headache one out of out of of the six have back pain but then develop headaches so we can say that almost a hundred percent six out of six develop headache four oxy six had also neurologic syndromes like blur vision localized weakness etc uh and one presented with abdominal pain nausea and vomiting and this all also reminds me that there were clotting in other areas when they studied this patient they found also clotting in in the splatnic uh circulation meaning the portal vein or the mesenteric veins inside the abdomen so it's not just a cavernous sinus but there is clotting in other places and even disseminated into a vascular population in i think one of the patients the other thing that i mentioned all had low platelets so that's another hallmark of the disease and actually the range was between 10 000 which is very low to 120 000 uh and there was also pairing intraparenchymal bleeding in four hours because you have thrombosis but you have trouble cytopenia and bleeding so so you can have both uh bleeding and thrombosis in the in the in the patient out of these six so far one have died two have recovered and were discharged and three at the moment of this analysis remain hospitalized and in also interesting from the diagnostic standpoint five out of five tests it's all of the those who have the test for the pf4 or plate activating antibodies against the um protein factor four in the platelets were positive so all of them had this anti-pf4 antibody which is also the diagnostic whole market of these the the production of these antips4 antibodies and what is pa4 pf4 basically it's called plated factor four it's actually a 70 amino acid protein also known as chemokine ligand iv or cxcl4 but i think you know it's more better known as ps4 it's a it's a protein that is normally released by the alpha granules the playlists have these granules that have this ps4 and they they participate in the normal um coagulation physiology so they they um they are released by activated platelets and promote um blood coagulation um by moderate moderating the effects of heparin-like molecules so it's a physiologic function but what we think is happening here is that um antibodies are produced against this pf4 and and this antibody are conducive of platelet aggregation and this is what happened exactly with the heparin industrial homocytopenia and with the pf4 it's complex with um with heparin and then the antibodies actually cross link the platelets uh using the fc receptor in the platelet surface and there is like platelet aggregation plated activation and and and scientists think that this is the same phenomenon except that there's no heparin here no natural no no pharmacological use of heparin is actually something in the vaccine that is triggering these auto antibodies against pf4 and those antibodies together with the pf4 are mediating these um platelet aggregations so that's that's what we know uh about this so far so what do i think are the the future of this adenovirus there are several things happening obviously the paws have been extended they want actually to look at more subjects because when they did the analysis there were a lot of of subjects who had received the johnson and joseph vaccine were less than two weeks so we just by waiting a few days we're gonna have another um close to three million people who already had the vaccine and have completed uh those 14 days after the vaccine and see if we see more of this phenomenon so the real alternative is just continue the vaccination so maybe the cc will say you know we're gonna put this in context it's one in a in a million it's a really really rare and and the advantages um of the vaccines it's greater than the risk so we're going to continue another another strategy would be to continue the the vaccines but limited for certain either age or gender maybe just use it on males like some countries are doing or maybe only people over 50 years and with the risk of dying of coffee is higher than the risk of of having this adverse event this rare bets event and the other thing would be not using it all together i mean if if the the cases keep piling up and we see that it's more common that initially perceive there may be governments um that may not use it all together because they have other vaccines so those are i think some of the some of the possibilities going going forward and we can discuss in the session of question and answer the other key question that i think for me as a as a physician as an investigator it's really what component of the vaccine is causing this autoimmune reaction because remember there's a lot of people who have received also the sputnik vaccine which is an adenovirus vaccine in other places in other countries so what component of is the adenovirus itself is is is the spike protein that is being produced uh it's a contaminant in these adenovirus vaccines or something we don't really know i have read a couple of papers speculating about what could the trigger for this for the production of this pf4 and the other thing is you know we so far we have seen females young but um it's true that a lot of people who have been vaccinated because they're healthcare workers there a lot of them are female so this really a real um greater incidence in female or males can also have it and i read that in the phase three trial of of johnson and so there was one male who had cabernet synonymous thrombosis so at least there's one report of this complication in in males um and also maybe the age we say they're all young but but again maybe maybe not we're not recognizing this complication in other in the elderly because you know you expect the elderly to have strokes or or cns complication more more frequently than than young so maybe it's it's um it's been picked up because this is a young person developing but it could be also happening in the early but we're just not picking it up so i think those are questions that are still open and obviously the question of sputnik um if it's going to be affected also i hope the countries that are using this vaccine are doing a robust uh monitoring of their cases and finally if we eliminate this adenovirus vaccine is that going to affect i think definitely it's going to affect the the kobe response in the in the global scale because a lot of countries were counting on either astra seneca or johnson and johnson to vaccinate their population so it's going to be a large impact around the world because these are vaccines that do not require the street uh frozen temperature et cetera so so it was really convenient and johnson and jose was one though so that's another advantage that we're losing in this case okay so obviously i have to mention something about the variance variance of concern and there were some two publications in the la into all the lancet uh journals about good news about the voc or variants of concerns specifically the the the british or uk varian the first paper was this paper called genomic characteristics and clinical effect of the emergence horoscope ii uh b117 this is the uk in london so what these authors did they look at the patients actually hospitalized with kobe in the time between november and december of last year when the the b117 was becoming more frequent so there were patients with no b b117 and we be of b117 so with variance of concern and non-variants are concerned they actually compare the severity of disease and what they found which was reassuring and it was a sort of different to what had been uh reported before it was that severe disease or death um prevalence ratio was similar in both the boc and non-blc patients there was no significant difference in the severity of disease with either with or without the the uk variant so what that was that was really reassuring in this well-conducted study and and the only thing that they did did confirm was that the viral load was higher in those with with the variance so and that sort of explained probably why it's more transmissible at least from this paper um this paper is is contradicting previous reports of more severity with the b117 and as you know this is the more frequent um variant in the united states so it's definitely good news this was published in the landsat infectious disease and these are basically the distribution of the severe cases and death and you can see that just at a glance the the incidence is very similar of severe disease and death with both the non-boc and blc across a different age group maybe a small difference here in the mortality and the younger folks but definitely not a statistically significant so the conclusion of this paper more transmissible but not more severe and that was good news and there was another paper also from from the uk this is sort of a population um report of people with the that use that the app to report uh reinfections in the us thirty six thousand in the uk i'm sorry thirty six thousand nine hundred and twenty app users uh who who were followed for the the development of reinfection they found no changes in the symptoms so there was no difference in the clinical presentation and and disease duration with the b117 or with non biba 117 patients and also no evidence of a greater frequency of reinfection so two two publications sort of diffusing a little bit the concern that we all have with these new variants um uh and definitely this demonstrated an increase in the in the transmissibility also so apparently more robust data that definitely this b117 is more transmissible but necessary not necessarily more severe so good news in the front and my favorite article that this is me and my my bicycle my favorite article of the week and this sort of a personal story when in the beginning of the pandemic there was no treatment no vaccine nothing and i thought the only thing i can do is like to try to stay in shape and do exercise in case i ended up in the icu that was sort of my crazy idea so i increased my my exercise during the the pandemic and long and behold this group actually published that physical inactivity is associated with a higher risk of severe kobe 19 so so my gut feeling that i needed to be in good shape to survive kobe was right they did a retrospective review almost 50 000 subjects in in case kaiser permanente southern california uh health system um they actually had information on the activity level of these subjects from the ehr they they uh apparently they do as a routine they do what they call exercise vital signs so every time the patient goes to the to the clinic they asking how many times a week do you exercise in the last two months and how many minutes do you exercise and they have this sort of uh information on all of these subjects on what their level of activity and they actually classify consistently inactive those who did less than 10 minutes a week some activity 11 to 149 and then consistently active which is like the cdc recommendation more than 150 days of at least breeze walking or some type of physical exercise and then they correlated this information from the pre-pandemic era on these subjects with their their outcomes in if they got kobe and what they found that the risk of hospitalization was two times a higher 2.5 times higher the icu admission and risk of death also 2. almost 2.5 so risk if you were inactive versus consistently active so there was a clear a clear protection if you if you can can use that that term protection from being physically active as opposed to and this was a multi-variable logistic regression so he included all the fractures like obesity hypertension diabetes so this was significant after adjusting for probable confounders and even if you were inactive versus some activity there was still some some protection obviously not as robust but a 20 a 10 and a 32 a higher risk of having either hospitalization icu admission and death if you were inactive so it's a good thing to stay active during a pandemic you know to try to decrease your risk of of being hospitalized et cetera and obviously why is this we know this from previous studies we know that exercising improved immune function there's lower incident intensity and mortality with other viral infections have been published with influenza and some other obviously exercise reduces systemic inflammation that we know is part of the pathophysiology of kovid and also obvious cardiovascular benefits increase lung capacity increase muscle strength so you if you end up in an icu you're probably better off if you're if you're in good shape as opposed to if you have like um you're not physically fit and also improve mental health which i found this interesting at least if you have better mental health probably more likely to behave appropriately use mass social distance as opposed to to a person who who um who's depressed or or not following uh things because of emotional or other psychological reasons and obviously their indirect effects of exercise over obesity diabetes and hypertension that we all know very well okay so that was my update for today thank you thank you very much nestor for that excellent update and your personal experience with exercise congratulations so that's great um before we move on to questions i wanted to introduce our colleagues from tricor carissa culbreth are you on video you're not on my screen but i wanted you to introduce yourself and also if you have any updates that you would like to give us hi karissa kobreth the medical director for infectious disease diagnostics at tricor and just a reminder to all of our colleagues on the line this is medical laboratory professionals week so make sure that you go to wherever your lab is or send them an email and say thank you for all of the hard work they do for covit and for everything else and so that's my only update for today happy to answer any questions thank you chris and cecilia thompson is i believe also on i don't know cecilia if you had any anything any updates hey i don't have anything to update i would second chris's comment um to thank your favorite laboratory professional for all that they do great thank you well i'm thanking you guys publicly here on echo for all of the work that you do in the lab uh very very critical to our to us doing a good job in medicine all right um i am going to turn it over to joanna to start with questions great thank you carla uh thank you nestors so much for that outstanding presentation today and and every week just amazing um going to start with um dr seibold's question um it's about the regeneron monocle antibody nester he's uh and harry says um is the regeneron monocle antibody only for those high risk people or for all patients is only for use with patients developing symptoms or can it be used after a known exposure prior to symptoms or proposed exposure prophylaxis right so far it's just a proof for um for patients who who have copied or are beginning copied in the sa and they have the risk factor the same risk factor that that are described for eli lilly so over 65 obesity et cetera the risk factors that are in the eu of all the eli lily and and and and the general product um the hope for for the general company for this product is that that the indication will be broadened to basically include a high-risk exposure let's say a person who did not get the vaccine because i had like an underlying disease and it's exposed either at home or some other setting to a person with kobe then maybe you can offer the monoclonal obviously if you're being vaccinated and you're fully immunized there's probably no use but but i can i can think of patients like renal transplant patient patients with the congenital immunodeficiencies that are not able to produce and if they get exposed to copy they can offer they can be offered but this is not approved yet they're gonna actually present the data from the phase three to the fda to to have this indication in their in their uh portfolio but not it's not um available for that at this point it's it's the hope of rainieron to have it um to use use it that way as a prophylactic especially in groups that have not been vaccinated or they have not mounted a good response on the vaccine or they are susceptible to infection because of other reasons immunological recent genetic reasons et cetera thank you nester it reminds me how it reminds me of what's what's kind of going on in michigan and how the federal agencies are not shipping more vaccines to michigan but said they were going to be shipping more monoclonal antibodies and i'm wondering kind of how how that's being handled and if it's helping or working or if they're if patients are really coming in to get to get treatment um john foster says related to the same thing is there any talk of loosening criteria for monoclonal antibodies john do you want to unmute and ask this tell us about uh this patient of yours yeah can you hear me yes absolutely yeah so there was a patient that was seen in our er last week who they considered monoclonal antibodies but he was 53 he he barely missed the criteria because if he had been 55 he would have met criteria because he has hypertension so he did not get it and then and now last night he got admitted now now hypoxic and and so it there there we have it seems like at least in taos we have a an abundance of supply of the monoclonal antibody and and we would like to be using it more often it would be nice to be able to give it to more people and i'm just wondering if there's any thought about kind of loosening those um criteria that they're defined as the high-risk conditions great question john yeah great question i i don't know the answer i agree with you i mean there are some cases in which you i mean a 53 54 year old with underlying condition it's it's almost painful not to give it to him because he's not 55 so yeah i agree it's definitely something that that hopefully the fda will will consider now that we have more data on safety because at the beginning there was really no not too much data but now we have a couple of phase three both in prevention and therapy and especially early on they seem to be very effective the diminishing hospitalization symptomatic disease even viral shedding or viral load decreases also duration of disease so um i think it's it's yeah your question is right on the spot i can i can also share a case that i had here uh we had a patient who had like a complete inability to produce antibodies he has excellent agama global anemia and he had a prolonged covet um you know he got infected in march and still in april was still very sick with fever elevated inflammatory markers and i actually requested permission to use the in this case was the eli lily because he had no ability to produce antibodies and we gave him the the monoclonal sort of you know outside the eua with you know with the consent of the patient and my sort of responsibility and i don't know it was a coincidence or what but the patient got much better uh 48 hours after the infusion the fear went down for the first time in a month he started having less oxygen requirement and was discharged like three days into the the after the infusion um so yeah i think that the indication should be broadened and we should consider other settings in which we can use these these uh monoclonals because they're actually very consistent this 80 percent 85 percent um ability to prevent severe disease it's been constant in both the eli lily and the and the regenerator and there's another one coming from jsk and dir which is another monoclonal that i think is requesting in ua so we're going to have at least three maybe four monoclonals to use in different uh type of patients so i i totally agree thanks john for the for that thought-provoking question i hope your patient is doing doing okay right now thanks nestor um david tempest um do you want to unmute and ask your question about the met uh the mode of administration the sub q versus the infusion if not um my connection is uh that's okay yeah is this unstable yeah no problem let me let me yeah yeah i'll read it for you thank you um so nestor um david's question is that um that given that the previous monoclonal antibodies have been infusions based on adding kind of significant antibodies uh what what do you what do you think the mechanism of the subq injection is that's a great question i i don't know i i don't know i mean the how you can use i mean how can you why you need to use an ib and then you can use a sub q i really don't know i remember like for instance um and this is going way back uh when we used uh ige ibig for prevention of hepatitis b in the in the good old times when we use like ibie or people who who were gonna travel to places where there was some diminishing of some diseases we were given like a subcutaneous ingestion of immunoglobulin so i guess it's the same same principle you don't need to use ib you can use a sub-q but honestly i don't know the difference uh the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the this antibody injection subcutaneous as opposed to intravenous but it's definitely very convenient i mean i can almost think of a treatment in a pharmacy um you know if you if you develop kobe you call your you have your opposite you call your doctor the doctor can call the pers so the injection in the pharmacy and you can get it in your in your pharmacy right away the same day you don't have to go to an emergency room and and get an iv set up et cetera so i think it's very very useful uh if we use it you know rapidly and an efficient efficient way absolutely what what this makes me think of is you know i primarily see patients with headaches and there's now three fda approved you know preventive medications for migraines that are all immune biological agents that are all monthly subcutaneous injections just like this and one of them the one of the four is an um intravenous um preparation so somehow it's working just fine as a subject subcutaneous preparations so maybe i'll look i'll look into that and bring that back next week um deborah mcgrew do you want to i'm not exactly sure um what your question is do you want to unmute and ask your question about the if patients need to be maybe screened uh better before their j j vaccine yes thank you um yeah i didn't quite mean that i meant um in that study who said that people did not have coagulation history of coagulation disorders and so i wondered was that just their history or were they actually screened for um coagulation disorders after they developed a thrombotic event that's a good question i think it was basically on the history because this is the information uh gathered from the vaccine adverse event reports so i guess the medical history of those patients before they had this traumatic event was negative but i i mean some of them were still hospitalized with trombocitopenia so i doubt they were able to do like uh much studies at that point i think it was more the history they're probably asking have you had have you ever had a dbt or a pe no that that was it that was probably it or not no uh genetic coalition disorder like hemophilia or something so they probably said no but it was probably just historical i i'd be surprised if they they have some pre uh event or post event data at this point well i would wonder i mean i know some adults who've you know had their first event in their 50s or you know and had a had a kind of quiescent clotting disorder anyway thank you nestor there's some more questions including one run from myself um about the j j uh vaccine one is from sandra murdoch saying do you know the woman who had the cavernous sinus thrombosis were on birth control pills um i also wanted to know if the patients who recovered and left the hospital if they had kind of lasting neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsies um and then um and then there's another question from yomi tadper have you heard of other cloud events with the mrna vaccines so those kind of three questions right no i don't know the answer to the first part i mean i haven't i i haven't seen them if they were or not using birth control pills obviously um estrogen in general are a predisposing factor but i didn't see a report of the use of australians in these patients and again i think it has to do with the fact that and that's one of some of the things that i think they're looking into with the astra seneca and with the jnj vaccine um but i don't i don't think i saw any any information on the on the medication that they were using uh honestly and and i think what i saw about mrnas and thrombotic events um it seems to be really rare i mean they have given almost 200 million doses and they have not reported this type of events obviously there are people who normally are going to develop dvts and pes and i even remember i think in the in the studies but not that i know uh cabernet synonymous thrombosis or splenic splatnic vein thrombosis i haven't seen that in in almost 200 vaccinies uh according to what the cdc mentioned so so if if if it occurs it's really extremely rare more rare than than what we're seeing with the astra seneca and the jnj great uh thank you nestor um back to you carla thank you joanna um there there's just one more question about before we leave that the jnj vaccine so since there is at risk since there is that risk for possible blood clots with the j j vaccine would it be reasonable to counsel patients and consider changing to progesterone only birth control yeah i don't know i honestly don't know that answer good thought i don't know the other question that it's a natural question is should we if we vaccinate with j and j a young female should she take aspirin or something i don't think so but that's thoughts that are coming into people's mind like can you do something to prevent it i mean it's so rare that one in a million you have to to use a lot of antiquivalence uh to prevent one case but it's something that that colleagues have asked me i mean if i give this to my sister she should be taking aspirin you know i don't know she just stopped the birth control pill for for a month we don't really know i mean we have i think we need to to see more data to answer the question that you are asking i mean where all of these uh patients on on birth control or not if they were not then that doesn't make sense to to do a change in that um and also understand the the phenomenon you know what's causing the because maybe something that is correctable if it's something like a contaminant or or or something that is in the vaccine maybe they can they can eliminate that or or try to diminish the the that ingredient and and prevent that from occurring but we don't know yet what's causing this if this is the vector or or or something else yeah thank you uh really complex issue um there's a question there's actually a couple of comments and a question from bruce tempest about um nestor i'm not sure if you read that the editorial in the in the albuquerque journal last week about herd immunity in new mexico um if you did not did you no i did not i did not i'm sorry i don't know carissa did you read it so actually i was taking a look at it during um this call since there were a couple questions that came up i think the the overall conclusion of the article um you know was is that herd immunity is a journey and that there's a percentages at which we um begin that journey um i think that the data around when herd immunity is actually achieved um are quite clear and so so i think the the author was speaking to um the beginning of the journey of herd immunity um we are certainly not there because we still continue to see cases um persist and you know we're not quite at a point where we're seeing consistently declining cases i think we're seeing a leveling of the number of cases but that that does not indicate herd immunity because we should start to see fewer and fewer cases every week rather than a pretty flat number and we still get some spikes um and and we're still um still have quite a few restrictions um that are happening on capacity and gatherings and we're continuing to wear masks and do social distancing um so we have a lot of mitigation efforts that are helping to contain the infection so all of those things together i think it lets us know that we are with the vaccination efforts that we've been doing the department of health has been rolling them out very well in new mexico i don't think that we've yet achieved herd immunity but we are definitely on well on our way but all of the mitigation efforts still need to stay in place as we get there thank you thank you carissa um there's a couple of questions esther about your physical activity um paper that you were talking about uh fred fox said the relationship of activity and severity of illness is a correlation and not a not necessarily a cause the inactive individuals likely had more comorbidities was any attempt made to eliminate confounding variables yes they did yeah yes that's a great question obviously there is obviously some relationship in that but yeah they did they did that just for like underlying condition diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease in that study but i agree this is a retrospective review of charts so it's not a prospective double blind placebo control i mean they didn't put people to exercise and not exercise and then they saw if they die morocco it is a retrospective review and we have learned we have learned painfully during this pandemic that retrospective reviews have a lot of limitations so the logical the next logical thing that is not going to occur is to actually uh you know take a sample of people and and ask them to do regular exercise and then uh you know and and placebo group normally normal activity and then see if they're actually uh there is a difference but this is sort of a hint of an association or correlation as was mentioned yeah this is not a proof of cost in any way but they did they did try to correct from confounders obviously because that's the obvious thing obesity hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes are are clear confounders and and in general people with obesity diabetes hypertension uh for many reasons are not necessarily the most active uh uh so so it's a logical thing to think but but they did they corrected for that but i but there's that caveat that this is a retrospective chart review with all the limitations of that type of design thank you very much um there's a multi-part question about the variants from sylvia metzger i'm going to ask all of it and see if let's see how effective do the current vaccines appear to be against covet variants that's the first part of the question and which variants are we most concerned about and the last question is how widely or implemented is genomic testing right now to sort of see what what variants we're potentially working with here looking at here in new mexico right okay so yeah so first of all i think in general the efficacy of the vaccines against severe disease with with almost all of the variants is very good i mean we have seen even even um even the the johnson and johnson maxine the astra seneca and obviously the mrna vaccine are very good at protecting against severe disease and hospitalization across all variants so far so i think and there are people who are actually calling eric topple from the scripps institute is calling the variants escarians because we we are really scared about these variants but but a lot of the data doesn't support that they are really you know that either deadly or or unable to be inhibited by the protection given by the by the vaccine so i think across the board if you look at severe disease uh almost all vaccine seems to protect against severe disease with with all all of the variants if you look if you if you take a step backward and you just look at the neutralizing antibodies there are some difference obviously i have shown slides to that regard um especially the the south african and the brazilian variant tend to the antibodies that you have after vaccination are not as as high the neutralizing antibodies are not as high against those variants so there's sort of a drop in the in the potency of the neutralizing antibodies but that but that doesn't mean that clinically is going to translate into more severe diseases and in fact we haven't seen that and there's so the other side of the coin is the t cell immunity and i actually was reviewing some uh some papers yesterday about how robust the the immune response the cellular immune response to the variants are the spike protein has more than 20 to 30 epitopes so areas in which the t cells recognize the protein as foreign and modifying one or two with this variant is not going to nullify the the t cell response so there's also that sort of backup of the immune system of the t cell that is also giving protections against the virus so so yeah so i think um all of the vaccines seems to be really good preventing disease maybe symptomatic disease against the south african some of the vaccines are affected but definitely they're they're really good at preventing and definitely we have shown with the uk wagon which is the one in the us um we have seen that is very effective they have been able to flatten the curve both in the uk and in in israel where they have a high percentage of circulation of this variant so at least uh for what we worried right now that the v117 seems to be completely susceptible to even the astra seneca vaccine in the uk and obviously to the mrna and other vaccines here in the u.s regarding new mexico i think i showed data last week um that there are there there is a group both at the at the the lab at the national lab here and at the at unm um collaborating with all the the laboratories looking for the for for the genetics of the virus circulating in the community and there's actually this very nice collaboration and new mexico is one of the top in the country regarding the percentages of of of samples that are being sequenced so we are right there i think number five number seven in the country in percentage of cases that have been um sequence so we're really you know monitoring these uh both the department of health unm the private labs like tricor and others are actually collaborating and sending sending uh samples so so we are looking into the into the different variants and as i mentioned last week um we have here the california variance of concern of uh the 427 and 429 and we have also the the uk variant those are like the three top uh circulating they're very you know few cases of the south african or p1 uh in in our area it's mostly the california variants and and obviously the increasing like in the rest of the country of the b117 or the uk variant i think i answered the the two most concerning are p1 and and and 351 which is uh the uk and the i'm sorry the the south african and the brazilian are the the more concerning variants because of the impact on neutralizing antibodies but with all the caveats that i mentioned thank you thank you for that um i want to just let everybody know that the cme link just went into the chat so if you would like see me please fill that out and we would love to get your feedback about the office hours um one more question from me nestor uh melvina mccabe bam bamlan ivab eua was revoked by the fda is this is this correct do you know about that mister yeah i don't know if it's revoked or they actually uh recommended that it's not used alone so that it's always used with the ssl map and it has to do with the efficacy against some of these variants that we were talking that apparently bangladesh loses the efficacy against some of the variants circulating in the u.s so it didn't make sense to keep using it as a monotherapy because when you see the patient for the first time you don't know if he has a variant of concern or an old or an old variant that is susceptible to the bam bomb dynamic map so the recommendation was that everybody should give the combination therapy which is band anemium and at the same map or regeneron which is already a combination of two monoclonals but not van linimium alone but yeah i think they're not using or they're not recommending monotherapy anymore because of that because you you can have you know 20 30 40 of your of your patients with uh with a variant that is resistant to the body map so so it's like a gamble to use it and and and it may not be effective so that that's what i know about the the new recommendation that you have to use a butter in combination with eta cetera thank you nestor um somebody asked about this email like it went in at a 12 47 if you go go back in the chat you can find it and with that i'm going to turn it back up over to joanna thanks thanks so much carla um martha d'ambrosio asked a question about uh jama about the journal jama discussing thrombocytopenia also with mrna vaccines and the pl4 antibody also and wanted it she wanted to get your tate take on that nester um yeah i haven't i haven't seen that article i mean i really looked into that and and i actually um you know read part of the the the or was listening to part of the meeting with the with the the vaccine at cdc and i i i mean i haven't heard anything about specifically about thrombosis and trauma side opinion there are cases of thrombocytopenia um associated with with um with mrna vaccine but it's it's basically uh the normal you know occurrence of thrombocytopenia itp and others that occur when you vaccinate you know a lot of people you're gonna have people with purpura basically um in your population but it's not i haven't seen that phenomenon or the thrombosis and trombocytopenia caused by or associated directly with an mrna vaccine that's what i meant but obviously there are there are patients with trouble cytopenia and there are patients with thrombosis there are patients who who were vaccinated and developed dbt or pe for other reasons but but not related um at least no culturally related to the vaccine right thanks nestor and then adella whole green uh kind of said are our patients with thrombocytopenia good candidates for any kind of copic uh 19 uh vaccine so a lot of questions about thrombocytopenia um and then jerry uh wilms kind of mentions what you said about the fact that there might be under reporting of kind of venous thrombosis and dbt and other kinds of uh issues especially with elderly or kind of patients with kind of comorbidities because it's kind of harder to tease out so thank you for that um and uh fred fox is is happy that you're getting exercise [Laughter] um and then uh harry do you want to unmute um and ask about the the b117 um yeah hi good morning um i had read perhaps a week or two weeks ago that the b117 variant was becoming the dominant strain across the u.s is that still current thinking or is that just regionalized in parts of california and parts of the west i was wondering what you thought nestor yeah yes good question thank you yeah the i i saw the data from the cdc and they actually if you look in this if you look in the cc webpage they have a nice color graph i don't have it off hand but uh in which they they show the different percentage and i think recently b117 became the predominant in the us as a whole it i think it was 27 if i remember correctly it was around 27 of all of all uh variants of concern or all variants was the b117 and then there was a whole array of others in new mexico is i the latest data that i saw um it was not that high not 27 it was below that and we have a mix of b117 and the two california uh variants as the more prevalent in new mexico which is logical because we're really you know close to to arizona and california but that that's what i saw um and actually what do kowalenski uh in the press like a couple weeks ago actually announced that officially the b117 was the more common or the most common variant in the u.s at this point but it's still around 30 percent uh you know national in in the national uh frequency not not higher than that yet nestor can i this is joanna i'm gonna just uh ask you a couple questions about that i my understanding is that it was first my remembering from the media and from studies is that it really kind of first got noticed entering the kind of u.s population that are in around kind of december or january so that really like in three four months it really has taken over as the number one uh strain is that is that right yeah that is correct exactly and in fact in the uk it was noticed in september and it became you know uh the most frequent in december so it was also very rapidly uh substituting the other the other invariants so from from like september to december went from like very small percentage to 90 of the of the strange especially in east london and some other areas in the uk it really uh you know became really prevalent right and so when companies like pfizer and modern are talking about perhaps a booster uh or a third shot for many americans you know this year are are they gonna you know think about the same uh the same kind of material or are they going to think about you know something more robust against kind of this strain or what is your thought on that that's a good question i think it's it's hard to predict my fear is that because this this problem changes so rapidly that if they start making one for b1 one seven maybe b117 will not be of an issue six months down the road when they when they do the studies and start using it so it's kind of uh difficult but yeah i have heard this conversation about booster already i i heard peter hotel is talking about a booster after six months uh the pfizer ceo mentioning also that the need for a booster in in a few in a few a month it's possible i mean we do it with influenza every year so it wouldn't be the first time that we need to do like you know sequential boostering and it makes sense if one of these variants in which the neutralizing antibody really goes down like the uk or i'm sorry the south africa or the brazilian become prevalent uh it would probably make sense to to give better protection to do a new uh vaccine more specific for that for those variants but i think this is something that is so fluid that is very hard to predict and there's also there are people experts who actually believe that the immune protection of the t cell immunity what i was mentioning before prevents severe disease and apparently none of the variants affect cell immunity because the t cells react to many epitopes so they actually recognize different areas 23 30 something depending if it's cd4 or cda they actually recognize a lot of areas in the spike protein so a change in one or two or three it's not going to nullify the effect against all of the other epitopes in the in the spike protein so so you know if being optimistic maybe we're not going to need a booster so soon we're going to be nervous because the neutralizing antibodies go down but probably the severe disease protection will last a little bit longer than six months and and that's we're going to have to actually accrue that information when we keep monitoring the epidemic we will see that that nobody's dying of cobit hopefully or no severe uh patients no hospitalization would cover despite having been vaccinated six or nine or ten months uh before so if we see that there may not be a need for a for a booster at six months maybe a year or maybe longer because you're gonna have this protection against the video this is lasting longer that's what i i'm trying to interpret from what i'm reading especially regarding the t-cell immunity that seems to be more diverse and more long-lasting than the that the b cell and the neutralizing antibodies that seem to after six months start like falling in the curves that i've seen okay super helpful uh really helpful um one qu one question i've heard that india i don't know if you've heard any i know that india has kind of also taken a downward uh course and and is doing quite poorly well related to covet and i've heard that they're having trouble with even a couple of their different variants on their spike protein can you comment any that you know anything about that nester i've just heard the news i mean the headlines that is going up i know that there's a lot of a lot of the population is very large in india they haven't really achieved vaccination of a large percentage of the population and interestingly you know the same phenomenon is occurring in europe believe it or not europe vaccination percentages except for the uk which is sort of an outlier the rest of the european countries are going through lockdowns uh uh you know the fourth wave or the third wave whatever of kobe despite having the vaccines and i think it has to do with the fact that uh here in the u.s the mrna vaccines were acquired really early and they were used and we have been vaccinating people since december in europe they're they're countries that are less than 10 to 20 of the population have received the first dose um and and they're using they were using astrazeneca or planning to use johnson and johnson and now they are stuck with the with this complication so it's been really complicated in india and the same phenomenon occurs in south america like chile and brazil are having a significant number of cases i'm in contact with some of my colleagues in chile and brazil and they're going through through hell literally they have no oxygen no beds no it's really a horrible situation in latin america despite the fact that they're starting to vaccinate their people and chile is actually pretty much advanced but they still having a lot of cases it's it's hard thank you nestor so much i think we're pretty much out of time wanted to thank nestor you so much thanks uh carissa um thank you cecilia thanks carla had to leave a couple of minutes early but i want to thank carla thornton um and want to thank all of all of you so much for coming online we've got our first responder resiliency echo in one hour at two o'clock uh dr jason christensen from the department of psychiatry is going to be speaking today on uh resiliency and primary care and we have our chronic pain and substance use echo on thursday at noon thank you so much again for great participation and we look forward to seeing you next week take care,,4/19/2021
46,hi everybody can you hear me great welcome to our april 26 office hours i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm and uh it's great to see everybody on video and if you have a webcam and you'd like to turn that on that would be great for many of you it's your lunch hour and it's perfectly fine to eat and drink while you're on video and with us today i'd like to introduce my colleague briefly dr carla thornton hi good morning good afternoon everyone carla thornton infectious diseases physician and associate director here at project echo thank you thank you carla um hope everyone is doing well and staying safe like to introduce nestor sosa our leader here he's the division chief of infectious disease at unm school of medicine um nestor i think we'll begin with you with our uh your presentation thank you nestor thank you joanna and carla and thank you for for always being such good moderators i think i have never thank you before but and and and to all the participants for being here uh week in and week out every single week so let me let me just try to share my screen and go directly to the to the update all right good so we'll we'll i have several papers to share but first of all i want to just share with everybody the the fact that the johnson and johnson pause was lifted so people will be able to vaccinate and this is the language the cdc and the fda posted in the webpage in case you haven't seen it they said use of the jansen kobe 19 vaccine should be resumed in the united states fda and cdc have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing preventing kobe and the fda has determined that the available data showed that the vaccine known and potential benefits awaits the risk basically in 18 years of older so so they they did not put any any restrictions like they didn't limit it to only males or over 50 like in other countries they actually um open it where to everybody over the age of of 18 years i sort of heard the press conference that dr wolinski the cdc director and other dignitary from fda did that day and i i was able to to get some some of the information and also available in the web page so first of all they added um a few cases so that we have so far a total of 15 cases of this thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome associated with the vaccine before if you remember i presented the data on six cases so it's a total of 15 and that's what they were waiting for they were basically analyzing those who had recently been vaccinated to make sure and they found that in fact all of these cases occur in women so no cases in mail and um 18 to 59 so they brought them a little bit it was 18 to 49 if you remember so there was a couple of cases in older than 50 and then the same the same issue presentation between 6 and 15 days after vaccination that was sort of the summary of the update of of the new cases and they they actually did a risk benefit analysis and they and they said well the incidence of this event in 18 to 49 is seven cases per million uh and for women over 50 only 0.9 cases per million and they compare that with the risk of copied and death and copic hospitalization in the same age group so if you're 18 and 49 and you're vaccinated you can avert 650 hospitalization per million and 12 deaths per million and if you're over 50 4 700 hospitalizations are prevented and 600 deaths are prevented so when they look at these numbers and this number they say well the benefits definitely await the risks um and that's how they reach that that conclusion to open the vaccination again with jnj the second topic that i want to uh to go over and i apologize this is a very sort of complicated paper so um you have to be i actually read it like two two times and and spend a lot of time with the with the graph so i'm going to try to go over um it was analyzing um using the the va database they actually publish um what they call a high dimensional characterization of the pos acute sequelae of kobe 19 and the way they did it the this investigator i think they were from the university of washington um they actually took um 73 000 veterans who had kobe during the the pandemic in the u.s and they compared with 4.9 almost 5 million veterans who did not have copied this is like the powerful database that the ba veterans health administration has available and and they selected patients who had survived beyond 30 days um and that were not hospitalized so these are these are essentially patients and controls um that were not hospitalized during this period that just and and for the covet patient patients who are calling assault patients over managed and as an outpatient and they look at what happened to them after after they had copied and the main sort of the headline of the paper is that even if you had copied but you didn't go into the hospital you have a hustle ratio of death of 1.59 meaning 60 more risk of death or 59 higher risk of death um if you had coffee that if you did not and they compare this to the regular ba patients with other diseases and in fact there was an excess death uh in this group of of copied survivors of eight death per a thousand patients during the six months of follow-up so definitely uh copied even if if you didn't die of kobe during the hospital during the your initial infection it impairs in somehow your your health and then they they went ahead and analyzed the excess of diagnosis new diagnosis or incident diagnosis the excess use of medication by these sub copy survivors and even the abnormalities in the lab and and i i don't expect you to read this this graph just to have have an idea um these were the number of diagnoses that were sort of new or added and they were in excess um compared with the cohort that didn't have covet so obviously respiratory symptom 28 per thousand excess diagnosis hypertension and you can go down the list basically all systems were affected by this post copied uh disease or postcode syndrome if you want to call it so there was a lot of new diagnosis on this patient after they had copied in the va system and if you look at medication use there was also an excess use of medication and you can see these are all the all the numbers are excess uh consults or excess prescriptions for per thousand uh subjects compared to the controls so basically bronchodilators analgesic anticoagulants non-steroidal etc were used by by these by these 73 000 patients and even laboratory abnormalities was much more common in uh in covet patients things like low hemoglobin increasing a1c that we have seen in association with diabetes decompensation etc so a lot of a lot of medication new diagnosis and laboratory abnormalities in this cohort of 73 000 veterans who had copied versus those who did not who were just users of the of the system and these were again non-hospitalized copy patients so amazingly an amazing use of healthcare resources by this population at the va uh and then this i i don't expect you to understand this graph it took me like 30 minutes i'm still not sure i understand it but they basically try to put the whole thing in a graph and and they said on the outside are the hassel ratio um of the of the postcobit syndrome and those in yellow are those hazel ratio which are over one so there were a lot of diagnosis that were more common in the in the in the postcode syndrome in these different organ systems ear endocrine circulatory and you can see the darker color in the in this inner ring means the the excess burning of the seeds among the kobe patients and finally the peas uh those who are statistically significant they graph the p the negative log value of the b so the longer the bar the more zeros have the p so more significant the difference between the past patients and and the control patients so uh you know it's a interesting way to present the data but what this means basically is that the the the disease um burden and and um and and uh use of of the healthcare was significantly higher among those who were considered copied survivors and than the controls and the fact another aspect of this this paper they tried to they also look at patients who were hospitalized in orange in icu so there was sort of a a broader a cohort of patients and they they compare the chances of having uh postcode syndrome and the severity and there's there was obviously a correlation that has a ratio of having postcode syndrome was higher in all the categories in those who were in the icu followed by those who were hospitalized and and even those who were not hospitalized obviously had more events than than the control groups so although although obviously icu and an hospitalized patient had a lot of issues post post code even those who were not hospitalized had had more events than those who had another another diagnosis and there was obviously this correlation between copied severity and task severality in these in this analysis okay so much for post calling so the conclusion just to summarize 60 increased risk of death after copied without hospitalization a broad array of incident pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations increased risk of incident use of several medications especially opioids antidepressant etc and finally a correlation between severity of the disease of the acute covet and the postcode sequelae there was also a publication on the use of mrna vaccines and i think we reviewed this in the pre-publication but now we made it to the to the new england journals so they the the these authors uh from from the cdc actually published the data on almost uh almost 36 000 pregnant um subjects who receive either moderna or phaser vaccine here in the united states and you can see the distribution by age most of them were pregnant when they were vaccinated 85 0.8 and 87.4 were already vaccinated and some of them became pregnant um shortly after after vaccination and the important uh finding on one side is that adverse event the reactorgenicity was not worse in fact the light blue are the pregnant and you can see that most of the bars are higher in the non-pregnant than in the pregnant female except for pain so pain in the side of injection was slightly more frequent in pregnancy but then the rest of the symptoms systemic fatigue headache et cetera were less common in pregnant subjects so so that was sort of reassuring and the other probably most important finding are the frequency of pregnancy loss and neonatal outcomes in these in these subjects and this is from the be safe pregnancy registry you can see that the percentage here in parentheses of these events spontaneous abortions still birth preterm small size for gestational a success etc are very similar to what is reported in the literature and they all give this the the published incidents of these events uh versus what happened in this group and there was basically no safety signal and that was the main conclusion of the of this paper in these uh 35 000 um subjects that were analyzed uh in in the modern and physical vaccine registry here in the us uh something that we have been uh listening to are the vaccine through infection real vaccine breakthrough infections and in fact there was a report um in the new england journal of two cases and this is interesting because they they just reported and this this made it to the to the new england but took two well documented cases one was a 51 year old female that developed kobe symptomatic coping 19 days after the second dose so she was fully vaccinated with a moderna and another case of a 65 year old that developed symptomatic kovid 36 days after the second dose of of the physical vaccine and and the interesting uh aspect of this paper is that they actually did a full genome uh sequencing of of the patient number one hold on a second let me mute my cell that is taking my concentration so so let's see what what they found first of all the patient um number one they have they they were able to obtain antibodies early in the disease in the in this symptomatic coping and and she had very very very high levels of neutralizing antibodies and they're comparing here neutralizing antibodies of those vaccinated uh the population those who have not natural disease and you can see clearly that this patient was sort of on the high side of of of the levels of antibodies so it was not that she didn't amount an immune response she had an immune response but nevertheless developed symptomatic covet and that's one of the findings of the study that even if you have appropriate antibodies you can develop um kobe despite being adequately vaccinated and then when they look at the mutation they did find several uh significant mutations they found the e484 which is one that have been associated with immune scape and and many others you can see this one detected detected so they they they actually map out all the all the mutations that she had so she did have sort of a special a variant a different virus from the from the the original wild type virus and actually when they tried to put it in that this is a phylogenetic tree with all the clades uh and the variants they tried to place they couldn't really place this patient in any in any clay she was between the uk variant and the new york by varian which is called 526 so it was sort of a recombinant event but she definitely had a new uh or at least none not easily classifiable virus and that's probably what she presented escape or the immune scape in her case so conclusion a well-documented cases of breakthrough symptomatic infections and two fully vaccinated subjects one of them with a very high antibody level interestingly enough the infection occur with patients with this significant mutation and finally it also opens the possibility of recombination so this patient had um sort of an in-between uh strain that was that has some similarity to the uk the v117 and also some mutation of the five to six so they're they're postulating that maybe there was a recombination and she was infected with a recombinant virus so interesting i think they need to elaborate more on this but it was a lot of interesting and this article actually um made me look for the for the cdc data on breakthrough infections and this is what has been reported and it's in the in the i i think i checked it saturday afternoon in the webpage so 7157 breakthrough infections and these are infection after two after 14 days after the second dose of the vaccines among 87 million people this is the number of of patients that have were fully vaccinated when they did this analysis and you can see that you know some of these infections were severe 498 were hospitalized and actually 88 dies so so although the vaccine is extremely protective it's not obviously a hundred percent and some of these patients were hospitalized for other reasons and some of the fatal cases were also for other reasons not related to cobalt but nevertheless there was some death and some hospitalization directly linked to kobe the good thing is that if you divide 7157 by 87 87 million you get this percentage so actually the percentage of getting copied after vaccination it's pretty low it's it's less than i mean you're protected 99.999 uh two percent so very high degree of protection um but nevertheless there were some cases obviously i'm on 87 so i thought it was interesting and finally two quick quick i'm almost done two quick articles i'm sorry uh so this this is one question i'm 20 years old i'm a college student healthy i had copied a few months ago can i get it again well the marines did a study very interesting they they had uh new marines recruit around 3 000 most of them male 18 to 28 and before they were they started their training they actually did um a pretty comprehensive uh study to make sure that they didn't have coffee or they had copied and they found 189 89 of those recruits had already had copied in the past and we're talking 18 to 20 year old healthy mostly males and then they follow them every couple of weeks they did a pcr in a week 2 4 and 16 during their their uh training and they actually had an outbreak they had an outbreak in this group of marines despite all the precautions they had an outbreak and in fact what they found is that out of the 189 cerro positive those who had kobe before 10 became reinfected so 10 uh um out of these 189 sero-positive which give you an incidence of 1.1 case per person year but the outbreak was huge among the cellular negative they found 48 so half of the cellular negative became infected in this in this significant outbreak among the marines recruits so you can you can say i mean it was five times less the risk of of of being infected it was several positive but it was not zero it was actually ten percent incident so very very interesting well well conducted epidemiological study demonstrating that yeah you're protected if you have coffee but you're not a hundred percent protected it's more like eighty to ninety percent uh protection of from natural infection that's another reason to get the vaccine to try to improve the antibody levels and finally there was a small letter in the jama internal medicine you know that cec recommended a few weeks ago the use of double math so these researchers actually had a device that measured the particles on people on volunteers with one or two masks and they actually analyzed procedure masks different brands of procedure mask single mass double mask and you can see the level of filtration they use a uh calculation called fitted filtration efficiency which basically counts the number of particles behind the mask so this is evaluating how much protects you know how you protect others with the mass how you protect it when you use single a double mask and there was an increase obviously of the protection if you were two procedures or one on top of the other and probably more practical and more real they also analyze cloth mask either using the procedure map over or under the cloth or the bandana or a polyester gator and and they basically found that in all cases the protection incl increased significantly um from the just the the polyester or the of the cotton with the procedure uh below one goes from six from 44 for instance to 66 and here for 41 to 81 so sort of demonstrating that in fact um using a procedure mask underneath a cloth mask increases the the protection significance so so um this goes along with what the cdc recommended and i thought it was interesting to see this at least in the in an experiment or a real life and they use usually um they use uh volunteers they use a female volunteer and two male volunteers uh to measure these uh these values all right thank you that's it i took a little bit longer but it was a couple of good things excellent thank you nestor uh so much uh really appreciate it as always um wanted to introduce uh dr leslie hayes from espanola our primary care and addiction physician dr hayes hi leslie hayes hang on just a second and i was really happy to hear nestor say that it took him a little while to understand his study because one of the studies i'm doing today i found very confusing um and uh but it was so interesting i did want to cover it so um i'm only going to cover two the first is um just one that was really big in the news this week and so i wanted to actually look at the study and it was on covet transmission and it was actually a study by um i don't know if they were physicists or mathematicians but um they were looking basically at air transmission in inside and how um aerosols would be transmission large droplet and the six foot rule obviously matters with large droplet contact and airborne so their paper was looking at airborne when you've got the tiny little droplets circulating how much um is that going to affect transmission indoors so they're thinking and they just set a good percentage and i don't actually know what percentage we really think is airborne versus droplet um i know that we're thinking contact is probably pretty low and so what they did is they looked at a theoretical model of airborne transmission if somebody coughed or breathed in a room what are going to happen to those small aerosol droplets in the room and where are they going to go and so they were talking about when people cough sneeze sing breathe they expel an array of liquid droplets some of these are big some of these are small and these can represent a substantial vector of disease transmission and so i thought this was kind of interesting they look at the different levels of virus produced depending on what you do and singing is clearly by far and away the most i am not going to be in a room with somebody singing until this pandemic is over um loud speech is also um fairly significant and all i could think of was the number of people who i'm in a store and they see a friend and they pull off their mask and hey jim but they're gonna spew a lot more viral particles and speech that's sort of intermediate or whispered will produce less and then just breathing will produce some and depending on how hard your breathing so and then they used a lot of math and this is actually not all of their variables i just wanted to show you how many variables they had and i like math a lot i could not follow their um equations they just it was too complicated but using all of this math that they did that i'm just going to have to trust is correct because like i said it was beyond my um skills what they found is if you are in an indoor space the droplet particles are evenly dispersed throughout any indoor space so it doesn't matter if um i'm talking the airborne uh the aerosols um it doesn't matter where you are in the room if you're 60 feet away from somebody it it's still going to be dispersed so evenly that you're going to be just as exposed if you were six feet away from them and so what they actually found using this was that the most important variables for transmission were cumulative exposure time and whether or not people are wearing a mask and also the kind of ventilation you had for the room so this is kind of an interesting thing i want to go over in a little bit of detail so um what they the red line is um where it becomes unsafe to be how long it takes to become unsafe if you have somebody come into the room and all the way over to the left you have the occupancy limit so we're going to look at 20 people if you have 20 people in the room and they you have natural ventilation somebody comes in if you're wearing a mask i want you to notice especially the time in masks and days the time without masks in hours to give you a difference of how much the mask makes a difference so you have somebody come into the room with covid not wearing a mask and natural ventilation it's going to take about an hour before somebody else in the room become is likely to become infected if you only have 10 people in it's going to take maybe two hours but not a huge amount of difference if you have mechanical ventilation and air filtration system it's probably going to take close to seven hours now if you have masks on and mechanical ventilation somebody comes in even if you have 20 people in the room it's probably going to take three and a half days before somebody is going to get in infected so so there's the three important variables whether or not they're wearing a mask how many people are in the room and the kind of ventilation you have and it really doesn't matter in the room that people are sitting six feet apart or 60 feet apart if you've got these aerosols because it's going to be spread throughout so evenly now in the nursing home you'll notice you get far less time and that's partly because they had a much lower risk um ratio for the nursing home they were far less willing to accept um somebody being exposed so with natural ventilation it's very very little time that people end up becoming an unsafe risk of infection and even with air filters it only goes up to about 24 hours so um very important to wear masks and it did convince me of the value of the mechanical ventilation or the filters so take home messages wear your mask limit your cumulative indoor time especially if there's a lot of other people around don't count on staying more than six feet apart to protect you good ventilation of indoor spaces is essential and don't sing indoors and the second study was so much easier to understand i like medical studies so much better um so this was an outbreak in a nursing home in kentucky and they had vaccinated the majority of their um uh workers and the majority of the residents um and there was an um when kovac came into the facility uh the um and it was a newly introduced variant to the region what they found was unvaccinated residents had three times greater risk of getting copied and unvaccinated healthcare personnel had a 4.1 times greater risk of infection as the vaccinated residents and healthcare providers did so the vaccine was 86.5 percent protective against symptomatic illnesses among residents and 87 protective among health care providers and so the sniff had done vaccine clinics january 10 january 31st and february 21st um there were 83 residents and 116 healthcare personnel and 90 percent of the residents got the vaccine and 52 of the healthcare personnel got the vaccine i was kind of horrified it was only 50 but i guess they said that's actually way better than the national for nursing homes which is at 37 and they had um routine um healthcare personnel antigen testing and uh eight days after the third vaccination clinic and this just made me want to weep the index case was an unvaccinated symptomatic healthcare provider or personnel who had come into the facility once the outbreak was identified they started doing daily point-of-care antigen testing of all residents and twice weekly healthcare personnel testing and they had 46 coveted 19 cases were identified there were cases in 26 residents 18 of whom were fully vaccinated and 20 health care providers of whom four were vaccinated um two cases occurred in residents who had gotten their second vaccine within 14 days so they didn't include them in the final analysis and so again they found the vaccinated residents and healthcare personnel were less likely to be infected than an native person the attack rate in unvaccinated residence was 75 whereas in vaccinated residents it was 25 unvaccinated healthcare personnel were four times as likely um to get it and unvaccinated healthcare personnel was 29.64 um chance of getting it and then vaccinated healthcare personnel was seven percent and the vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 66 among residents and 75.9 uh percent among the um healthcare personnel and if any of your um uh colleagues who are healthcare workers are still hesitant on getting the vaccine i would point out this study um this one person who came in was responsible for 46 coveted cases including three deaths so and that's all i had thank you dr hayes that was fantastic i would really appreciate it and want to move on to marla sivers i think marla does not have a presentation but i'd like to introduce marla sivers our new mexico department of health epidemiologist marla hi good afternoon everyone um i don't have a slides or a formal update today but just wanted to share that new mexico will be resuming the j j vaccine distribution this week following the recommendation from cdc and fda and asip and um there is a clinician call being hosted by uh cdc tomorrow i'll put the link in the chat that um one of the uh chair people from the asic committee um is going to be on reviewing uh the evidence and the updated vaccine recommendations so i think it will be very helpful uh maybe for clinicians uh to review that evidence um i saw a preview of it on saturday at an idsa call and it's very good in terms of understanding everything that they looked at the astrazeneca data that they looked at and how they came to their conclusion basically using a population health lens which they acknowledged as you know a little different than looking at a risk benefit for individual patients so it was just helpful to hear their reasoning and walk through that and may be helpful for people as you have questions from your patients about which vaccine they should choose if they have a choice uh thank you marla so much really appreciate that um i want to introduce carissa culbreth the medical director for tricord lab carissa hi sorry it took me a minute to get off of mute hello everyone good to see you all today next week i'm going to provide an update on some of the other respiratory viruses that are beginning to circulate now that people are a little bit more out and about and to show everyone in the new mexico area where they can access that information from the tri-core website so i'll be providing that update next week thank you so much dr cobra um and now i'm going to turn it over to dr thornton for questions and answers thank you everybody thanks joanna um i'm going to go sort of back up to the beginning that's from some of the studies that you presented and i don't know sarah do you want to enter uh and meet yourself and introduce yourself and just ask your question hi sarah go ahead i got it sorry for some reason it wouldn't unmute um so my question nestor is uh my my daughter who's at the university of washington has a roommate who got the modern vaccine and apparently had a clot each time and i forgotten one of them was they were in her extremities they were not like splank headache um now i don't know anything about how this was diagnosed but that's that was the party line so i guess my question is is um other vaccine um other vaccines besides j and j have been associated with clots um have they yeah the great question yeah i think that there have been reports of of of dbt and pe but not with thrombocytopenia and not the typical presentation so yes there have been association even in the studies in the original studies there were a few of those events you know but i don't know if they're clearly being associated with the vaccine and definitely not with the phenomenon of thrombocytopenia and consumption which is what characterizes the the johnson and johnson and astra seneca clotting disorder so there's clots plus low platelets and glots exactly exactly yeah in general in inflammation and inflammation from any any recent natural infection or vaccination in theory can trigger an increase in the in the or pro coagulant state and also people naturally people who use birth control pills and as you know all the risk factors can have uh thrombosis even if they are or are not vaccinated so that that's a reality but definitely this this combination of blood platelets and also anti-pf4 antibodies with thrombosis in the splatnik and and other you know cabernet saunas and other venous area it's what characterizes these adenovirus vaccine reactions and they have not been described to my knowledge with with that with those characteristics with the mrna vaccines mr i think if there was any if there was a need to get uh a booster vaccine would you recommend that this young woman go with a different vaccine or would you feel okay recommended she uh get a booster yeah that's a good question i i mean was did she have any any risk factors i mean was like you know something that predisposer to the club that's what i would try to find out if it's really associated with the inflammation of the vaccine versus maybe she had a long travel to draw for six hours from one city to the other and then develop a dvt that would be most likely than the than the vaccine itself so i so i i don't know honestly i would have to to go case by case and see if it's worth uh taking the risk of the of the of of giving her the booster or not depending on the you know all the all the aspects around the event and how severe it was etc great thank you so much um uh harry seibold was mentioning that the he says as more of our population is vaccinated the risk benefit analysis that the cdc made would change correct will the fda and or j j re-evaluate the risk analysis as things progress yeah that's a good observation yeah if there are no risk of kobe uh at some point yeah the the the issue of the of the thrombosis may be that's a that's a very you know a good observation it may be more more of a concern if you if you're especially in the post uh post uh pandemic era uh people will probably select the safest vaccine as opposed to the one that's going to get you out of the of the pandemic so i think that's something yeah i think it's going to evolve over time but absolutely interesting comment yeah yeah thank you marla i don't know if you have any comment about that yeah i also thought it was a great point and um again in the cdc analysis they really did look at incidence rate of disease um as nestor recovered and sort of making this risk benefit calculation so um you know as the pandemic winds down and we have less uh you know fewer cases then that may obviously change and if we learn more about what the underlying risk factors are for people who develop this complication you know we expect then we've changes to the vaccine guidance but i think we just don't have enough to go on right now thank you marla i don't know ellen i don't know ellen are you able to i mean oh there you are i see you in front of me do you want to just talk really briefly about your your patient sure um it's a lean by the way just for future ellen thank you um yes so so this is a lady that does tend to have inflammation in general she has a head injury among other things that has caused that so she had a really pretty extreme reaction to the moderna vaccine both both shots really very severely swollen arm itching and pain lots and lots of redness so she told me earlier today and showed me that she had developed a rash like in the collarbone area and this may have nothing to do with the vaccine but it was three weeks after her second shot and she just wondered if anyone's been seeing skin inflammations that long after the vaccine if this is um a known issue and if it could possibly be related because i hadn't heard anything about anything yeah i'm trying to remember there was a paper in the new england that i discussed here about skin complications of of vaccination and they were actually delayed like eight days so it's probably within the within the range uh and i saw photos of of lesions in the elbows not exactly in the collarbone but actually distal i mean distant from the from the injection site so it's it's possible it is possible that this is a delay a hypersensitivity reaction something we see with like the fixed rocker option that can occur any anywhere in the body so it's possible because i remember there were i think 12 cases with the photos in the new england journal and some of them were a curve a few days after the the vaccination they were mostly with the first dose because that's what they they published the first dose and and then they gave a second dose to some of these patients but some of the lesions were away from the injection site because i remember the photos of elbows and other other areas of the body so it's possible thank you nestor marla did you have any comment i saw that you were shaking your head yeah thinking back to the uh study that nestor covered and i think um the range of symptom onset was four to 11 days with intermediate being eight days so yeah up to a couple of weeks out this definitely was observed i haven't seen any literature that talks about these delayed skin reactions beyond sort of that two-week period um but certainly anecdotally you know i've read a few things about it and heard that people have reported those thank you um thank you dan saltman asked an interesting question nestor about the the va study are there similar studies of excess burden of disease post infection from infection with other viruses like influenza in fact they they actually compare they look at the data from influenza in the ba and they compare post-influence and postcode and indefinitely postcode it was much worse in all sense i mean there was more resources utilization and everything of course there's some after influence especially heart failure and pneumonias that we see but this broad array of of you know things happening to the patient postcode was not described with influenza and they actually compared they did a small part of the of the of their study that i didn't even comment on that but they did compare uh post influenza with post kobe and it was definitely much worse with kobe but yeah that's a that's a great question but it was not even close it was really worse with kobe great thank you and then um deborah hill is asking if do we have any news to report on any vaccine studies in children under age 16 anybody heard anything marla have you heard yeah nothing new um i talked a couple of weeks ago about the fact that pfizer had uh requested a modification to their eua from fda to be able to vaccinate children down to age 12. um i thought we might have heard something from fda about that request so i'm a little surprised we haven't but it may have sort of been put on the back burner with the questions around j and j but i know that moderna has started their pediatric trials as well and released some preliminary data and are expected to request a modification to their eua you know sometime this spring was the time frame that they mentioned so i think we'll be seeing more about that uh soon carla can i ask a follow-up to marla about that i'm just wondering with with you know schools across the country you know now opening up and especially in new mexico i'm wondering um you know it seems that there's more of an urgency to get you know the 12 to 16 year old group vaccinated and even the younger group and also wanted to see how things are going in new mexico with cases and kids now that schools are open yeah i agree i think you know hopefully the goal is that uh by fall when schools reopen we have at least um some of our kids vaccinated you know if we were able to vaccinate middle school and high school uh populations i think that would go a long way to reopening schools fully and people feeling safe about sending their kids back to school we haven't seen a big bump in cases you know with the limited school reopening we've had so far but we are definitely monitoring that though some schools are real really still sort of standing up there um their testing strategies but we haven't seen a market increase in cases at this point great thank you um harry seibold are you on i can't see you on my screen i'm here yeah do you want to go ahead you want to ask your question about the the study in pregnant women um sure i just when you read what uh dr sosa posted dr shimabukuro there was a term no obvious safety signal i've never heard it worded that way is that the same thing as saying statistically there's no increase in adverse events to pregnant patients or was it meaning that it's just a gestalt rough look at things that we didn't see anything obvious i i just wasn't sure how to interpret that terminology yeah me neither i mean i think that the the fact that they just comparing what they have seen with the be safe uh reporting system and the published literature is sort of uh you know not a very robust analysis in that way they're not doing a comparison of vaccinated versus or unvaccinated it's actually you know comparing what what has occurred with this patient with what has been published in in the literature so i think that's where they they want to they they're so careful with the wording saying there's no obvious safety because they're not like following this patient longitudinally this is not a prospective story this is not a comparative story of vaccinated pregnant numbers who unvaccinated pregnant etc so i think it's that is that they didn't see any like red flags comparing what occurred to them with what it's normally occurring in the in the society or in the to to other uh populations in the same condition yeah thank you um i i don't know if you were going to say anything about this um evangelist asking about if you were going to talk at all about the situation in india and what do we know about the if there are variants there or it's just what your what your knowledge no i i'm sorry but i haven't really heard anything i know the situation is horrible i was listening to the bbc radio when i was coming into the hospital today and they're describing you know a really desperate situation with lack of oxygen lack of beds especially in new delhi and other large cities but i i don't know i don't understand what's happening if it's uh you know maybe a new variant circulating or or or something else i remember that at the beginning uh in march last year march april um i was worried that brazil and india which are you know highly populated areas were going to be the hot spots and it turned out to be the u.s and some other places in europe too much to my surprise and now sort of the virus is catching up with that reality the fact that these are you know large countries with a lot of poverty a lot of health uh issues and and social determinants of health in general uh but i don't know about the variance in in india what's going on with that thank you did anyone else on the hub team have a comment about that no okay um there's a question about i don't know minister do you have any do you what is known about the vaccines from the republic of china or any clinical studies that you've seen anything any reports yeah i've seen two publications out of south america brazil with the corona back and their efficacy or effectiveness because these were real life studies because i haven't seen a clinical study with the especially with the coronava which is the one that i use in latin america it's around 50 to 60 percent efficacy that's that's what they have published both chile and and brazil have published their this is real life uh uh effectiveness in the midst of a pandemic so with all the limitations that those publication uh entails it's um so around 60 efficacy which is not dissimilar to what have you been seeing with uh with astrosenica in in in south and south africa and other places yeah thank you i just wanted to let everybody know that the cme link went into the chat at about 12 44 please give us your feedback and if you want to like see me please fill that out and i'll turn it back over to joanna thanks carla um jeffrey miller has a question uh nestor leslie about wondering about the pathophysiology that from patients who've had covet that results in increased diabetes or hyperlipidemia i wondered if you kind of have know about that or read about what might be causing that if it's a inflammatory process or yeah unless you want to say something um i know in general any sort of physical stress increases level of stress hormones which tends to make people more insulin resistant and so it it seems to make sense that since covet is such an incredible physical stress all those um circulating hormones are i'm gonna make people more insulin resistant and more likely to develop diabetes but i haven't read any direct you know this is causing this that causes this so i think dan saltman do you want to unmute i think you responded a little bit to jeff miller's question i i saw a piece that was about the uh the the oh thank you i'm sorry i just unmuted and jumped in but thank you thank you joanna uh i saw a piece that was about the impact of the the gut biogenome on on covet infection it was sort of a specific thing and the the proposal was that maybe that goes some distance in explaining why obesity and and diabetes are a higher risk for uh for complications so i was wondering if what if you had any thoughts on that no i do not i haven't really read that article and i agree with leslie um and i think there are two phenomenons here one is the inflammation and and the fact that the patient have an acute stressor some of the patients also um especially the relatively young the 40 the 50 year old who were diabetic and didn't know they were diabetic because i remember when when we saw the patients in the hospital a lot of them said no i've never checked my sugar before i you know i didn't know i was diabetic and they turned out to have like 180 160 so not like a horrible diabetes but they were uh you know some glucose intolerance and and this hospitalization basically detected that because we have to do all the of the blood test so i think those two factors are playing the third factor is it's uh it's sort of more concerning do the virus invades the pancreas and i have seen papers talking about the beta cells having the ace receptor and the tmp the the co the enzyme that actually activates the virus to so so there is this theoretically possibly theoretical possibility that some diabetes may be because of direct attack of the virus to the to the pancreas but obviously it's all like hypothetical so all of those are our possible hypotheses for this link and obviously the microbiome is an interesting one i haven't read about that but i guess um it's also possible so i think we need more information to be able to and probably it's going to be all of the above there's going to be some patients who actually have like a direct autoimmune attack into the pancreas other virus attacking to the pancreas and other are just decompensating their uh undiagnosed but but pre-existing diabetes you know the hospitalization and the dexamethasone that we're giving them also helping in that regard then the one other thing is that for type 1 diabetes um i think that the theory is that all viruses but in particular cobit can cause auto antibodies that uh destroy the pancreas so thanks for that great mini discussion that was awesome um i think related dr hayes to one of your studies dr seibold kind of is interested in you know that one patient that infected the you know kind of created 46 other cases um that you talked about he's wondering um about contact tracing what was the calculated are not um and what purpose was the variant there do you remember about that case yeah i know they said it it was not a named variant it was definitely um a variant that was new to kentucky um but it didn't sound like it was a variant with a name or a specific one and um they did not calculate are not in that and um the contact tracing they did was that they talked about in the paper was limited to the nursing home which they did by instituting the daily testing for all residents and twice likely for all healthcare personnel i think they may have actually bumped it up to daily for the healthcare personnel and they did mention they were using the rapid antigen test and they said they probably did miss some cases because of the fact that that is less sensitive than the pcr so that really was a super spreader yeah i was watching the academy awards last night and i was wondering kind of did people who attended have to get their a vaccine in a vaccine car or how did they you know what was why was the guy who runs the academy academy why was he so positive that it was such a safe environment you know i was wondering all those questions as i was having fun watching the academy awards but anyway well my my daughter is a big fan of the tv show the bachelor and the bachelorette and they require everybody to go into 14 days of quarantine and be tested before they can actually be on the show for which i just there's i wouldn't want to be on the bachelor in any way but especially the idea of having to go into quarantine for 14 years yeah i do not think they did that for the academy awards last night for sure yeah interesting they really wanted to showcase that you do not need to wear masks indoors that was a very big goal of theirs it will be interesting um nestor do you have any thoughts on that last day in the defense of the academy which i never thought i was going to defend the academy they changed the venue from the usual theater that they do it to this area which is bigger et cetera and they were able to space the tables that's what they said in in their defense yeah so it was not like the usual usual theater everybody's sitting everybody hugging and kissing each other they they actually have certain rules and one of the rules where they change the venue into like a sort of a hunger type of area you know bigger area no drinks yeah exactly so that was they did some efforts to decrease the risk it was very interesting to watch interestingly enough anthony hopkins 83 didn't show up just in case [Laughter] yeah yeah um kim joy has a question for uh for anybody and clarissa i think in particular um she wants to know um uh the accuracy of the home um over-the-counter antigen uh tests i think called binax now um clarissa are you on sure yeah um so the the binax test that's being um sold over the counter it's it's the exact same as the binax test that's um used in drive-through locations maybe the one that was used at the nursing homes um that leslie was just mentioning um and so we've we've seen local studies um as well as studies um and other that other groups have done that even in symptomatic patients the uh sensitivity is probably in the low to mid 80s at best in asymptomatic patients the sensitivity is even less and that was when the test was performed by either trained laboratory personnel or or trained clinicians who'd received some type of formal training and getting the test done the challenge is now with the test being provided over the mark over the counter there's just a um you know instructions um and for anybody who's done any kind of over-the-counter test that can be a little bit confusing i haven't bought one yet myself but other colleagues have and they've said it is you know a little cumbersome and maybe a little bit difficult to figure out how to do that testing um so so we do we do have some concern i think about just the overall performance of the test in the hands of the routine users so i don't know that we have data in its over-the-counter form but we do have data in its standard form and i think somebody else also said asked about specificity the test itself has really has good analytical specificity but remember even a test at 95 analytical specificity if it's in a low prevalent setting you still have a higher risk of having a false positive than a true positive when you just go back to the basic um you know mass around sensitivity specificity and prevalence um so keeping that test focused on symptomatic people is definitely um an important thing for us to consider uh thanks dr colbert how much is the over the counter how much is the test i think it was 27 for two tests there's a kit it has um each of the kits has um two tests in it and it's twenty seven dollars great thank you thank you um doc dr uh ben dates and dr julie broyles uh kind of both have are interested in a issue that maybe uh marlar nester might want to help answer um they they asked are asking if the if the present emergency youth authorizations are lifted um are and we're still considering that many americans are kind of unvaccinated and might want to remain unvaccinated is there discussion about mandating vaccination for healthcare workers students etc and i'm guessing you know different employers um nestor marla do you want to take a stab at that sure i can start um there's definitely a lot of conversation about this obviously especially as it's approved hopefully um for children you know does this and depending on the trajectory of the pandemic does this become part of your routine uh childhood vaccine recommendations you know right now most of the vaccine mandates like if you look at influenza vaccine requirements are really employer-based um or specific uh policies of educational institutions rather than um you know a department of health policy or a national policy you know and i think probably that's where we'll uh see the vaccine mandates first and we're already seeing that in some universities is that um you know private groups and employers are going to be the first to come out with these um requirements just like they do with the annual influenza vaccine you know i think it'll be probably a while until we have full fda approval acip makes some recommendations until we would see this maybe rolled into um you know a state level vaccine requirement so i think we're probably um you know quite a ways out from seeing something like that happen if it does thank you marla i definitely know several a private like universities are saying in the fall you're going to need students are going to need to bring their vaccinations one of them being new york university and others are gearing up towards that i think um any other thoughts nestor or carla carissa on that no my son school oh go ahead my son school required everybody to sign that they would get the cova vaccine when it came out and they are in the process of vaccinating the entire student body they've had i think sixty percent um have gotten at least one and twenty percent are fully vaccinated so i think thanks leslie nestor no i have no comment i mean i i just can't say you know that there are some precedents obviously like i can give you the the in latin america we are obligated to have yellow fever vaccine if you go to certain countries mostly to travel so that's something that and and just so trouble mandated vaccines have been there for forever so so i don't know if that's going to be the the place where they're going to mandate maybe some country will do that well if you want to go do tourism or do something in a country you need to show proof of vaccination somehow but i honestly don't know what's gonna because there have been some so many politicized aspects of this pandemic that i don't wanna really predict what's gonna happen with the vaccination right well everyone we're at the top of the hour thank you so much i wanted to let you know we continue to have many other echo programs including the first responder echo at two o'clock today we have a great speaker from silver hill hospital physician dr andrew gerber talking about residential treatment for patients with substance use and mental health issues and many patients who are having difficult time regarding covid19 are benefiting from residential uh treatment and he'll be talking about mental health resiliency um and then on may 6 the critical care echo will be focused on a covet 19 i believe vaccine clots and how to manage them with michelle parkins and then on thursday this thursday we have our mental health and resiliency echo with the ihs and um i think that's it carla do you have any last-minute announcements um no i think it's i think that on the may 6th it's going to be about anti-coagulation in the on the in the hospitalized setting oh okay okay excuse me and thank you um i think that's it and we'll see you next week and carissa has a presentation for us we'll look forward to thank you everybody,,4/26/2021
47,hi everybody can you hear me great okay i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm welcome everybody to our infectious disease office hours it is may 10th uh 12 noon mountain time and uh welcome uh to this uh weekly session with dr nestor sosa dr leslie hayes and the rest of our team i wanted to remind you to keep your um to keep your line muted and turn your camera on if you have that opportunity it's perfectly all right to eat and drink for many of you it's your lunch hour uh please be reminded that kent knows worthy our digital librarian will be putting in evidence-based evidence-guided material into the chat and i think you will enjoy getting that material and then 45 minutes after the hour you can get the cme link and even if you don't need cme please fill that out we do i'll look at that at least once a month and see how you are all doing and see how we can improve these sessions so without further ado going to turn it over to our leader dr nester sosa who is a professor in the department of internal medicine the infectious disease lead and he's our great champion here and he has a presentation followed by dr leslie hayes thank you thank you very much joanna so yes i'm amnestos i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm let me share the screen putting on presentation mode okay so yes i um today i'm going to review several uh articles uh some of them are somewhat extensive so i'm going to be quick um the this photo i just want to make references for i found in one of the articles the the uh pink dots here are the the coronavirus and this is like the surface of a cell so so you have an idea how many how many viruses are you know trying to enter or touching on the in this on this cell i thought it was a nice a nice photograph so start with some good news before i give you some bad news essentially this is the graph that i actually got from dr shan update that she does here at unm on the on the kobe's hospitalization in the u.s and you can see obviously that there's a significant decrease if you compare with like november december where we were in hospitalization and where we are and and i'm showing this because i just read an article on mnwr on the forecast for the next few months and it was somewhat for me somewhat disappointed and i'm going to go through that the article is actually this is the name of the paper uh modeling of future copy 19 cases hospitalization and death um according to vaccination rates and and npi the non-pharmacolog pharmaceutical intervention um and actually what the cdc did they actually invited six different modeling teams from you know throughout the united states they gave them some general guide guidance on how to how to uh create some some potential scenarios and then these six modeling teams actually um did a prediction on what's going to happen with the cases hospitalizations and and death from kobe 19 in the next few months here in the us and these are some of the assumptions they actually have like a four four scenario they they put high vaccination or low vaccination and then moderate mpi or non pharmaceutical interventions and low so they have four possible uh situations high high low low or high low low highs so as you may imagine and these are the definitions of what they consider a high vaccination or a high mpi um estimation and what i found surprising were the results in all of this exercise they actually uh calculated the four scenarios and you can see here uh the low low low vaccination low mpi is obviously the the the solid line and and then low vaccination moderate and in all cases they predicted um sort of a search in the in late may early june despite the you know the effort to vaccinate people even the most optimistic scenario which is the the the one with the the line and the dot here uh still there's a there's a minimal increase number of cases obviously if no intervention is done there are more cases which could could be a you know close to 40 50 cases per week uh in the in the beginning of june uh but the good news if you're if you're an optimist is that that even in the worst scenario the cases are going to go down um right before the fall so so but but obviously this this study underlines the importance of continuing some type of non-uh pharmacological intervention as we move forward with the vaccination effort and how important it is to to try to convince people to get vaccinated because in in several these scenarios we're going to have a surge small surge in the number of hospitalization and cases and these are the number of death also with the same shape and this is really consistent uh among all the all the different uh modeling groups that did this exercise so i think that's that's the the message of these of this interesting publication there are some other leaders but i i wanted to highlight that that we we certainly need to to continue the effort in getting people vaccinated and getting some type of of mpis until we're really out of the woods or completely out of the pandemic the other the other article that i want to mention uh it's about a new vaccine i think several months ago i actually presented some data on the novavax vaccine and we haven't really talked about it a lot because you know although the headline has been um uh all of the pfizer moderna and astrosenic and johnson and you're gonna have like like uh uh get all the got all the attention from from the publication but i think nova box is another vaccine and just to just as a refresher this uh this is a recombinant protein vaccine that actually uses the the the spike protein and and the way they make it it's really interesting they use cell from from uh from an insect and they infected with a vacuum of virus which is a pathogen of of insects and they including the vacuum virus the gene to synthetize the profusion uh conformation of the s protein so basically the plant i'm sorry that the cells start producing this this s protein um which is the the surface protein from the from the uh sarsko ii and then this this because it's just a protein they usually combine it with a plant-based a saponin-based matrix m and i i think i presented this paper but the way they look under the microscope the the spike protein arranged and solves in this rosette this nice looking almost like a small flower and this is the the sapling uh matrix so it's a it's a it's a different uh sort of a cage and and this is the way that the the this vaccine is formulated with this adjuvant and then the rosettes of spike protein and that's what what administers so the story was actually published in the new england journal and it's the they actually publish the data of the nova box vaccine in south africa against the south african variant the the b1351 and what's interesting well they enrolled mostly young young patients um so they were like 4 000 patients in in this study 2000 in every group in the vaccine group and placebo group and they use one dose of the of the of the nova box vaccine in this relatively young population and the main the the the main finding was actually the efficacy was around 50 percent so and this is against again most of this patient had the the south african uh variance so so this is comparable um to some of the other studies with these uh with these uh with this variant which is one of the most troublesome and they actually divided patients uh because as you know in south africa there's a very high prevalence of hiv so they divided the the cohort among hiv positive and hiv negative and amongst among those who are hiv negative because it was around 60 so slightly slightly better than than the general 50 efficacy because that included some uh hiv patients and these are the graph basically the placebo and the vaccine we have we are now used to seeing this graph it was better obviously in those hiv negative it was more more of a separation between the cases in the in the placebo will keep going up as opposed to the know about vaccine which the cases are kind of flat but one of the most interesting finding of this study was what happened in the placebo group and is that those who receive a placebo if they had covered or did not have copied they have the same incidence of copy 19 which that means that that if you had copy before with this variant there's no protection you know so so that it was really surprising and interesting that that you had the same risk of developing covet if you were not vaccinated this is like the natural history of the disease people exposed to these new variants were as likely to get copied again as those who had copied already so so this basically in this well-def designed study to prove the efficacy of the vaccine they found this you know sort of uh serendipitous finding that that actually you have no protection and this is this is basically the timeline of the of the different variants in in south africa and you can see the square here or the rectangle is where they did the story most of the most of the cases were obviously uh due to the to the variant to the to the 501 v2 variant which is the the south african also known as the 351 so but this finding was kind of impressive that there's no protection against this this 351 even if you had kobe so if you were in the placebo same incident which was interesting um the other uh vaccine story that i want to share with you and this is something that we have asked do immunocompromised patients develop vaccines develop antibodies after vaccination are they protected and we are already starting to get data on these published data and this is a this is a publication from john hopkins in which they measure the antibody production in patients who had received solid organ uh transplants before so included liver kidney lung etc um this was the publication is a research letter um and and uh from from from from john hawkins and what they found uh and let me go let me uh take you through the to this table they basically notice that there were three types of patient patients who did not respond at all to the two doses of the vaccine those one negative those two negatives so no antibody response those who actually responded to the second dose but not to the first and those who responded to both so if you want to just simplify like around 54 of these patients had a good antibody response 46 did not so so obviously this is much less response as compared to immunocompetent patients where the responses are 99 98 percent almost everybody mounts a good antibody response and then the efficacy we know in clinical trials is around 94 to 95 and this is mrna vaccines um so that was the first phenomenon so obviously these solid organ transplant patients that are taking immunosuppressive um they they just just barely half of them a little bit more than half of them actually react to the to the vaccine and some of them have no reaction to the first law so a large percentage have no reaction but finally with the second dose they got a better a better response obviously there is sort of a an age related relationship the older you are the less likely you are to response it's it's always this way so almost 50 percent of those um over 60 had no no response so so a little bit less than that than the whole group the group as a whole there was no significant difference in the gender response and other factors was the the type of of organ um the the worst uh response was probably long with with 61 having no no immunity or no antibody production um obviously the pancreas is it was very small the number eighty percent but there were only four patients but definitely if you have lung compared to let's say liver or kidney that had a better a better uh response overall and also the the and this is something that we know from from infectious disease and and from transplant medicine that the longer you are from your transplant the better you are so you you see like those who were less than three years had a 63 non-response as opposed to those who were more than 12 years had only a 33 non-response so obviously if you if you if your patient is recently transplanted and was vaccinated he's more susceptible uh to have kobe because the lack of of response of the antibody so so i i really like this trial it was uh you know around 658 transplant subject it was not thousands of subjects but it starts to tell some story about it and there was also a difference i'm sorry i forgot to mention about the different if if the patient was on a mycophenolate or one of these anti-metabolites either mycophenolate or acetioprine um the response was much less than if it was only on prednisone and and cyclosporine so so there's also a difference of what they are receiving currently uh to the degree of of immune response to the to the vaccines to the mrna vaccines the other paper that i i'm just going to summarize in one table is the durability of a humeral immune response to to sars kobe 2 this is um it's going to be published in some reports and i just like the the graph of these the summary graph of this paper uh which was sort of a complicated immune paper and i'm not going to go through all the details but to make a long story short this is sort of the evaluation of the of the humeral immunity response to sarcobit ii um as measured by antibodies again the spike in patients who have the natural infection and and to make a long story short both the memory b cells and the igg anti-spike antibody last for at least six months what we lose relatively early are the igm as you might expect and the neutralization okay but at least there's evidence of sort of a long-lasting eight-month in this case 31 32 weeks um off of the antibody producing b cells and also some of the antibody cell uh cytotoxicity so these are probably the longest uh you know follow-up publications on on the the natural infection duration of immunity which is already around eight months according to these these authors and finally it's been a while since i have presented anything on therapy we have really concentrated on vaccine but i i thought it was important you remember the recovery trial was the one that gave us the dexamethasone recommendation is this this real life or close to real life trial that they're doing in in the uk with with thousands of patients uh randomized to different arms so now they finally published because i have seen this in pre-publication but they finally published the il-6 inhibitor toscillis map in hospitalized patient and actually um is the second drug that clearly demonstrates decreasing mortality together with the dexamethasone now we have the tosaliso map and and a high percentage of patients who are receiving um so i'm going to go through this uh trial so it was published in the lancet a few days ago to silicon map and patients admitted to the hospital would cover it so these were all sorts of you know patients with with um with copic diagnosis and you can see these are the the two groups so 63 uh years is the mean age so they were sort of the the high high group and in fact they had like almost one quarter of them were over 70 so this was definitely different from the from the vaccine study we saw from south africa and there were there was also significant ventilatory support so so more or less 50 of the patient with either a non-invasive ventilation or already on mechanical ventilation so these were patients with you know fairly um severe or advanced uh kobe uh infection or kobe 19 infection they ended up randomizing 2000 in each arm so conventional therapy versus for versus docile isumab and this is all the whole design the whole recovery if you remember was over twenty thousand patients and these are all the arms called xenonsation uh acetomycin etc but but this is just concentrating on the tosilizumab and to make a long story short they found a benefit modest but but a very um solid difference in in the mortality and also in the possibility or probability of being discharged our lives so so to to positive outcome and you can see the kaplan mayor um of being discharged alive always better with the with the tosylisimap group compared to the standard of care and then it was also consistent across all patients age gender racial or ethnicity uh if you were on ventilator support or not they were you know most of the most of these findings were to the left favoring the tosilisium up and obviously the the overall overall benefit was uh with with a risk ratio of point uh 85 so means 15 percent better uh uh probability of survival at 28 days with the silicon map and then numerically so it was 15 percent for 28 day mortality at 20 to 22 better chance of being discharged also there was less risk of renal failure and less risk of developing or going on to the need mechanical ventilation so pretty positive i mean not dramatic i mean we're not talking 80 decrease in mortality we're talking 15 to 20 percent decrease in all this risk factor but nevertheless something better than that we have seen with other drugs like hydroxychloroquine even rendezvous has not been able to prove decreased mortality overall so that that was a positive and this is sort of a summary of all the studies um now with the recovery added to all the studies of ilisumab we can see that the the this forest plot is to the left so there's some benefits i think uh people after they they have time to digest this recovery star story uh i think some of the maybe the the nih or the idsa will move toward a more recommendation of this tosilism up in the in the future that that's sort of my my guess especially for patients who are hospitalized with increasing inflammatory markers and finally just one graph uh um about about the the b117 before we we presented this data here at the office hours uh we said that the there was a fight between the b117 and the california strains now the most recent um data on on our on our uh on our or the strains or the variance of concern you can see that now the the light orange b117 it's almost 60 it has really um defeated the 429 one of the california strains and some of the older all the original uh strains so now this is the most common throughout the united states and it's also the case for new mexico according to the the group that is working uh on this information here in the in the in the department of health in unm and the national laboratories okay i think that was it thank you thanks thank you dr sosa so much um i wanted to quickly turn it over to dr leslie hayes our primary care and addiction specialist hi thank you um so dr sosa i think you need to convince the id folks to come up with a different name than either the b117 because those are too hard to remember but i agree that the place names are not correct so i think maybe name them like they do hurricanes name them after you know uh people or something but we need a different naming system for them so i agree so there were some questions last week about vaccine hesitancy so i'm going to talk today about how to address vaccine hesitancies so and just some general advice if you're trying to talk to patients about vaccine first off all of this works better if you have a positive relationship with the person you're trying to convince you know don't even bother with aunt muriel who thinks you're an idiot because of who you voted for president last year it's just not good focus on people you already have a good relationship with second is to try to really listen and you don't want to listen with the idea of refuting the argument or um but you really want to listen and attempt to understand their concerns and i must say that this one actually um when i was in college i was having a political argument with someone i don't even remember what it was about but i remember that person sat down and listened to me for about 15 minutes and then recited my argument back and then said you know i still don't think i agree with you and that persuaded me to their point of view better than anything they could have said um so if you really understand people's um concerns it really does go a long way to being able to talk to them about it um know the science and be prepared to discuss it but also use anecdotes people really like anecdotes and it's been shown that it actually helps to get people to um take things more seriously so have anecdotes both about cobit patients who've gotten really sick or developed long covered and also anecdotes about the vaccine and um motivational interviewing is really great in this scenario um i found this wonderful article about something called the case approach which i've never heard of before um it was published in minnesota medicine in the march and april issue and k stands for corroborate a is about me s is the science and e is explained and advised so basically um first off you do what we already talked about is the listing very carefully and then you frame a response that corroborates what they've said um it's you know sort of discussing what their concerns are and then you make an about me statement which is sort of how you feel about it how you approached it then as you talk about the science underlying the recommendation and um or explaining their concerns and then finally explain your advice to the patient and i'm going to give an example but i really encourage you to go read the articles because they've got about six different examples of how to use this and it was just so helpful so patient 2 feels like the vaccine was rushed i'm hearing this first off you sort of corroborate so it does seem like the vaccine came out very quickly compared to the usual time course for vaccines and then say about me so i say i i truly was a little bit worried about how quickly it came out um until i did some reading and then i talked about the science when i did the reading i discovered that they actually went through all the steps they usually do for vaccines they just did it a lot more efficiently than usual because of the urgency of the situation and then explain in advice as your doctor i feel the vaccine is safe and they've done adequate study when you get it um and like i said you might want to look at the article because it really was a very helpful article on explaining how to use these and then some specific arguments um that my covet physician group has come up with online that i thought were useful we don't know the long-term effects of the vaccine and while this is true vaccines rarely cause long-term effects and we do know that covid causes plenty of long-term effects including lung disease heart disease diabetes and neurological symptoms and people who talk about the death rate is low for younger people again talk about the long-term effects and then i find this the most puzzling art argument that people but i hear this from people a lot i have a lot of health problems i am afraid the vaccine will make them worse and so with these help to talk about the patients may feel bad for a few days but it's rare that the vaccine causes any long-term worsening of health problems and they are at significant risk of problems from cobalt if they get it because of their health problems and then this was another one i really liked i'm young and i'm unlikely to get sick from cobit what does it matter to me and people said they've had really good success talking with about as long as young people are getting coveted they will be passing it on to more vulnerable people and we're going to have to continue the restrictions the sooner we can get sufficient number of young people vaccinated the sooner we can begin to lift the restrictions and people are saying they've actually had pretty good response to that particular argument and then i was a little embarrassed this last week one of my um patients called and she said i don't know if i want to get this vaccine they said it's not fda approved and so i was able to sort of go through and explain to her why um you know i still felt it was safe but i realized i didn't fully know the difference between fda approval and emergency use authorization unfortunately i was reasonably close and this is from the fda website and emergency use authorization means that the they feel there's good enough data but there's not as much data as would be needed for fda approval but they do have to have enough data to say that the intervention is safe and affected for its intended use and that the product can be made according to federal quality standards and they carefully balance all the potential risks and benefits of the product so even though it's not quite as strong of data as needed for fda approval it's still pretty strong and then this was very very interesting this woman is heather simpson and she was a big anti-vaccine advocate in texas for a few years and she ended up deciding she wanted to get the copic shot and so this article was just about her and why she decided to get it and then um i think i've mentioned your local epidemiology she actually did an interview with her and it's well worth reading just to kind of understand sort of the anti-vaccine mindset and there are a few things i got out of this from uh reading what she had to say so heather simpson became an anti-vaxxer she was i think considering or had just gotten pregnant and wanted to learn a little bit more about um vaccines and she said she ended up watching a nine-hour documentary that she found on facebook and she said she was especially convinced when she found a half dozen anti-vaccine doctors and i believe the anti-vaccine or kind of math vaccine doctors are very very harmful because people really do pay attention to them and she said if you're at all prone to fear it was very hard not to be convinced by this documentary which really um you know went after the fear and so she said she posted a mildly anti-vaccine post on facebook and she received many friend requests from anti-vaccine advocates and she also said she got a lot of vitriol from pro-vaccine forces and she states to solidify her anti-vaxx resolve so you know think about it if you see an anti-vaxx post maybe not attack the person because that often can push them further into the other camp and she said eventually she got frustrated because people were just opposed to anything medical and she had needed something medical and she started looking at the other side and she actually pointed out there's a spectrum from vaccine hesitant to extreme anti-vaxx and she said you know sort of first is vaccine hesitant then people who are just scared but not necessarily going one way or the other ex-faxers are people who had vaccinated their kids and their kids afterwards developed something such as adhd or autism spectrum disorder and they didn't have a good explanation for it and so they just chose the vaccines then the people who are 100 natural don't want to do any supplements um like conspiracy theorists and then what she referred to as the lizard people who are sort of extreme um conspiracy theorists and she said for the people who are just scared often just getting them the facts and if you can get them the facts before they've really gone down the anti-vaxx rabbit hole it can be very helpful so these are the people who often will respond to facts and understanding how things work um for the x facts there's one thing she said and this is obviously not a short-term solution but we need to get alternate explanations besides the vaccine for why children are developing autism spectrum disorder or adhd or some of these other conditions because right now often we don't have a good explanation for why children develop these and so it's easy for people to latch onto vaccine 100 natural the people who won't touch any pharmaceuticals i must admit i haven't had great success with these although some of them i do find it interesting um you know won't take the vaccines but they will take antibiotics them for these conditions when they get them and so i will talk to them sort of about what i view as the risk antibiotics and why i would much i'd take 50 flu shots over an extra course of antibiotics and that can sometimes be helpful um like conspiracy theorists i have found that sometimes we'll respond to actual conspiracies on the other side and um one thing and i i don't remember where this was but the media literacy um uh group out of albuquerque several years ago had a video where they taught teens about cigarette advertising and sort of all of the um uh manipulation and everything that goes into cigarette ads and it made them very strong um anti-tobacco ad um advocates and so realizing that you know because initially that they kind of thought there was smoking but then they realized the conspiracy was actually from the tobacco companies and the extreme anti-vaxxers are probably not worth spending a lot of time on at this point because you're probably not going to make much of a difference there and then paid people and i was unable to find actually the original research um that this article from the new york times was based on but uh it was on based on data from the ucla covered 19 health and politics project and so they said if we give you 100 bucks but this make you more or less likely to get a vaccine and 34 said they would be more likely 15 actually said they'd be less likely because they were like oh if they're paying me there must be something wrong with it um so you increased it about 19 if you offered people money for it a little bit less if you offered them less money and then they also found that the possibility that you could go without a mask was an incentive but interestingly people who are unvaccinated often don't think they need a mask so if you looked at um the likelihood of people um getting the vaccine if they no longer had to wear a mask um versus still having to wear a mask it went up they divided it out by all these different groups it went up the most in republicans um more in white people than black people overall it people were 13 percent more likely to get the vaccine if they thought they could um stop wearing a mask but interestingly the number of people in the last two weeks who died at a restaurant who were not vaccinated was 53 fully vaccinated 32 percent of them dined at a restaurant um gathering outdoors with more than 10 um non-family members um again the non-vaccinated were more likely to do that so um they may not they need so to begin with so that may not be much of an incentive to get them vaccinated for a lot of people and then some interesting articles um uh evaluation and management of code 19 in pregnancy and contemporary ob gyn was just a good summary of all the literature on coping 19 in pregnancy and in my family my daughter got pfizer so she is refers to herself as team pfizer most of the rest of us got moderna and my son got johnson and johnson and we have all sorts of ridiculous arguments about who's the coolest because of which vaccine we got but this was a pretty funny article about why johnson johnson is the coolest and then this was a nice article by i believe she's either a pediatric infectious disease doctor or pediatric hospital so i can't remember which um on kids vaccines are on the way and why um uh parents should get that vaccine if you want to show it to any of the parents in your practice so and that was everything i have thank you dr hayes fantastic really good skills and communication points for us all about vaccine hesitancy and i wanted to introduce dr cecilia thompson cecilia are you are you there mrs one of the medical directors at tricor i am here i don't have anything to update today but i'm happy to take any questions regarding testing fantastic uh thank you cecilia and i think uh we don't have marla sivers on on the call uh just yet today um but i'm gonna turn it over to dr thornton thank you joanna hi everyone carla thornton here with infectious diseases at unm um nice to see everybody so we have a bunch of questions i'm just going to start from the earlier ones um this can be for either of you uh dr ellen caro was asking will new mexico pursue pursue herd immunity as others give up on that goal any any thoughts about that so dr fauci actually had an interview on npr last week and he said no we're not giving up on herd immunity he said the problem is it's just hard to have that as your goal because we don't really know what the threshold is and he said our goal is still to vaccinate as many people as possible so it's not like they've given up it's just sort of they've changed the goal to just being let's just keep vaccinating and figure out how to get as many people as we can vaccinated thanks leslie nest or anything no i i mean for me it's like saving money to for my retirement i mean i'm not gonna say i'm gonna save a million dollar if i save a million and a half it's i'm happier if i say you know two million so i think it's it's you have to make the best effort to vaccinate as many people as possible you don't you're not going to stop at 65 or 70 or 75 just get everybody vaccinated and we get this over i mean the the the hair immunity is just a concept epidemiological concept but in reality the reality is that you try to vaccinate as many people and fight hesitancy etc i think that's that's the key not obsessed on a number thank you nester in reference to the the information you gave about the transplant patients leslie hayes was asking should we check antibody levels in patients with organ transplant after vaccine to document immunity sorry yeah i haven't really thought about it um if but if if anything it would be in that in that population if you if you if you're going to measure in somebody or in some group it would be immunosuppressed to see but we need to have a correlator protection which is i'm not sure we have a complete clear idea that what level of antibodies protection and which one is not it's it's a little bit more complicated i mean there have been efforts by research groups to try to find a correlate between neutralizing antibodies and and vaccine efficacy but it's hard you know when there's so many commercially available and maybe cecilia can make a comment on these two uh to say okay you have whatever 3.5 you know level of antibiotics protected or not it's kind of hard for me to to to find that magic number go ahead yeah and i'll just add that there are um diagnostic tests available to determine whether you have antibodies that are due to vaccine or due to natural immunity but nestor's right there's no cut off for whether this is a protective level of antibody or not those studies are still ongoing so they're not part of the diagnostic test thank you very much um john foster asked a really interesting and important question can you explain the mechanism of why vaccines appear to provide better protection than natural infection which doesn't seem to be the case for most other infectious diseases right i can try to speculate a little bit based on what i have read in the uh especially the discussions of the papers about immunity and is that the natural infection when you when you're dealing with the virus the virus does have like inhibitors of the immune system so the virus tries hard to fight your immune system and and uh they are like you know uh proteins in the in the virus especially the the open reading frame that that antagonize the interferon etc so you do not mount a perfect immune response as opposed to when you are vaccinated and then you have a booster again uh there is a more robust specific uh antibody with all the you know the anti immune system proteins that may be playing a factor when you are sick with covet so that's that's the best explanation that people can come up uh and and another reason for the for getting the the vaccine even if you have kobe you know you have to get a dose of the vaccine and then you mount a more robust immune system because the virus doesn't allow you to mount the ideal immune response because that's part of the mechanism in which he he um he's successful you know causing disease impairing your your ability to respond to it great thank you necessarily um i'm gonna see if julie brockmeyer if you can if you have audio can you admit yourself and ask your question yes my question was in regards to the recent um recommendations for how soon after getting being positive with covid you should get the vaccine i know that the cdc has said 90 days i know that i've also heard two weeks um i am talking about a a patient without comorbidities who was non-hospitalized but still has myalgias and three weeks out right that's that's a good question i don't think we have like a definitive answers and i've seen two schools those who who recommend vaccination as soon as possible in order not to miss an opportunity to vaccinate so if you have somebody who's under your care and hackability let's say a month ago you can probably vaccinate him right there if you think he's going to be lost a follow-up or you're not going to see him again because there's no there's no absolute contraindication for vaccination the idea of the three-month uh it's number one to because that person presumably during those first three months after kobe um it's somewhat protected from having a reinfection so there's no rush and if you want to use that dose on an unvaccinated people or person it's even better because you're using the dose more rationally when a person has zero protection versus somebody who maybe has an 80 percent protection from the natural infection so that's that's the other reason i recently actually last week i reviewed a paper in which for the first time they tried to see the immune response on those who had copied um uh in association with the time when they were vaccinated and there seems to be like a sweet spot after a month of having kobe you get a better response a better antibody response so if you get the vaccine too close to the acute infection you're you're not going to mount a a pretty good uh antibody level so there's there's some data now coming out that probably you have to wait a little bit at least a month but you can safely wait you know more than that because you're protected from a reinfection so from a sort of a epidemiological point of view you can wait up to the three months which is which is from some of the recommendations so but that's the data that we have and the second part to that was um i have heard and i don't know if this is anecdotal or not that sometimes getting the vaccine will cure those symptoms right there yeah that's that's another good question for people who would long call it uh there have been a few studies that are showing that after vaccination patients with long-coverage symptoms a percentage not all of them and it's not you know like super dramatic there is a percentage of them who actually improve and no and there's no evidence that they get worse so so the the you know it's not a hundred percent the paper that i review is more around around 25 percent of those who have done copy had an improvement in their symptoms obviously if you're one of those you're going to say oh i got much better than the vaccine but there's some other in the in the surveys that actually didn't improve dramatically after vaccination uh but there is at least the reassurance that that most of them got better or at least didn't didn't didn't get any worse thank you thank you julie for those great questions um nestor uh harry seibold had a question about it looked like on your slide uh in the tesla map study that the people that were older than 80 years of age did not have um benefit is that is that correct yeah i would have to go back to the paper i don't remember and i'm wondering if that is because of the small number of patients in that group i am i would have to review the slides let me go back here okay and well um yeah it was to the left just to answer it was to the left of the graph it's just that it crossed one the the confidence interval were basically crossing one but the but the the mean was to the left so it was beneficial but it was too broad of a confidence interval because of the number of subjects um in in that uh in that group great thank you so much um we have a question about the brazil variant any any um information about that necessary that you have no i i review i mean we will review here uh uh a couple of papers on the immune response and um there is a there is an immune response and they are neutralizing antibodies they are not affected the the neutralizing antibodies especially the mrna vaccines induce antibodies which are in between the the uk and the south africans so the brazilian in the in the antibody levels it's sort of in between the worst case scenario would be the south african which is the one that that you generate less um less of a neutralizing antibody the uk seems to be almost unaffected by by regarding neutralizing antibodies so the brazilian seems to be in between the two the south african and uh and the uk variant but that's that's the only thing i have seen obviously there is a concern on the ground in brazil because they're using um one of the chinese vaccine the corona back that is not very effective but this is just anecdotal i mean we don't have data on on efficacy specifically against the brazilian uh strain in in in clinical stories thank you um i wanted to see also if anne corley slain if you if you have audio if you can ask your question because it has a several different parts to it and if you can just introduce yourself sure my name's anne corliss lane i'm actually an infection preventionist nurse in michigan um so i've been doing a lot of studying with virology and just trying to learn about the whole process of the mutant virus and what i've been trying to research is if there's actually any clinical studies proving that those variants are more contagious or do they have a higher binding affinity with the ace receptors or is it just kind of coincidental because the rate counts are going higher you know if you have higher rates you're going to have more deaths people have been a little bit more lacks on the npis so is it just kind of a coincidental thing or are these mutant viruses actually more transmissible yeah that's a i want to take that one it's a great question uh and and this question has been sort of put uh it's in several you know different discussion forum well there's so many evidence the the fact that that the new variant like the uk variant basically overrun all of the other previous variants suggest that there's an advantage in transmission so that's sort of an epidemiological thing if you have two variants competing for the same population and you see one becoming more and more common one of the likely explanation is that it's more transmissible so there's sort of a an indirect conclusion there's also evidence of a higher viral load uh in patients with these new variants when they compare the ct values of some of the patients with the old variants with the wuhan the original and those with with this mutation including the the 614 and and the the really variance of concern that the like the brazilian and the uk variants they seem to be more transmissible and they seem to have a higher vital load and they're trying to find explanations it's a little bit more difficult to find why that is happening uh they think that their the changes in the spike protein produces more con conformational changes in the spike and makes it more available for the receptors but i think that's that's a little bit more complicated to understand but there is both epidemiological clinical and also some basic science um uh sort of explanations to to understand what there's more transmissibility regarding severity at the beginning the the people the groups in the uk actually published that the uk environment seemed to be more severe but there have been two publications recently which basically have put that in doubt they they actually compare uh patients with and without the uk variant and they couldn't find um really you know measures of severity uh when they look at a more specific hospitalized population with both uh with either the uk or some of the original variants so i think transmissibility is accepted as a that it occurs and and um severity we're still um not sure that it's more severe that any of these variants are are really more severe what the brazilians are saying is that it's affecting younger population but we don't really know if it's a if it's sort of a consequence of vaccination of all the groups they're still looking into that into that data great thank you so much great thank you so much that's super helpful i'm gonna go ahead and just turn it back over to joanna further questions great thank you carla so much um thank you guys for all these amazing questions today too and for the hub team for providing all these uh um kind of evidence-based and evidence-guided answers there's a a question from dr yehuda pat about the indian indian variant and how the vaccine might affects that might affect that nestor and then i think dr mertz um has a question about a physician from rutgers who died over in india um uh who had been fully vaccinated in the u.s and wanted to see if you could address that um as well right i haven't really seen any papers uh on correlation with the so-called indian marian which is the b1 617 i wrote it down here because there's so many numbers i'm even i'm going crazy with all these numbers so the 617 which is the so-called indian baron has the e uh 4a4 mutation which is one of those mutant uh you know mutations associated with immune escape uh but i haven't really seen any graph comparing you know level and neutralizing antibodies with the so-called indian uh i think it's a it's a bit too soon we'll probably see it in the next few weeks and i've been waiting for the pre-publications but i haven't really seen it maybe out there but but i don't i do not really know uh how the best is and i heard about this uh physician who was fully vaccinated i think he was in the 80s so that he was 80 years old so that may be a factor and there's definitely breakthrough infections even without variance there could be breakthrough infections we know that there have been a few uh thousands of breakthrough infections in the in the united states so it's it's possible um but it's also possible that he was infected with the variant that was not uh adequately controlled by the immune response to the original vaccine i saw something online about him and it did say that um although he had covered he was never severely ill and so the vaccine did seem to protect him from severe illness he had underlying heart disease and in all likelihood the code precipitated the heart attack but he did not die from the severe cobalt he died from his underlying condition that was brought out by it so the vaccine does seem like it at least in part did what it was supposed to do thank you thank you nestor thank you leslie um maria christina garcia has a question about the vaccines against the p2 variant from from brazil and i think you've mentioned credit you mentioned um we've kind of discussed this already so i might go on to um excuse me excuse me um and then i and deborah hill mentioned um deborah hill also uh questions about should um uh guidance about people who um we have received guidance that those who are fully vaccinated two weeks out to three months out would not be considered a close oh deborah do you want to maybe an un unmute and ask your question um i thought it was a different type of question but i don't think we've addressed this no yeah sure thank you um so we've been given guidance as school nurses and others that um folks who have been fully vaccinated which means two weeks out have three months where they are not considered a close contact but we have so many people now who are beyond the three months and i've been looking around and i'm trying to figure out what is the guidance that we give um to folks who are over the three-month mark are they still considered no need to quarantine not close contact do we have any any word on extension of that time that's that's what does that make sense yeah that's a great question i don't think we have the answer yet i think this the cdc is waiting for more data on the durability of the protection we saw some data from the phase two of moderna that at least went out to four months but we haven't really seen anything beyond because people have been vaccinated just you know the last three three or four months but you're right there are people who were vaccinated late december early january and and uh except for those who participate in clinical trials the real life vaccination started in january in most places so so yeah we're five months out we need we need new guidance on this how long the protection is gonna last uh i have heard about the so-called booster that we need a booster at some point maybe at the six-month point or something but we still need more data and i think the cdc is like scrambling to find more evidence of how long the protection really lasts to to be able to extend their their recommendations on on when a person is fully vaccinated if you're five or six months out are you still fully protected or not that's that's a great question uh thank you for that great question uh deborah um kim joy has a question um nester and leslie about a patient that she had that had this significant amount of swelling on her face and arm and hand after the first vaccine um and uh anyway kim read that if if the patient were to take an ace inhibitor that it might prevent any swelling and wondered if you heard any read anything about this being evidence-based or evidence guided no i have not i have not interesting comment but i have not leslie any i haven't heard anything either okay okay thank you um and then this maybe is for cecilia um thompson do all labs have assays available to tech all the current variants it's a question from young young key markham so here i can answer for tri-core here at tri-core we are able to detect all of the major variants that are circulating in the u.s we're in constant contact with our tests and assay manufacturers to determine that that being said i don't know about every lab having that same communication but i would hope that they are doing the same as we as we are thank you cecilia just wanted to remind everyone that about 247 the cme link went into the chat as well um aline gush do you want to unmute and ask your a question a mini kind of mini case okay sure thank you um so this gentleman is 64 years old and he didn't have any underlying skin problems that we know of he hasn't had a rash in past he has a very widespread rash that is covering most of his body and it's the worst on his chest and upper back it's somewhat rough and pebbly textured there's been some weeping at times and he was given a course of oral prednisone [Music] a couple months ago and it was three days and it wasn't tapered um over the days and he became quite ill after that um after that the rash came back uh he said that he was given another course of prednisone but then they tapered it much more gradually but he was still somewhat ill so that that's right of course we don't really have that to offer him um i just started treating him with acupuncture and we had some improvement so far i'll be seeing him again today um but i i hadn't heard of anyone having a rash that lasted like this and was so widespread and it's been very itchy and and i had a lot of heat the entire time so i wondered if people have seen that and this is after after vaccination i'm sorry after vaccination the rash oh i'm sorry it was after his second shot of the moderna um the first shot was uneventful so he had the second one on february 19th and he still has the severe rash just as severe yeah no i haven't seen and and actually we i review a paper here a few weeks ago about the 12 cases of like rash associated with the with the mrna vaccines but they were really mild they were like localized in the elbows or around the area of injection for a few days after vaccination but i don't remember seeing this or he you know hearing at the description of a such a severe rush i don't know if you know maybe some of the primary care uh provider because i'm an infectious disease so i usually don't see the patient um in the communities but maybe somebody else have seen this more leslie thanks nestor let's see have you seen anything like this i have not elena actually sent me a picture of the ration it was a very impressive rash um of course we don't know 100 of us due to the vaccine you know uh although certainly timing wise it would make sense one thing i did recommend was at least um uh it's worth sending it into the american academy of dermatology as a registry for um post-vaccine rashes that they're sort of and i talked about it i think last week or the week before and it's worth sending it into that another thing is leslie we have a dermatology echo too on fridays at noon here and if you're in new mexico that might be something to consider as they they might see some dermatology um you know sequelae of the the vaccinations that's the possibility um maybe i could ask holly um who's our program coordinator to maybe send send you the link that would be great right um maybe we have time for uh kind of one more question if that's okay cynthia settles um has a really great question um and might just ask kind of everybody in our virtual room she says as we open up more what are other offices doing to see patients i'm a private pediatrician we have hepa filters in our rooms we currently see patients with coping symptoms in their car the whole office is vaccinated and my concerns are for the parents and kids coming in um coming in after and just kind of want to get a gestalt about kind of what you guys are doing are more and more of you seeing uh your ambulatory practice are you opening up your inventory practices um i know we don't do this but might you just chat in if you're you know if you're opening up just type in yes if you're not uh say no um i'll comment that we're seeing about half a third we'll say a third of our patients in clinic at this point um and about two-thirds are still telehealth um we're doing pretty much the same things we have we have had since the pandemic started we have someone screening at the front door and it's amazing how many people don't think the coffin fever actually apply to them and you know get back in the room and they're like oh well yeah it's just my usual allergies it's like ugh but um the hepa filters and we are very picky about the masks everyone has to wear a procedure mask if they come in with a cloth mask they're um and we have uh distancing and have um but it's still it is a little scary so most people thanks leslie most people are saying that they are seeing patients more and more in person right now um some are saying that they're just uh um seeing patients uh lean says that they're still being quite conservative so um my my sense is it's probably going to be opening up uh more and more and thanks holly holly lovely um just sent the dermatology echo tele teller registration so fantastic thanks holly um thanks leslie for that um just wanted to let you know we'll
